1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,599
So last time we talked about the sum

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,119
troder theorem and today I want to do

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,840
some digesting of what we learned. Um so

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,600
on the one hand the the summary trout

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,000
theorem was was um had a lot of impact

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,320
both the theorem and the proof and the

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
proof involved topology and that started

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
a whole thing of using topology and

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,880
combinotaurics

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,640
and um Tom Wolf learned about it the for

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,399
analyst Tom Wolf learned about it and he

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,239
he brought the cell decompositions and

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,360
those topological methods into fora

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,440
analysis um and had a lot of impact and

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,840
the theorem itself the statement is like

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,000
sharp and the proof is fairly short and

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,719
uh so it's really nice. Um

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
but there are some questions that are

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
closely related to the submar troder

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,920
theorem that the proof doesn't actually

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,720
tell us anything about um and so I

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,560
wanted to um go through them today and

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,400
and discuss why the proof doesn't tell

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
us much about some of these related

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
things and those those some of those

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,040
things will be the main topics of the

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,159
class going forward. Yeah.

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
Okay, so

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
I'm going to put in the board seam ready

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:31,080
trotder

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,080
theorem and proof are quite remarkable

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,119
but

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,119
they don't tell us

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,159
uh anything about some questions that

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,079
seem closely related.

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,640
Okay, so number one doesn't tell us

37
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,119
anything about projection theory in

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,119
finite fields.

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,600
Okay. Number two, it doesn't tell us

40
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,600
anything about the structure of sharp

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
examples.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
All right.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
So, we discussed a little bit last

44
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,560
class. I mentioned the sharp examples

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,440
for the sority trout theorem that we

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,680
know and and it's an interesting

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,520
question. If you have an example that is

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,440
close to being sharp for the summary

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,440
trer theorem can we say anything about

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
its structure

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,080
and it might be a little surprising but

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,319
the proof of the sad trer theorem really

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
gives no information about that and

54
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,959
we'll talk about why

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,840
okay number three so the sad tr theorem

56
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,000
is the sharp theorem about projection

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,120
theory for points sets of points in the

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,959
uklidian plane in R2 finite sets in R2.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,200
Um, so you might hope that it would tell

60
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,760
you something helpful about projection

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,159
theory for sets of unit balls in R2. Um,

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,239
but it says rather little about that. So

63
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,800
it says rather little about the

64
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,800
projection theory

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
of

66
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,440
unit balls

67
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,319
in R2 um with some spacing conditions.

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,319
So I'll put here with the housedorf

69
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,319
spacer.

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,319
This is also a little bit surprising.

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,519
And um so Tom Wolf was really interested

72
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,319
in analysis problems problems like this

73
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
and he found the sired troder proof in

74
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,599
the cominatorics literature which at

75
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
that time were like two pretty different

76
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,760
groups of mathematicians.

77
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,239
um and he imported it and he tried to

78
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
use it to answer questions like this and

79
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
he did prove a bunch of interesting

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,879
stuff but he was not able to answer this

81
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,959
question. Um and so we'll talk about

82
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,519
what the issue is why the why the

83
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,439
summarated troder proof does not say all

84
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:13,120
that much about this set.

85
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,720
Okay, cool. and uh and then going

86
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,239
forward this and this maybe this are

87
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,479
going to be some of the main topics of

88
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,479
our class.

89
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
Oh yeah and so oh and Mimi also

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,040
mentioned so you know one of the big

91
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
developments that made me excited to

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
teach the class is that there is now a

93
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,400
sharp theorem about this proven by Orpin

94
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,479
and Schmurkin and Ren and Wong. Um and

95
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,560
actually it doesn't use any of the

96
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,520
methods from the Seamaretti Troder

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,000
proof. Um so anyway so we'll talk today

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,479
sort of to explain why something

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,639
different is needed and then we'll we'll

100
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,440
meet the something different starting uh

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960
next class.

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,120
Okay.

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,800
All right. So, so why does the method

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,440
that we saw Yeah.

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,240
>> Um are there any other spaces like other

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,560
than real space where kind of a similar

107
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,120
uh memo to that kind of technical real

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,520
splitting memo works like I know like it

109
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,160
doesn't work for finite anything that's

110
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,080
kind of similar enough to real.

111
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,720
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question is the key

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,800
ingredient in the in the proof we did of

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
the summary troder theorem is this cell

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,880
decomposition lema. You can cut the

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
plane up into pieces in a way so that

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,639
each line doesn't go through too many

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,639
pieces. And the question was other than

118
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,360
R2 are there some other spaces where

119
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,600
something like this would work. Um okay

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,759
so it works to at least to some extent

121
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,000
in higher dimensions Rn. Um it uh it

122
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,960
doesn't make any sense over FP which I

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,039
was going to say in a second. Um and um

124
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,240
it works with some modifications in CN

125
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,720
um and um

126
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,600
and yeah and those are all the spaces

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,600
really I know where it works.

128
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,240
Okay. Okay. So we we just sort of

129
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,639
mentioned um so why why did these

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,360
methods not work over FP? Well, we had

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,520
this basic thing of like cutting a space

132
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
into pieces where like the simplest

133
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
thing would be like you take a line in

134
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,720
the plane and it cuts it into two

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,800
connected components, right? And um uh

136
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
that just doesn't make sense in FP2.

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
There's if you remove a line from FP2,

138
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,240
there's no sense in which what's left

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,759
over is organized into two components.

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
Okay, so this one is not that

141
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840
surprising. Um, and these are a little

142
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
more surprising and we I think we need

143
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,440
to talk in some more depth to explain

144
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,440
why we didn't learn anything about them.

145
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Okay.

146
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,440
All right. So, let's first we'll talk

147
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,840
about the structure of sharp examples

148
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,759
for the ST theorem. And let me first

149
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,800
remind you what the ST theorem says and

150
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,400
what are the sharp examples. Uh, okay.

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,880
So, the theorem was this. So I have a

152
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:10,400
set X is a set of points in the plane

153
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,840
and L is a set of lines in the plane

154
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
and then we're going to count the

155
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,160
incidences between them. Theorem says

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,639
that the number of incidences between X

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,120
and L is bounded by the number of points

158
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,680
plus the number of lines plus a more

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,680
complicated term.

160
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,280
Okay. And I will just label these terms

161
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,280
one and two and three.

162
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,160
Okay, so a situation where where term

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,160
one dominates

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,800
is easy to imagine. We just need to put

165
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,680
each point on a line. So I'll draw some

166
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,160
lines and then each point I will put on

167
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,160
one of these lines.

168
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,520
Okay. So this type of example I would

169
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,280
describe as not having any remarkable

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,199
structure. Um so this is uh not rigid

171
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,199
and there are many degrees of freedom.

172
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,599
So there's no so I would say no special

173
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,599
structure here.

174
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,680
It's not rigid.

175
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,639
Um there are many degrees of freedom.

176
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,680
Each one of these points I can slide

177
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,759
freely along this line. So I have at

178
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,159
least x degrees of freedom. All right.

179
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,760
Now, example, the situation where two

180
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,039
dominates,

181
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,719
the picture is a little bit different,

182
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,599
but it's similar. Um, so to have L

183
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,399
incences, I just need that each line

184
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,000
goes through a point. So there's a few

185
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,360
points. I put them anywhere. And then

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm going to draw my lines. And each

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,720
line it will go through one of these

188
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,720
points. So it just looks like Oops.

189
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,440
looks like that. Sometimes called the

190
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
stars example.

191
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
Okay. And again, there's no special

192
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,440
structure. It's not rigid. There are

193
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,959
many degrees of freedom. I can rotate

194
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,320
this line and so

195
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,399
okay. And then example three when this

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
term dominates those are harder to come

197
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
by and they have more structure and

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,240
they're more interesting. So the known

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,240
examples

200
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,279
are an integer grid

201
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,800
integer

202
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,440
grid

203
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,080
or uh instead of the integers you could

204
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,160
take a ring like a ring in a number

205
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,120
field this time kind of grid or more

206
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,560
generally you could take an R grid where

207
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,560
R is the ring of integers.

208
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,789
and a number fit.

209
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,789
[Applause]

210
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,560
Okay. Um draw a little picture.

211
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,120
All right. So this is the scenario where

212
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,519
the the known examples have structure.

213
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:17,240
Um we have structure

214
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,240
in the known examples

215
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,360
and we have very few degrees of freedom

216
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,360
to determine these examples.

217
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,079
>> Cool. Okay. Were there any questions or

218
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,760
comments?

219
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,560
>> Yeah. If you embed R2 into the real

220
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,120
projective plane, there's like a duality

221
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,000
that takes lines in the real projective

222
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,040
plane to points and switches points with

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,440
lines and it preserves intersections.

224
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,760
>> And it seems to me like the first two

225
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,920
classes of example are kind of dual when

226
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,040
you do that. Is the third class of

227
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,120
examples like self duel if you do that

228
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,600
kind of uh switching lines and points?

229
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,200
>> Yeah. Okay. That's a great question. Let

230
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
me just repeat it for everybody. So

231
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,160
there's a structure called point line

232
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,160
duality. Um so

233
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,279
it's probably nicest to explain it in

234
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,040
the um

235
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,120
uh in the projector space, but let me

236
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,360
say it in a low brown way. In a low brow

237
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,720
way. So if I have a line y, I can

238
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:35,920
probably write it as y = mx + b.

239
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,760
In other words, um, and let me do this

240
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,560
is a little sound a little silly, but

241
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm going to write as mx minus b. Why

242
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:48,000
not? Okay, so in other words, the line

243
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,640
is 0 = mx - b minus y.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,680
Okay. So if I have a set of points it

245
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:58,720
would be you know x1 y1

246
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:02,160
xn yn points. If I have a set of lines,

247
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,519
they might be M1 B1

248
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:10,680
and then M um

249
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,680
L B L if I have L lines.

250
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,360
And um if I want to count incidences, I

251
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,320
consider a different point, different

252
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,040
line and I check this equation. And this

253
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,760
equation is actually symmetric

254
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,880
if you replace if you switch the role of

255
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,880
MB and the role of XY.

256
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,480
So I can turn my points into lines and

257
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,440
turn my lines into points.

258
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,839
So this is

259
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,800
symmetric. If I take MB and switch it

260
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,000
with XY.

261
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,880
Okay. So as student pointed out if you

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
take this example and then you apply

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,040
point line duality you get this example.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,839
So this line here became that point

265
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,399
these points became those lines and so

266
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,519
on. So these two examples are dual to

267
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,800
each other. All right. Now the question

268
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,440
was if you take this example and you

269
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,600
apply point line duality what do you

270
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:21,760
get? Yeah. Um and um you actually do get

271
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:24,760
something different. Um so so you can

272
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,760
apply

273
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,800
point line duality

274
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,360
right all right so to to think about

275
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,120
what would happen if we did this I won't

276
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,880
do it in complete detail but but let's

277
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,480
sort of take a first step um so when I

278
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,519
do that each one of these lines will

279
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,720
become a point and the uh the point will

280
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,800
be labeled like m. So the the

281
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,680
xcoordinate of our point will be the

282
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,160
slope. So who were the slopes of these

283
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,240
lines? Well, when we constructed them,

284
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,480
the slopes were rational numbers with

285
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,920
small denominators. So those will be the

286
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
x coordinates. They'll be rational

287
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,240
numbers with small denominators. And

288
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,079
then for each x coordinate, the

289
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,000
y-coordinates will be the different b

290
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,240
values. So the different, you know, the

291
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,279
places where it hits the y- axis. And

292
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,519
you can compute that with a little work.

293
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,680
um and you get a set which is not a grid

294
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,279
actually. It's not an integer grid. So

295
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,680
you know the set of rationals with small

296
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:32,079
denominators that's not uh um I say it's

297
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,839
not um integer multiples of one number.

298
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,839
Uh so it is actually a genuinely

299
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,800
different example when you switch the

300
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,639
the points and the lines. Yeah. So

301
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,480
that's great. Um and the other thing we

302
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,959
mentioned last time is that we can apply

303
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,959
projective transformations.

304
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,240
Okay. Um so this list of examples is a

305
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,240
little bit messy. There are a few of

306
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,639
them but it's a little bit messy. And

307
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,639
that perhaps has contributed to making

308
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,560
it feel daunting to prove that all the

309
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,000
examples look like one of these.

310
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,399
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Great.

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,399
Great question.

312
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,800
Okay. So, um, so next I thought that we

313
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,959
would go over a bit the proof of the sum

314
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
theorem with an eye towards what does it

315
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,120
tell us about the structure of sharp

316
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,040
examples and unfortunately we'll see

317
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,279
tells us very little but but it's good

318
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,279
to see it.

319
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:53,399
Okay, so the first step in the proof was

320
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,399
a double counting argument

321
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,240
and a double counting argument proved a

322
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,920
weaker upper bound for the number of

323
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,920
incidences which was this

324
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,120
Um and that double counting argument has

325
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
a corlary which is perhaps easier to say

326
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,240
and the correlary is actually the only

327
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,040
thing you really need to prove the

328
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,040
summary troder theorem. The correlary

329
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,920
says that if the number of lines is more

330
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,199
than the number of points squared

331
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,839
then the number of incidences is just

332
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:32,240
bounded by the number of lines which is

333
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
in other words it matches the case two

334
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
over here. The picture looks like this

335
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,399
where a typical line just goes through

336
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,399
one of the points.

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,399
Okay,

338
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,839
cool. Um, so actually that's I didn't

339
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
emphasize that last time, but that's a

340
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,800
nice thing to say because this coralary

341
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,959
is maybe easier to hold in our mind than

342
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:58,399
the whatever the exponents are up there.

343
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,519
Okay, so now the next idea was this uh

344
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,519
cell decomposition idea.

345
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,240
Um so let me draw an example for some

346
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,160
ready troder and then I'll draw the cell

347
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,720
decomposition and we'll talk about how

348
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,720
it's helping us.

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,640
Okay. So I'll have a set of points like

350
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:28,360
that might it might be an integer grid

351
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,360
and then I have some lines here. um

352
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,679
lines at those slopes,

353
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,679
lines at these slopes,

354
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,400
okay? Etc.

355
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,760
And then we will do a cell

356
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
decomposition.

357
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Those

358
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,000
are our cells. It's our cell wall. And

359
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,000
here are our our cells. O subi.

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,520
Okay.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,120
So let's say xi

362
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,080
is

363
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:20,400
x intersected with oi and li is the set

364
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,960
of lines so that l intersect o y is not

365
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,960
empty.

366
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,600
Okay.

367
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,640
And um what we what we can can do with

368
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,720
the cell decomposition is that we we

369
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,559
choose our cell decomposition fine

370
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,160
enough.

371
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,440
So the cell decomposition has a

372
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,280
parameter s. Um

373
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,919
there's a parameter s

374
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,960
and in terms of this parameter um x i is

375
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,559
like x over s^2.

376
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
So there you can think of there being s

377
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,080
squared cells and the points are

378
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:08,320
distributed evenly among them and li is

379
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,240
at most x over s

380
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,240
and in sharp examples this would be an

381
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
equality.

382
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:21,760
Okay. Um, so what we do is we do the

383
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:26,880
cell decomposition fine enough

384
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:30,600
so that li is bigger than xi squared and

385
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,600
then we use the correlate.

386
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Okay.

387
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,280
Okay. So why does this not help us very

388
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,080
much? Uh why does this not help very

389
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,679
much to understand the structure? So

390
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,160
what what we're going to what we've done

391
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,679
here is we've cut our original we've cut

392
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,640
our space into cells and we're going to

393
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,799
look one cell at a time. In each cell we

394
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,480
see a ton of lines and not that many

395
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,039
points.

396
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,679
And then by double counting we can

397
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:17,440
deduce that in each cell we have this

398
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,559
bound. Um so we use our corlary it says

399
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:26,200
that the number of incidences between x

400
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,200
i and li is at most around l.

401
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:35,080
So within each cell uh a typical line is

402
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,080
only hitting one point within the cell.

403
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,559
Okay.

404
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,720
So this divide and conquer argument,

405
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,240
we're cutting space up into cells and

406
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,000
then we're thinking about them one at a

407
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,919
time. And doing that simplifies our life

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,360
because we have some we've broken our

409
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,840
problem into smaller problems and we

410
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,679
just think about them one at a time. And

411
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,120
we understand each smaller problem well

412
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,039
enough to bound the total number of

413
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,840
incidences.

414
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,400
But um we are not paying attention to

415
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,400
any possible sort of interaction between

416
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,120
these cells.

417
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Um and the the structure is all about

418
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,240
the interaction between the cells.

419
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,480
Um so you know a given a given line in

420
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,480
our story

421
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,799
is actually uh appearing in many

422
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,960
different cells. And so there's some

423
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,559
relationship about between what's going

424
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,360
on in this cell and what's going on in

425
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,120
that cell. And in our proof, we're not

426
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
trying to understand or exploit that

427
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,679
relationship. We're just looking at the

428
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,520
cells one at a time.

429
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,000
Anyway, so the only structure that the

430
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,840
proof gives us is that within each cell,

431
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,679
you see some points and you each you see

432
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,400
some lines and each line only goes

433
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,360
through one point within the cell, which

434
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,480
is not yet a rigid structure at all. And

435
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,480
that's all that the proof gives us.

436
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,360
Okay. Any questions or comments about

437
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,360
that?

438
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,799
Um so so I have been wondering about

439
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,000
this question of uh of structure of

440
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,240
sharp examples and I thought of a

441
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,480
direction that you know that could that

442
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,799
pe people were interested people could

443
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,480
pursue as a project and I wanted to put

444
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,000
it out there. So take 10 or 15 minutes

445
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,919
to share like a project idea of um of

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
some I don't know sort of smaller

447
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,159
problems that would might build up

448
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,159
towards understanding this.

449
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:55,200
So here was my thought. Um okay so first

450
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,760
of all the the this general incidence

451
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,120
theorem implies a projection theorem.

452
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
The projection theorem is more

453
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,159
specialized and I think it might be

454
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,039
easier to understand the sharp examples

455
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,039
for the projection theorem.

456
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,039
Um,

457
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,799
okay. So, I called it a theorem last

458
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,320
time. We could also call it a corlary.

459
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:29,720
So, X is contained in R2 is a finite

460
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,720
set. D is a set of directions.

461
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,720
Um and then um s of xd

462
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:45,120
is the maximum over all of the

463
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,840
directions of the size of pi theta of x.

464
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,919
And um the way I've stated the theorem

465
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,159
before is that the number of directions

466
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,640
is at most 1 + s^2 over the number of

467
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,880
points. But algebraically it's

468
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,039
equivalent to say the following thing.

469
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,400
If the number of directions is at least

470
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:08,400
two, then s is at least x to the 12 d to

471
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,799
the 12.

472
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,799
That's just algebra.

473
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,679
The case where the number of directions

474
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,520
is just one is not very interesting. If

475
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,039
you're only projecting in one direction,

476
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,240
it could easily happen that the

477
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,240
projection has only one point.

478
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay.

479
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,080
So this is a very special case of this.

480
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,240
In this case, what are the lines? The

481
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,799
set of lines are all of the lines that

482
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,360
are in these directions and pass through

483
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,200
at least one of these points. So that's

484
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,039
a very particular way of choosing the

485
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,480
lines

486
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,480
and there are not as many sharp

487
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,480
examples.

488
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,520
So taking one of these grids and then um

489
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,440
taking a a a set a set of directions

490
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,520
that are rational numbers with small

491
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,440
numerators and denominators. That's a

492
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,720
sharp example for this.

493
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,880
I think if you apply point line duality

494
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,799
that it it's still a sharp example for

495
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,919
summary trotder but I don't think it is

496
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,120
a projection example anymore.

497
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,919
Um so let's see.

498
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,720
So being

499
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,600
so being a projection example means that

500
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,480
for every point

501
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,039
all of the lines going through it have

502
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,679
the same set of slopes. Those are the

503
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:39,360
directions we're projecting.

504
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:44,559
So if I applied point line duality

505
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,960
that would mean that for every line

506
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,520
um

507
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,919
uh the set of xcoordinates where it

508
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,960
intersects a point would be the same and

509
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,960
and that's not true here.

510
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,919
Maybe it's better. You may have check on

511
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,919
your own. But so I so I claim if you if

512
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,360
you apply point line duality, you don't

513
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,440
anymore have an example with this

514
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,120
projection structure.

515
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,279
Also, if you apply a projective

516
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,960
transformation, then you will ruin the

517
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,000
fact that there were parallel lines

518
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,000
here. Um so that the directions the

519
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,840
direct you know after projective

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,279
transformation lines that used to point

521
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,039
in the same direction won't point in the

522
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,679
same direction anymore. So that won't be

523
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,080
a projective example either. So the

524
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,520
class of known sharp examples is smaller

525
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,520
which makes it a little more hopeful

526
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,919
that we could understand it. It is

527
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,919
actually just grids over number fields.

528
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:44,559
Okay.

529
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:46,559
Now once we set the problem up this way,

530
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,640
you could imagine

531
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,080
fixing the set D in advance

532
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,000
and then just for that set of

533
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,000
projections considering different sets X

534
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
and seeing what happens. And so you get

535
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,120
actually lots of different problems

536
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,120
depending on what set of directions you

537
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,120
fix.

538
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,200
So let's write that down.

539
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:27,600
All right. So for any set D,

540
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:33,760
S subd of N be the minimum over any set

541
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:36,159
of end points of um SXD

542
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,039
which remember what that is. So it's the

543
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,320
minimum over any set of points of the

544
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:47,000
maximum over these different projections

545
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,000
of pi theta of x.

546
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,880
Okay. So

547
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,159
yeah. So so in my opinion for any set d

548
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,080
that you write down it's interesting to

549
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,000
try to estimate this. So now we have

550
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,600
lots and lots of questions and most of

551
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,200
those questions have not been

552
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,760
investigated all that much.

553
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,440
Uh okay. Now in the in the sharp

554
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,440
examples that we know about who is D

555
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,919
in the known sharp examples

556
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:32,279
the set D is uh rational numbers with

557
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,279
small numerators and denominators.

558
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,480
uh or

559
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,320
um rational fractions in some other

560
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,960
ring. So this is a ring of integers in a

561
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,960
in a number field.

562
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,760
And then I'll say this just more

563
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,760
informally. A and b are small.

564
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,919
So maybe the number field are things of

565
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:10,279
the form a1 plus square<unk> of 2 a2 and

566
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,279
a1 and a2 are small integers.

567
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:16,559
Okay. So in all the known sharp examples

568
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,159
these are the sets of directions and

569
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,039
they have quite a lot of algebraic

570
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,679
structure. And so we could ask the

571
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,919
question if we fix a set of directions

572
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,039
that does not have so much algebraic

573
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:32,039
structure then can we get a better

574
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,039
estimate?

575
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,840
All right.

576
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,960
Okay.

577
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,559
Um so let's think about um you know we

578
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,200
we begin with the simplest problem that

579
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,640
we can. Um so let's take just a few

580
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,760
directions, two directions, three

581
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,399
directions, four directions. All

582
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,640
right. So, um remark there is some um

583
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,640
linear transformation symmetry in this

584
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
problem.

585
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,120
Right? So, if I start with the

586
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,279
configuration of points and some

587
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,600
directions, I can apply a linear change

588
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,960
of variables to R2. I'll get a new

589
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,799
configuration of points and I'll get

590
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,080
some new directions, but it's it'll be

591
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,760
the same problem just in new

592
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,760
coordinates.

593
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Um so uh up to symmetry

594
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,840
if you take just three directions

595
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,399
um then you there there's only one

596
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,080
choice up to symmetry. So the set of

597
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,760
directions

598
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,159
ah okay actually let me say something

599
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,919
else. So okay so up to symmetry if there

600
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,159
are three directions then there's only

601
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,159
one choice.

602
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,240
Um, okay. Let me make a comment about

603
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,880
how to write down the directions. I

604
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,679
actually already was using it without uh

605
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,880
without explaining it properly. So, this

606
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:59,200
is the list of slopes of the directions,

607
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:03,960
right? Okay. Um, so

608
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,960
so let's describe our our projections

609
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:18,480
as pi t of x1 x2 is x1 + t * x2.

610
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,399
Right? So for this this investigation,

611
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,080
this t is more or less the slope of the

612
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,760
projection. And that is a more

613
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,640
convenient thing to talk about than the

614
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,240
angle in radians.

615
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,840
And and that was what we were writing up

616
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,440
here.

617
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:38,640
Okay. So um

618
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:41,600
uh cool. So for example, pi 0 of x1 x2

619
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,000
would just be x1. And the other simplest

620
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,360
projection would be just to take x2 and

621
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,080
that doesn't quite fit into this

622
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,240
notation. But um there's a convention

623
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,399
that we'll call that pi infinity. Pi

624
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,080
infinity of x1 x2 is just x

625
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,679
and then all the you know all the other

626
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,080
ones will be t will be a real number.

627
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,360
Okay. So,

628
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,320
so if d equals 3

629
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,480
um then without loss of generality d

630
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,480
might be 0 1 and infinity.

631
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,550
Okay.

632
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,710
And um

633
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,710
[Applause]

634
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,399
Okay.

635
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,320
Um, all right. So, let me copy down what

636
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:54,880
the samurai troder theorem says for

637
00:32:50,320 --> 00:33:01,200
comparison. says for any set D uh S subd

638
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,720
of N is at least D to the 12 N to the 12

639
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,159
as long for as long as there are at

640
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:11,519
least two points.

641
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:13,679
Um so if D is 01 infinity or any set of

642
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,039
three ele three slopes because it's all

643
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,279
the same um this is sharp.

644
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,640
Um for instance that you could take an n

645
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:26,039
byn integer grid or n half by n the half

646
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,039
integer grid.

647
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,240
Okay. So there's nothing new for three

648
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,240
directions. Let's go to four directions.

649
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,039
Okay. By using our symmetry we can

650
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,080
arrange that the first three directions

651
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,480
are 0 1 and infinity. and there'll be a

652
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,919
fourth direction t and t could be any

653
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,360
real number. So we have one degree of

654
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,519
freedom how we would choose four

655
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,200
directions.

656
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,440
Okay.

657
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,480
So on and the one extreme we could

658
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,480
choose t to be like a half or two and

659
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,120
this so this would be rational with a

660
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,039
small size

661
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,359
and then the other extreme we could say

662
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,919
that t t might be a transcendental

663
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,679
number and somewhere in the middle we

664
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,280
would have roo<unk>2 or like a big

665
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,839
rational number like a thousand or

666
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,560
something like that.

667
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:25,720
Okay. Now in this case um uh the theorem

668
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,720
is sharp

669
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,919
that so the example that we have with

670
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,480
four directions the the four directions

671
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,280
would be these

672
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,159
and in this case let's question what

673
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,720
would happen so let me write a specific

674
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:52,960
question so question

675
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:56,359
if t so if E is 0 1 infinity and T where

676
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,359
T is transcendental.

677
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:06,240
Then

678
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:09,640
is it true that SD of N is bounded by N

679
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,640
to the 12.

680
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,680
So it's at least N to the 1/2. If the

681
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,680
theorem is sharp, it would be

682
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,200
approximately n to the half. But if the

683
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,440
theorem is not sharp and we can improve

684
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,440
it, it might be bigger than this.

685
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,160
My best guess is that it's bigger than

686
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,880
this. And I played around a little bit

687
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:37,240
with examples and I can show you the uh

688
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,240
best example that I can find.

689
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Okay.

690
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,880
Okay. So example

691
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,240
let me say that P ks

692
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:16,000
is the set of polomials in this

693
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:20,320
transcendental number t. So a 0 + a1 t +

694
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,119
a k minus1 t the k minus one. So they're

695
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,560
degree k polomials

696
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:32,040
and the a's are integers

697
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,040
and they have size up to s. So let's say

698
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,320
so that guy is going to kind of play the

699
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,720
role like integers from one up to s um

700
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,320
in in that that would have worked well

701
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:53,440
if we had a rational slope.

702
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,520
Okay. So now our set s is going to be

703
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,280
pks times pks. K and s of course are

704
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,160
parameters. So we can play with them and

705
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,960
sort of see what's optimal.

706
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,119
So the size of X is S to the 2K. The

707
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,960
size of this thing is S to the K. We

708
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,880
have K choices and S S choices for each

709
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,280
of AI.

710
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,040
Okay. Now what happens when we project

711
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,000
X?

712
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,200
Pi 0 of X projection onto the first

713
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,160
coordinate is just PKS and pi infinity

714
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,280
of X is projection onto the second

715
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,520
coordinate that's just PKS.

716
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,000
Those are quite small. Best we could

717
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,800
hope for really.

718
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,880
Now what is pi one of X?

719
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,680
Pi one of X is I take an element of here

720
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,000
and I add it to an element of here. So

721
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,839
I'm going to add this set to itself.

722
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,160
When I take two of these polomials and

723
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,560
add them together, I get a new polomial

724
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,599
and I just add the coefficients. So the

725
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,079
new constant the old um the the constant

726
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,560
coefficient was between 0 and s minus

727
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,400
one and I add up two of those. The sum

728
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:15,480
is between zero and 2s basically. So pi

729
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,480
1 of x is contained in p k comma 2s

730
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,160
and it's pretty much equal to that.

731
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,160
All right.

732
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,800
Now what happens if I take pi t of x?

733
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,520
Well pi t of x means I'm going to take

734
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,119
x1 which is in here and I'm going to add

735
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,640
it to t * x2. x2 lives in here. I'm

736
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,320
going to multiply it by t and add it to

737
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,560
x1.

738
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,400
Right? All right. And this is it's this

739
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
is the most important one. And these

740
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,240
were designed to make this reasonably

741
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,400
small.

742
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:57,119
So what's going to happen? Um well t *

743
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,200
x2 is going to be a polomial like this.

744
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,520
But it will have degree k instead of k

745
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,320
minus one.

746
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,800
And then I will add it to x1 which is a

747
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,760
polomial like this. when I put them

748
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,040
together I'll get a polomial of degree K

749
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:19,760
and the coefficients will be up to 2s.

750
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:21,599
So this is contained in P k + 1 2s

751
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,599
and this one is the largest of the four

752
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,599
projections.

753
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,119
It's a bit smaller than this but I doubt

754
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,160
that it matters very much. So let's just

755
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,760
think of it as being about this big.

756
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,839
All right.

757
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,680
So s is the size of the biggest

758
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,280
projection. This one is the biggest

759
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,400
projection.

760
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:50,920
And that is roughly um 2s

761
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,920
to the k + one.

762
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:00,000
All right. So let me digest it a little

763
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:04,400
bit. It's 2 to the k + one. The plus one

764
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,240
doesn't matter very much. and then s

765
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,640
and then s to the k.

766
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,240
S to the k is the square root of x.

767
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,839
That's our sort of what we're shooting

768
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,480
for. We're trying to get as as close as

769
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:21,040
we can to the square root of x. It's 2

770
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,560
to the k um and there's x to the 12. And

771
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:29,640
then there's an s here. And the s is the

772
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,640
size of x to the 1 / 2 k.

773
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,599
Okay, so I want to try to get as close

774
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,320
to this as I can. So I want to minimize

775
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:47,160
this thing. So now we're going to choose

776
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,160
K to minimize it.

777
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,240
K should also be an integer, but that's

778
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,240
not a not a big issue.

779
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Cool.

780
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,119
Okay. Well, if I want to minimize this

781
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,040
product, at least roughly, the thing to

782
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,720
do is to make this one equal to this

783
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,000
one.

784
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:13,760
So, let's set 2 the k to be equal to x^

785
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,839
the 1 / 2k. And now we'll solve for k.

786
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:21,599
First, I raise both sides to the 2k

787
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:23,280
power. So, I get 2 to the 2k^ 2 is x.

788
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,800
Now, I'll take the logarithm of both

789
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,640
sides. So 2 k^2 is the logarithm base 2

790
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,240
of x.

791
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,720
And now I'll solve for k. And there's

792
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,280
some constants that uh let's not worry

793
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,880
about too much. So k is k is equal to

794
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,880
some constant time the log of x to the

795
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,880
12.

796
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,599
Okay. So now how big was this thing?

797
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,839
It's uh either one of these things are

798
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,720
equal to each other. And this one is

799
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,720
maybe easier to understand. It's two to

800
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,720
that.

801
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:12,960
So our s uh subd of this set x is like

802
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,079
um e to a constant

803
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,720
log of x to the 12

804
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,720
x to the 12.

805
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,400
All right. So asmtoically as the size of

806
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,680
x goes to infinity this thing is smaller

807
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,680
than x to the 0.51.

808
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,160
But it's also you know this thing is

809
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,760
bigger than any constant. It is going to

810
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:47,400
infinity. So it's also not less less

811
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,400
some x to the 1/2.

812
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:57,599
Okay, so this was just one example.

813
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:03,520
S subd of N. Um, so this tells us that S

814
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:08,560
subd of N is less than E to a constant

815
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,720
log of N to the 12 N to the 12.

816
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,119
And this by definition is the minimum

817
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,000
over all the possible sets X of size N.

818
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,880
And this was just one of them. Um but I

819
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,160
think it's plausible that this is the

820
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,880
this is the one with smallest

821
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,400
projections.

822
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,319
Okay.

823
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,720
So

824
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,119
so plausibly that gives a sense of how

825
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,880
thing for for four directions how do

826
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,880
things change when you go from a the

827
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,640
from a transcendental thing on the one

828
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,040
side to a very nice rational slope on

829
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,040
the other side.

830
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,200
Okay, cool. And that I mean that's sort

831
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,599
of the beginning of an investigation. Of

832
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,280
course, we could have more directions.

833
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:02,040
Um,

834
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,040
so we have many questions.

835
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,720
Yeah. So, four directions is already

836
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,599
complicated enough to be interesting.

837
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,040
Um, but wow, we could also have many

838
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,280
directions and so we would have lots

839
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,280
more questions.

840
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:36,079
So, more questions.

841
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,520
Um, so maybe D is 0, one, and infinity.

842
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:44,079
And then a bunch more directions.

843
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:46,560
So we have r directions and the you know

844
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,480
the

845
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,319
the sharp example these guys were

846
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,359
rational numbers or rational numbers in

847
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:57,440
some field and with small heights. Um

848
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:59,920
the opposite of that would be um maybe

849
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,839
t1 up to tr are algebraically

850
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,440
independent over q.

851
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,800
So they're each transcendental but even

852
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,640
more than that there's no algebraic

853
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,160
relation among all of them. This would

854
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,760
be sort of the most transcendental

855
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,400
situation.

856
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,040
Um so then

857
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,040
how does this behave?

858
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Um

859
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,119
and then there's stuff in the middle. So

860
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,520
maybe these guys could live in a field

861
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,359
extension of Q which is like pretty

862
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,720
complicated. And so potentially there

863
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,520
could be an interaction between

864
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,200
algebraic number theory where is a

865
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,440
discipline that describes like who are

866
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,000
the field extensions of Q. How do you

867
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,000
think about them? Um with projection

868
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
theory.

869
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,480
Cool. So people coming into the class

870
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,920
have different backgrounds. I'm not sure

871
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,400
if there's anyone who does number theory

872
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,680
and algebraic number theory.

873
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Um but um anyway, so so this is a

874
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,800
possible project. In the weeks ahead,

875
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,000
we'll be talking more about different

876
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,680
different types of projects and

877
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,440
everybody can pick out something that

878
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,079
they want to work on for their final

879
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,079
project for the class.

880
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,720
Cool. Okay. Any other qu any questions

881
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,319
or comments about about this? This is my

882
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:29,599
my stab at having some warm-up questions

883
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,280
to that that lead towards thinking about

884
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,760
um the structure of sharp examples for

885
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,760
summary trotder.

886
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,640
>> From what you're saying, you expect that

887
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,760
you can prove something stronger for

888
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,319
this case where everything is

889
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,319
algebraically independent.

890
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,480
>> Yeah, if I had to guess, so I think the

891
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,119
question is what do I guess is true?

892
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,920
Um if I had to guess, I would guess that

893
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:01,200
there are um there are sorry this should

894
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,000
be s subd of n. There are much stronger

895
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,480
lower bounds for this than the than this

896
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,160
already trotder. If these are all trans

897
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,640
this is a if there are no algebraic

898
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,640
relations there.

899
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,560
Yeah. So for you know for this setup you

900
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,720
could make a class of examples that is

901
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,880
kind of like this class but instead of

902
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,640
having polomials in just one thing T

903
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,400
there would be polinomials in T1 up to

904
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,079
TR.

905
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,240
Um, and I don't know if you could count

906
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,000
the total degree or I'm not sure.

907
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,440
Anyway, so there's some some example you

908
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,960
could get your hands on and I think it's

909
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,560
plausible that that's the sharp example

910
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,160
and I think it's plausible the bounds

911
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,640
are much stronger than the general

912
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,720
summarity tryer bound and I would be

913
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,000
really interested to or I could be wrong

914
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,560
also but I would be really interested in

915
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,560
in either case.

916
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,319
Okay. So um let's circle back to our

917
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,800
class outline.

918
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,640
So the summarated trder proof uh doesn't

919
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,240
tell us much about projection theory for

920
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,880
finite fields. We'll talk more about

921
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,480
that next class. It doesn't tell us much

922
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,880
about the structure of sharp examples

923
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,640
for the semirder theorem over the reals.

924
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,160
We just talked about that. And it

925
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,720
doesn't tell us very much about

926
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,480
projection theory for unit balls. So

927
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,880
let's talk about this one. This is

928
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,760
perhaps the central topic in our class.

929
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,000
And let's see what the problem is. Why

930
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,400
um you know this complete elegant

931
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,119
solution of the projection problem for

932
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,800
points in R2 doesn't tell us very much

933
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,200
about the projection problem for unit

934
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,200
balls in R2.

935
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,640
All right. So first um let's recall what

936
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:03,559
is what is the projection problem for

937
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,559
unit balls and what is house spacing.

938
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,079
Uh all right.

939
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,640
So set up.

940
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,640
All right. Let me write.

941
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,760
All right. So X is now a set of unit

942
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,760
balls

943
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,400
in the ball of radius R in R2.

944
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,240
And D is a set of directions. So I'm

945
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,599
going to think of it as a subset of the

946
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,760
circle. Um and it their directions are 1

947
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,440
/ r separated because otherwise they

948
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,880
would be sort of equivalent from the

949
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:58,000
point of view of projecting some unit

950
00:49:52,880 --> 00:50:01,400
balls in BR. All right. S of XD is the

951
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,400
largest projection.

952
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,680
All right. And this symbol is now doing

953
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,280
double duty. and we're thinking of it as

954
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,640
the length of the projection.

955
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,559
Okay. So,

956
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,040
so we, so we'd like to understand how

957
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,440
these things behave. Um, but besides

958
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,440
looking at this cardality of X and the

959
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,000
cardality of D, we're also going to pay

960
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,119
attention to their spacing.

961
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,480
So, n subx of r

962
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:37,040
is the maximum of x intersected with a

963
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,240
ball of radius little r with any center.

964
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:45,040
So it's the maximum over this center

965
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:49,040
and n subd of row is the maximum

966
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:52,240
of d intercept gamma where gamma is an

967
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,520
arc of length row in the circle. So this

968
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:58,960
describes how x and d are packed at

969
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,960
smaller scales or how they're spaced.

970
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,960
Um

971
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:11,440
so hidorf spacing means

972
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:15,440
that x is around r to the alpha for some

973
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:19,839
pre parameter alpha and n subx of little

974
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,160
r is bounded by little r to the alpha.

975
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,680
That's how direct spacing for x. How's

976
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,280
our spacing for the directions would be

977
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:31,760
the number of directions is r to the

978
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:36,200
beta and um nd of little r over big r is

979
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,200
bounded by little r to the beta.

980
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,119
Okay, so this informally says that the

981
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,800
balls of x are not kind of packed too

982
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,240
much into a smaller ball and the

983
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,160
directions are not kind of packed too

984
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,640
much into a smaller direction into a

985
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:53,760
small band of directions.

986
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:56,240
um you know these exact conditions

987
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,599
it's not the only conditions one might

988
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,800
be interested in. It's not the only

989
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,720
spacing condition that might be

990
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,000
interesting to think about, but it's one

991
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,800
of the most popular ones. And it has it

992
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,040
has sort of turned out that the most

993
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,400
interesting math has come up by trying

994
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,079
to understand these conditions.

995
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,319
And they come up they come up naturally

996
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,319
in some points of view even though

997
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,680
they're also I will argue that other

998
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,079
spacing conditions are helpful to

999
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,079
consider sometimes.

1000
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:30,720
So that's housed door spacing. Um and um

1001
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,720
the analog of the summary trotder

1002
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,480
problem is going to be try to understand

1003
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:39,839
this if x and d have house door spacing.

1004
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:43,040
So question

1005
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:46,920
if x and d

1006
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,920
have house door spacing.

1007
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,680
Wow. Let me put up a conjecture

1008
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,240
which is even now a theorem.

1009
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,400
Um then

1010
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,839
d is less

1011
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,839
s^2 x + one.

1012
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,920
Okay. So this was an old conjecture and

1013
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,359
now it's a theorem proven by orin and

1014
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,599
merkin and red and wong. Um and it's

1015
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,119
totally analogous to the semi troder

1016
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,839
projection theorem for finite point

1017
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,440
sets. But the proof of the semi rider

1018
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,760
theorem doesn't help very much to prove

1019
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:26,520
this thing.

1020
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,520
Okay. So what goes wrong?

1021
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,640
Um

1022
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,640
okay.

1023
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:51,200
So

1024
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:55,000
um so let's try to use the cell

1025
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,000
decomposition method.

1026
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,280
So here's X

1027
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,760
Actually,

1028
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,280
let me back up a second. Um, so to see

1029
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,359
what goes wrong, it helps to remember

1030
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,520
how the cell decomposition method worked

1031
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,680
for the original semir Troder theorem,

1032
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,680
which we did go over, but let me go over

1033
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,680
it in the context of this projection

1034
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,040
theorem. And so you can see how it looks

1035
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:40,040
there, so that we'll be able to compare.

1036
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Um,

1037
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,110
all right.

1038
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,110
[Applause]

1039
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,920
I do realize that this is maybe the

1040
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,599
third time that we have outlined the

1041
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,839
proof of this ever troder theorem with

1042
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,680
the cell decompositions, but well really

1043
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:02,640
good pieces of math. It's okay to see a

1044
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,920
few times.

1045
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:11,359
All right. So

1046
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:14,359
sketch of ST proof um ST projection

1047
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,359
proof

1048
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,319
using um cell decompositions.

1049
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,359
Okay. So we have a set X of points.

1050
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:36,680
So here's X and then I cut it into cells

1051
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:42,880
and X I

1052
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,880
is X intersect OI. I'm going to do my

1053
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,640
cell decomposition

1054
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,640
and it has a parameter

1055
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,559
uh which I I called S before but I'm

1056
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,280
going to call it sigma now because we

1057
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,359
have this other letter S and uh it gets

1058
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:02,160
confusing.

1059
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:05,160
So the size of X I is like X over sigma

1060
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,160
squ.

1061
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,599
Okay. Um,

1062
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:17,520
now

1063
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:22,480
we're gonna draw all the so the set L

1064
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:30,040
our lines are going to be all the lines

1065
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:30,040
through X with a slope in D.

1066
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,040
And when we just look at this cell,

1067
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:43,799
we're still doing the projections in all

1068
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,799
the same directions. We have the same D.

1069
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,119
Um,

1070
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,480
okay. Yeah, let me write down our so D.

1071
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:55,280
So, DI is the same as D.

1072
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:58,839
Okay. And then, um, we have a a double

1073
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,839
counting observation.

1074
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,000
And the double counting observation says

1075
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,680
that if the number of directions is

1076
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,240
bigger than the number of points, maybe

1077
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:14,720
twice the number of points,

1078
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:17,040
um, then s should be at least around the

1079
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,200
number of points.

1080
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,000
And the reason for that is that if you

1081
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,440
have this many directions

1082
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,680
and a typical point

1083
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,440
for most of the directions you're

1084
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,319
projecting it cannot hit any other

1085
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,960
point. So in most directions when you

1086
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:37,520
project a point. So we have this point

1087
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,440
we have a handful of other points but

1088
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,240
then we're going to project this point

1089
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,040
in many directions.

1090
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,040
So there

1091
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,680
okay so we have let's say we have more

1092
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,920
than twice as many directions as points

1093
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,280
if I draw a lines in different in these

1094
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,440
different directions through my base

1095
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,400
point most of those lines won't hit any

1096
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,240
other point so when I look at this

1097
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,880
projection this will be the only point

1098
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,880
over here and so in this situation

1099
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,400
most of the time um the points don't

1100
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,400
land on top of each other when you do

1101
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,240
projections. And so this size of the

1102
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,720
projection is around the same as the

1103
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,720
size of the set.

1104
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,240
Okay.

1105
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,240
Um

1106
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,119
okay, great. So now L are all of the

1107
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,920
lines that go through X with slope in D.

1108
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:41,000
And each line only goes through a small

1109
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,000
fraction of the cells. So,

1110
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:53,520
so

1111
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:56,480
um so LI, so LI would be the lines

1112
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:00,319
that go through OI and for a typical

1113
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:03,200
cell li would be smaller than L over

1114
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:06,960
sigma.

1115
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:09,440
So now what we do is we cut up our

1116
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,000
picture into small enough cells that in

1117
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,960
each cell the number of directions is

1118
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,960
bigger than the number of points.

1119
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:22,799
So we choose sigma

1120
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:27,559
so that x over sigma squared is smaller

1121
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:27,559
than half of the number of directions.

1122
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:35,200
Um

1123
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:41,480
and so then we get that si is bigger

1124
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,480
than xi which is x over sigma squ.

1125
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:49,880
Um okay and from that we can compute um

1126
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,079
um

1127
00:59:53,839 --> 01:00:01,280
so I say this so s

1128
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,480
* d is the number of lines

1129
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:08,000
and that's bigger than sigma times the

1130
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,319
number of lines through a typical cell

1131
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,799
which is like sigma time the number of

1132
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,799
directions times the size of a

1133
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:17,520
projection for a particular cell. So

1134
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:20,319
then in in each cell the number of lines

1135
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:23,200
is the number of directions times the

1136
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:28,559
size of a projection.

1137
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:34,240
Uh okay. And SI is bigger than XI.

1138
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:37,359
So that's bigger than sigma * D * um X

1139
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:42,720
over sigma^ 2.

1140
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:45,839
That's X * D / sigma.

1141
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:50,440
and sigma is dictated here.

1142
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:50,440
So if you plug in the value of sigma,

1143
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:58,079
you get that this is x to the 12 d to

1144
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:02,599
the three halves and you cancel the d's

1145
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,599
and and that's the lower bound.

1146
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,720
Okay.

1147
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,559
So algebra aside, what is happening is

1148
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,480
that we do this cell decomposition and

1149
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,200
we cut things up finely enough so that

1150
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,720
within this cell the number of

1151
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,839
directions is bigger than the number of

1152
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,480
points in this cell. Then we know that a

1153
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:28,400
typical line only goes through one point

1154
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,359
and then we count everything up and some

1155
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,000
ready troder falls out.

1156
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:37,559
What goes wrong when we try to do this

1157
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,559
for unit bus?

1158
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:41,280
[Applause]

1159
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,559
All right.

1160
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,480
So if the set X has an alpha dimensional

1161
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,079
spacing condition, then you should

1162
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,799
visualize it as being something like a

1163
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:55,920
caner set. So I tried to draw that here.

1164
01:01:52,799 --> 01:02:00,040
So now we can partition it.

1165
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,040
We do our cell decomposition.

1166
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,799
we have sigma squared cells. Sigma is a

1167
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,960
parameter.

1168
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:14,119
So x i is x intersected with oi. So here

1169
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,119
it is.

1170
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,920
And um well we'd like to think of this

1171
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,040
as a smaller version of our original

1172
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:27,440
problem. And our original problem was

1173
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:30,799
about unit balls in a bigger ball. So

1174
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,839
actually we need to know how big is this

1175
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:36,319
bigger ball.

1176
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:38,799
Let's call it a ball of radius little r.

1177
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:40,799
Now it won't necessarily happen. We

1178
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:43,680
don't know for sure that x i is

1179
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:45,440
organized into one ball like this. But

1180
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,440
that is the that could happen and it's

1181
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,760
the most important case. So let's just

1182
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:53,480
imagine that each of these xis lives in

1183
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,480
one ball like this.

1184
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,720
Okay. Now, we're going to think of this

1185
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:02,000
as a smaller version of our original

1186
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:04,000
problem. In our original problem, we had

1187
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,280
a set of directions and we needed them

1188
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,440
to be one over r separated

1189
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:12,720
because two directions that are too

1190
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,039
close together, they look equivalent.

1191
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:18,240
And now that we have this smaller ball,

1192
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:20,319
our set of directions are not one over

1193
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:24,280
little r separated.

1194
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,280
So, here's the key point.

1195
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:32,160
set of directions is 1 / r separated

1196
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:35,160
but it is not one over little r

1197
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,160
separated.

1198
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,280
All right. So if we if you think of it

1199
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,799
in terms of the fibers of the projection

1200
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:47,440
map you would see some twos.

1201
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:49,680
So maybe that

1202
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,160
maybe this is one of our directions. And

1203
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,000
you see that the there there's a fiber

1204
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,440
that is a tube with a lot of points in

1205
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,520
it. And maybe there's another direction

1206
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,680
in our projection

1207
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:05,119
um

1208
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:08,240
that looks something like that.

1209
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,400
This is a different noticeably different

1210
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,559
direction if you're looking at the big

1211
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,520
ball and it has a different set of

1212
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:19,680
points in it. But if you're looking just

1213
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,960
within this cell, these two tubes or

1214
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,960
these two directions are

1215
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,960
indistinguishable.

1216
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,400
Okay.

1217
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,119
So, in order to

1218
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,119
study our original problem, in order to

1219
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,720
study what's going on within this cell,

1220
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,319
we can't really use all of these

1221
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:42,280
directions. We only have to we have to

1222
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:42,280
use the inequivalent ones.

1223
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:49,359
So d

1224
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:52,079
is um let's say

1225
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:55,440
d so

1226
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:59,359
let's say that theta 1 is equivalent to

1227
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:04,240
theta 2 if theta 1 minus theta 2 is less

1228
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:06,799
than 1 / r and then d is going to be d

1229
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,160
up to equivalence.

1230
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:10,400
This is not exactly an equivalence

1231
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,400
relation, but anyway, we we pick a

1232
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,520
subset of the directions so that there's

1233
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,200
only one of them in each one over R arc.

1234
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,960
Maybe it's better to say that. Let me

1235
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,440
see.

1236
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,440
So we choose

1237
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:29,760
di inside of D.

1238
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:31,359
So that um

1239
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:36,000
uh

1240
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:37,599
so that DI intersect an arc smaller than

1241
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,119
one

1242
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:44,920
for each arc gamma in the circle of

1243
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,920
length 1 / R.

1244
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,160
And now we have a smaller set of

1245
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,160
directions.

1246
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,200
Okay.

1247
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,240
Okay. So, double counting

1248
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:15,400
double counting still helps still uh uh

1249
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,400
works well.

1250
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:21,359
If it were to happen that DI

1251
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,359
was bigger than

1252
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,359
Xi,

1253
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:32,000
that's still true, just like before.

1254
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,559
But the key difference between the

1255
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,280
original problem and this version with

1256
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,440
um unit balls is that in the original

1257
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,400
problem when we looked at a smaller

1258
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,720
piece of it in the cell oi we had many

1259
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,440
fewer points but we still had the same

1260
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,960
number of directions. So if the cell was

1261
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,400
small enough the number of points in the

1262
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,839
cell would drop below the number of

1263
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,240
directions and then double counting

1264
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:57,599
would give a very good bound.

1265
01:06:54,240 --> 01:07:01,440
But now when I go into a smaller cell, I

1266
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:03,119
have fewer points, but I also have fewer

1267
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,119
directions.

1268
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,680
And so it's not clear whether I'm making

1269
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,039
any progress.

1270
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,319
Um to check whether you're making

1271
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,960
progress, you have to write down

1272
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:16,559
carefully how these things are changing.

1273
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,160
Um and um I won't do the whole

1274
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,920
computation, but I will tell you what

1275
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:24,799
happens.

1276
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:30,480
So if x and d are housedorf

1277
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:35,520
and uh so x is r to the alpha so x is

1278
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:37,839
alpha dimensional and d is r to the beta

1279
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:41,520
d is beta dimensional then what you'll

1280
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:44,160
find is that x i is little r to the

1281
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,160
alpha so the radius little r would

1282
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,760
depend on how much we chop things up. If

1283
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,440
I take a finer cell decomposition,

1284
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,880
little r will get smaller. So it's

1285
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,000
essentially a free parameter that I can

1286
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:57,359
choose. Xi will be like little r to the

1287
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,359
alpha and d will be little r to the

1288
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,359
beta.

1289
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,680
So if alpha was bigger than beta

1290
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,880
initially, so I had many more points

1291
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,280
than directions, which is the

1292
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,920
interesting case. After I look at a

1293
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,359
smaller cell, alpha will still be bigger

1294
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,920
than beta. So I still have many more

1295
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,920
points than directions.

1296
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:26,279
Um so I won't ever get to a place where

1297
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,279
I can apply this double counting.

1298
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:40,319
Okay. Now having said that I think there

1299
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:42,400
are some situations where where this

1300
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,319
method would give something new and

1301
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:48,799
interesting. Uh so in particular

1302
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,279
when we did this computation

1303
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:54,000
it was predicated on having equalities

1304
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,560
here

1305
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,719
and if we had strong inequalities here

1306
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,359
then something more favorable would

1307
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:04,640
happen and we might get uh an

1308
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,319
interesting estimate.

1309
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,520
I don't think this has ever been written

1310
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,199
down carefully. So Tom Wolf tried really

1311
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,719
hard to understand this and I'm sure he

1312
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,239
thought through everything that I just

1313
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,560
presented

1314
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:19,199
but I guess the answers didn't turn out

1315
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,600
sufficiently sort of positive for him to

1316
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,359
write it up as a paper and I don't think

1317
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,159
anyone else has really systematically

1318
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,920
done it. So also it could be a good

1319
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:31,880
project to see how much does cell

1320
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,880
decomposition tell us.

1321
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:41,600
Okay. Now there is also an example

1322
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:44,400
that's worth mentioning um why being

1323
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,920
able to cut things into pieces

1324
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:50,000
um

1325
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:53,839
that doesn't necessarily let us

1326
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,760
I should say okay so so this was so okay

1327
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,360
so there's also an example that matches

1328
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,000
the story that I was just telling about

1329
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,840
how this proof would go um and the

1330
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
example goes back to the beginning of

1331
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,600
the class when we were noticing when we

1332
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,400
were doing projection theory in finite

1333
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,159
fields

1334
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,400
that it makes a difference whether you

1335
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:13,199
have a prime field or whether you have a

1336
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,840
field with sub fields and that is also

1337
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,760
true for um for this problem that's on

1338
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:21,040
the board here. It's different over the

1339
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,120
real numbers versus the complex numbers

1340
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,840
because the complex numbers have a nice

1341
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,360
sub field the real numbers.

1342
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,560
So let me end by mentioning that

1343
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:33,549
example.

1344
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,549
[Applause]

1345
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,040
Are there actually are there any

1346
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,600
questions or comments before I before I

1347
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,600
do that last example?

1348
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,000
Okay.

1349
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,280
So end the class. I'll mention this

1350
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,280
example over the complex numbers.

1351
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:20,800
Okay. So in this setup, X is a set of

1352
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:26,520
unit balls

1353
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,520
in the ball of radius R in C2.

1354
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,120
Um so

1355
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:36,480
this ball you can think of C2 for the

1356
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,000
moment as being R4. So this ball has a

1357
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,280
volume

1358
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,960
which is like R 4th.

1359
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,040
Okay. Now we're going to consider some

1360
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:52,560
projections and I think a good way to

1361
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:57,040
write it is pi t of z1 z2 is z1 + t z2.

1362
01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:00,000
So in this story z1 and z2 and t are all

1363
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,000
complex numbers. So these are complex

1364
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,400
projections and they're parameterized by

1365
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,600
a complex number t which maybe we can

1366
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:10,480
think of as being in the unit ball. So d

1367
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,280
is contained in the unit ball in the

1368
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:17,880
space of complex numbers

1369
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,880
and it's 1 / r separated.

1370
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:29,920
Okay. And then we can define sxd and nxr

1371
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:32,400
and nd row and housedorf.

1372
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,320
As usual,

1373
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,920
all those definitions translate in a

1374
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,920
straightforward way to the complex

1375
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,920
setting.

1376
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:45,360
Okay. And now the example basically is

1377
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:47,840
that the set X is basically R2 the real

1378
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:52,000
points and the set of directions are

1379
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:54,000
going to be the real directions.

1380
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,520
So

1381
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,080
X is a set of unit balls

1382
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,320
with centers

1383
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,679
in R2

1384
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,640
and they're sitting in the ball of

1385
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:09,920
radius R. So the size of X would be like

1386
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,480
R 2

1387
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,040
R 2 kind of real balls among R to the

1388
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:17,280
4th complex balls.

1389
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:20,880
And our set of directions are going to

1390
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:23,199
be um is going to be contained in the

1391
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,880
real part of the ball and they're one

1392
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:28,920
over r separated. So our set of

1393
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,920
directions will have size r.

1394
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:35,520
Okay. So now if I take a real point z1

1395
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,679
z1 and z2 are real and I take a real

1396
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,600
projection so t is real then that will

1397
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,120
be real.

1398
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,719
So the um all of the projections of all

1399
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,960
of the centers of the balls will be

1400
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,159
real. The balls are still complex so

1401
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,280
they stick out a little bit in the

1402
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:53,440
imaginary direction but not very much.

1403
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,880
So if I take

1404
01:13:53,440 --> 01:14:00,560
uh so if t is in d

1405
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:03,520
and I take pi t of x, what does it look

1406
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:07,520
like? Here's the complex plane. Here's a

1407
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:11,400
ball of radius R and

1408
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,400
it will look like this.

1409
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:18,719
And this height will only be one because

1410
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:23,159
this will consist of lots of unit balls

1411
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:23,159
whose centers are real.

1412
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:30,600
So we can conclude that S of XD is

1413
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,600
around R.

1414
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,199
Okay, so this example badly violates

1415
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,080
this conjecture showing that the

1416
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:42,560
conjecture is not true over the complex

1417
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,920
numbers.

1418
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,840
Um, and this example

1419
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,120
so and you know we had some simpler

1420
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,120
things that we did know how to prove

1421
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,040
over the reals. Uh, we had double

1422
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,960
counting and we had the forier method.

1423
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,640
Those work over the complex numbers and

1424
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,719
this example is sharp for both of those

1425
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,480
things.

1426
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:04,000
Um

1427
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:06,320
and um in this example you do kind of

1428
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
have so so you could ask you know are

1429
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,800
there cell decompositions over the

1430
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,760
complex numbers? It's a slightly tricky

1431
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,920
question. Um you know the way we built

1432
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,440
cell decompositions did look special for

1433
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:22,080
the real numbers because we took a

1434
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,080
variety a real a real you know the zero

1435
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,880
set of a polinomial and cut it out and

1436
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,400
that decomposed space into pieces. And

1437
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,960
here we're working over the complex

1438
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,800
numbers. If you take the zero set of a

1439
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,360
complex polomial and cut it out, it does

1440
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,120
not divide space into pieces. If you

1441
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,560
take the zero set of a real polinomial

1442
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,320
and cut it out, it does divide space

1443
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,440
into pieces, but it doesn't necessarily

1444
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,960
interact well with complex projections.

1445
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:48,000
Um,

1446
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,880
but in spite of that, there is with work

1447
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,440
a decent cell decomposition theory over

1448
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,679
C. And the main thing is that it's easy

1449
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:57,520
to see that for this particular example,

1450
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:59,840
you could divide it into pieces in a

1451
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,600
nice way by hand and the pieces would

1452
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,080
have all the properties of the cell

1453
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,520
decomposition uh that that you would

1454
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:10,960
that you would have in R2.

1455
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:13,440
Okay. So that goes to show that even

1456
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,440
even though this theorem looks a lot

1457
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,679
like the semi troder theorem and we have

1458
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,280
a proof of the semi troder theorem,

1459
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:22,239
we're going to need to approach this

1460
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:27,000
theorem very differently.

1461
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:27,000
because the cell decomposition method

1462
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,560
applies equally well to this example

1463
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,920
which is a counter example too you know

1464
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,600
which is which does not match our

1465
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,239
theorem.

1466
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,920
Um so to make progress towards this we

1467
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:41,840
have to think about the issue of whether

1468
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,719
a seal field field has sub fields and

1469
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:47,440
things like that um and try to take

1470
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:51,719
advantage of that to improve the bounds

1471
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,719
over over something like this.
