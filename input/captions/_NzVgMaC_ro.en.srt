1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone. Good afternoon. Uh my

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,400
name is Yael Weiss. I'm the CEO of a

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
company by the name of Mazi Therapeutics

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
and I'm here to introduce the speakers

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
of the next session. You guys have an

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,320
advantage over me because you probably

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,039
know the speakers better than I do. So I

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,720
decided to go beyond the small intros

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,519
that I got and look at people on the

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,560
online. And Nile, Dr. Nile Lennon, he uh

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,920
is obviously the dawn of the labs here

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
at the Broad. He needs no additional int

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,440
introduction, but can I see your hands?

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
Can you go like this, please? So, I

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
looked him up and his ex profile, he is

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,320
holding his hands like this. Now,

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,440
there's nothing on them, but it says

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,559
science rules,

19
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,879
right? He hasn't posted since

20
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:54,079
2021. So, that's that's actually a plus,

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,480
but that's what his profile shows. So,

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,960
science rules, guys. Dr. Nile Lennon.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,960
Oh, thank you.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,879
All right. Um, thanks for that intro.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
That's great. I didn't even know I still

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,880
had a profile, so maybe should delete

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,479
that. Um, all right. Uh, so this is

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,080
going to be very different than probably

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,080
the last couple of talks. I'm not really

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
going to talk

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,840
about specific sort of biological

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,439
disease stories, per se. This is really

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,520
kind of technology nerd update. Um and

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,280
and maybe just for folks who may be new

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,119
or maybe come in from out out of town,

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,439
just to kind of say a little bit of

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,520
background. Um first of all, what's this

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,200
logo? Who is this group? Why have I got

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,159
the wrong clicker?

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,920
Um do I have the wrong

41
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,439
clicker? Do you have the other clicker?

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,840
You're bringing it home. You got the

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,079
right clicker. All

44
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,759
right. Gotcha.

45
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,720
Perfect. Hey, it worked. All right. Um

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,240
we'll hide this one. All right. Um so

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,520
just in case you haven't sort of you

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,240
know been here for 20 years like I have

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
um you may be more familiar with a group

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,320
called broad genomics platform and so

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,000
that essentially has been the group that

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,759
operates the sequencing technologies at

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,640
the broad institute um since its its

54
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,319
formation I mean it was called other

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,879
things it was sequencing platform but

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,879
basically where the big sequencers live

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,000
um that's the broad genomics platform

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,720
about 10 years ago um actually you know

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,040
David Uler was the executive sponsor and

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,040
I led a project to build a clinical lab

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,400
at the broad. So that is essentially a

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,000
clea certified um entity that allows us

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,760
to do testing under clea regulations for

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,160
projects that want to be in that

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
translational space maybe as a research

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,000
study but want to do return of results.

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,599
Maybe is a clinical trial but wants to

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
be able to have an auditable quality

69
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,160
system or actually wants to do

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,720
diagnostics. And so we created a new

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,000
entity back in the day. It had a

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,959
different name to begin with. I won't

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
even say it. It was unhelpful. Um uh but

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,200
it's a wholly owned LLC of the Broad

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,080
Institute that that operates our

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,640
clinical um license. Now it's called

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
Broad Clinical Labs. Um and our lab

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,800
director is Heidi Rem, who most of you

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,239
will probably know. Um so for all

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
intents and purposes, you can think of

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,800
the two things synonymously. Broad

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,400
Clinical Labs doesn't have any

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,800
employees. It's essentially Bro Genomics

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,400
platform, but Broad Clinical Labs is the

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,400
entity through which we do two things.

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,480
One is any clinical work that's

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,400
regulated um and two any external work.

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,720
So if a pharma company wants to work

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,560
with um us for you know genomics project

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,440
they actually contract with broad

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,959
clinical labs um even if they're doing

92
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,000
research work. So it's just sort of it's

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,680
our external facing um sort of brand to

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
the world. But for all intents and

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
purposes, if you're at the broad or in

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,319
the broad community, it's the same

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,440
group. All right. Um Oh, something has

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,319
changed. So, you know, um when I joined

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,400
20 years ago, um the sequencing group uh

100
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,480
was a few blocks from here in 320

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,159
Charles Street in that lovely old

102
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,280
building that housed the sort of human

103
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,920
genome project uh labs. Um we are no

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,040
longer there. We have moved all the way

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,480
out over here to Burlington,

106
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,320
Massachusetts. Um, which is about 14

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,079
miles from here. Um, um, so for most of

108
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,600
you that isn't a big deal. It doesn't

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,360
really make too much difference to you.

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,639
Um, this little green circle is where I

111
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,560
live. Um, so it's actually exactly the

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,080
same distance, but to drive to Kendall

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
Square it takes me 45 minutes and to

114
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,600
drive to Burlington takes me 15 minutes.

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,919
So for me, it's an improvement in

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
quality of life. Um, it's actually an

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
improvement for quality of life for the

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
people who work there, too. We actually

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,639
built an entirely new building from the

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,759
ground up. Uh, it's a beautiful

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,720
building, 145,000 square feet of new lab

122
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,040
space, customdesigned for a sort of

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,199
modern genomic center and clinical

124
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,880
testing laboratory. And we have about

125
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,320
200 people who work out there. And so,

126
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,639
if you're ever in the Burlington area,

127
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,919
please feel free to uh swing by. It's

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,520
like any other broad building. You can

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,160
come in, you can find a hotel space, you

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,240
can work. We have 40 meeting rooms that

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,680
are not booked most of the time. Um,

132
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,199
so anyway, so that's where we're at if

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,759
you're ever looking for us. Um, but I

134
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,680
also want to point out that now rather

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
than sort of just running sequencers, we

136
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,960
actually do quite a lot of things under

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,039
the umbrella of um, GP and and BCL. Um

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,120
so obviously we run a lot of sort of the

139
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,560
you know genomic assays that many people

140
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,720
will use um genomes and exoms and RNA

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,479
and you know single cell sequencing and

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
all that kind of stuff and we have

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,800
versions of those things that have been

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280
validated for clinical use as well. Um

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,280
we we run microbial whole genome we have

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,639
you know we have all sorts of fun stuff.

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,199
Um but we've also now got um things like

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,320
um patient engagement um capabilities.

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,759
So the count mein group which was uh you

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,039
know for folks who've been here a long

151
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,039
time originally um sort of initiated by

152
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,080
um um Nick Waglay and then and Corey

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,600
Painter as a way to enroll directly

154
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,199
enroll participants into uh research uh

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,039
and then became sort of its own sort of

156
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880
spinout entity from the broad has kind

157
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:18,120
of rejoined the broad and now sits

158
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,319
within uh the GPCL uh group um

159
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,080
and so and I'll talk a little bit more

160
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
about that in a Second, we also have

161
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
things like, you know, if you have a

162
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,440
research study where you actually want

163
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,360
to directly enroll participants, we can

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,199
directly send saliva kits to people's

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,440
homes and receive them back. And so we

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,360
have thing capabilities like that. Now

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,319
um we also have if you if you work in

168
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,319
the Kendall campus um the um molecular

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,280
development lab MDL methods development

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,120
lab MDL uh run by Aziz Alavage and

171
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,759
that's sort of like hardcore molecular

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,639
R&D type work. And so many folks work

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,560
with Aziz's team on sort of, you know,

174
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,880
novel methods if you need to sort of

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
figure out, you know, ways to construct

176
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,160
things. So they work sequencing wise if

177
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,960
you're interested in isoforms. There's

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,720
lots of things that Aziz's team works

179
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,080
on. And they sit on this campus, but

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,680
they're part of the GPCL um group. And

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,039
uh recently just at the end of last year

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,919
we also um uh brought in uh Victoria

183
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,319
Puppik who is um a Schmidt fellow who

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,520
now leads our computational R&D team as

185
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,280
well and so she's really um developing a

186
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,440
lot of sort of machine learning methods

187
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,360
in um you know things like calling

188
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,039
structure variation and other uh things

189
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
as well. So we have that capability as

190
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,680
well. And sort of a new thing that sort

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
of hasn't been sort of fully formally

192
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,199
rolled out yet, but some people know

193
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
about is we are actually starting to

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,319
build out cell services um cell factory

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,000
services. And so that means now you know

196
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,919
we've actually stood up um cell culture

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,520
and the ability to do very large scale

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,120
cell um processing at in Burlington. And

199
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
this is really in service of what you've

200
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,039
been hearing sort of the you know

201
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,319
massive explosion of this idea of using

202
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,280
perturb seek and other um methods to do

203
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,120
largecale discovery uh in cells and we

204
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,960
see that as a very very large growing

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
area. There's programs of the cell.

206
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,440
There's a whole bunch of people now

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,680
planning out very large cell programs.

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
And so we're moving from individual

209
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,039
experiments which are sort of hundreds

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,800
of thousands to millions of cells into

211
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,720
billions of cells. And that's something

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
that a platform is really set up to

213
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
actually do really well. And so we're

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,879
we're actually just kicking that off

215
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,039
now. And so that's going to be an

216
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,000
exciting area in the next few years. All

217
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,240
right. Uh just on the CMI just for for

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,279
rare diseases specifically, it can be

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,599
useful. So having knowhow a team who's

220
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,120
been doing it for years uh independently

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,360
but um how to actually set up studies

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
how to develop enrollment strategies to

223
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,920
actually then operate those outreach and

224
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,160
enrollment to have software to support

225
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,399
online consent and enrollment into into

226
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
studies the backend infrastructure to

227
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,160
send out kits for sample collection

228
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,920
directly to patients and participants.

229
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,839
have those come back have your your

230
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,839
molecular data generated and then

231
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
submitted to whatever cloud environment

232
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,360
you're actually going to do your

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,360
analysis in. So this has of course

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
powered uh many of the projects that me

235
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,399
people know there's been over 20 studies

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,480
done at um with the count me in group

237
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,440
including the rare gems project at

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,440
project angio saroma many rare cancer

239
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
projects as well so this idea of

240
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
connecting people directly allowing

241
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,000
people to enroll around the country into

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,480
these studies is very powerful and and

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,800
we're working really hard to try this

244
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,880
into like a sustainable sort of uh

245
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,399
business model that we can that we can

246
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,720
run and offer offer to people to come

247
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,480
work to work with us. So, we're not

248
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
just, you know, send us your DNA and

249
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
we'll take it from there, but like help

250
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,519
us enroll the actual community that you

251
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,600
need um to power your study. All right.

252
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,720
Um so, just to get technical and nerdy

253
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
then for a little bit, there's going to

254
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
be a couple of updates that you you may

255
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
not care about or you may not think

256
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
about a whole lot, but I wanted to let

257
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,360
you know what's been happening in

258
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
genomics technology over the last six

259
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,440
months to nine months, just so you're

260
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,320
all aware. um uh lots of things use

261
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,920
short read sequencing. So you know you

262
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
again oh I should I didn't mention in

263
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,959
the other slide. So the bro technology

264
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
space is also part of um GPB um BCL and

265
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,959
that's for groups you know on main

266
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
campus who want to walk up and use a

267
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,880
benchtop sequencer there's tons of

268
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,440
technology in Trish's space at the broad

269
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,680
technology space um and that's another

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,360
um sort of service for the group. If you

271
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,959
need the big big sequencers or you need

272
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,800
like the highest amount of data for the

273
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,160
lowest amount of cost those are the

274
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,160
things we actually operate out in

275
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
Burlington. The latest version of those

276
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,680
for Aluminina if you're if you're

277
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,480
interested is the Nova X. Uh we have

278
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,000
like 15 of them. Um so we run them a

279
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,920
lot. Um we did a 100,000 genomes last

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,600
year. Um I think a week ago we crossed

281
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,920
750,000 human whole genomes done over

282
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,200
all time. Um so we have a lot of

283
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,640
capacity to sequence. Um now um so the

284
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
one thing about these machines allows us

285
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,240
to keep trying to push that cost down.

286
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,600
So it makes it feasible to do whole

287
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,680
genome sequencing. um and continuing to

288
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
support all kinds of input uh materials

289
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
for those. So hopefully, you know, the

290
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,480
path of genome sequencing costs going

291
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,240
down will continue. Although I will note

292
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
that companies like Aluminina have

293
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,720
started issuing notices to saying

294
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,360
because of tariffs, we're increasing our

295
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,920
prices. So hopefully that'll change next

296
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,040
week because that's about the new cycle.

297
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,880
So all right,

298
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,680
um Dragon. So if you care about data

299
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,640
processing and secondary analysis um you

300
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,560
may be surprised that as a default we

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
actually give people who do whole genome

302
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,200
and exo sequencing with us dragon align

303
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,760
data. So this is a a company that was

304
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,600
purchased by aluminina and is now

305
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,720
integrated into their sequencers but

306
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,760
also as standalone servers. Um we've

307
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
partnered with them and had a

308
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,680
collaboration agreement with them for

309
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
many years. So if you send samples for

310
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,560
sort of default genome exom sequencing,

311
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,200
you'll get this dragon 3.7.8 aligned

312
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
data. Most you may not care about that.

313
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
The reason it's that version is that's

314
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
the version we all collectively lock

315
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,800
down on for the all of us research

316
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,720
cohort. So the 500,000 genomes or so

317
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
that are in the all of us data set are

318
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,720
all aligned with that data with that

319
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
version of the aligner. And so that's

320
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,279
sort of the default research version

321
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,160
today just so people can if they want

322
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,839
and are able to do sort of co-analysis.

323
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,040
At some point hopefully somebody will

324
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,120
solve the problem of alignment version

325
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,399
specific joint calling and then we won't

326
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
have to worry about what version we're

327
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,279
running but right now we do. Um I will

328
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,800
point out that if you send a sample for

329
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
a clinical whole genome you actually get

330
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
a very different output from the

331
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,760
secondary analysis pipeline. It's a

332
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,760
later version of the Dragon 436. Um, and

333
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,160
what that means actually for those users

334
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,720
who do get that is that we've been sort

335
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,639
of diligently working away at validating

336
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
the outputs from secondary analysis so

337
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,639
that they can be used in clinical

338
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,480
research and for clinical reporting. So

339
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,040
from our clinical genome today obviously

340
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,760
short variants but also CNVs and SVS

341
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,000
certain types are validated. We've also

342
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,600
um done the sequencing and are in

343
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,240
process of writing up the validation for

344
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,079
repeat expansions, specific repeat

345
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,839
expansions. We've got um SMN calling

346
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,040
validated and we're working through the

347
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,800
other um difficult genes. Um so Dragon

348
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,600
and the Luminina team and us have been

349
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,000
collaborating on sourcing clinical

350
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,720
specimens and running them and modifying

351
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,720
the methods to improve their ability to

352
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,040
um call in these um traditionally

353
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,480
difficult genes um that are clinically

354
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,839
meaningful. And so there's a host of

355
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
those that we're sort of working our way

356
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,440
down through. We also you also get PGX

357
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,120
um star al calling um out from the data

358
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
as well, although we don't include that

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,800
in our clinical reports today. So

360
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,360
contact us if you're interested in

361
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,279
different types of um secondary

362
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,200
analysis. Um blended genome exom is

363
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,040
something that we developed with um Ben

364
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,800
Neil's team and the Stanley Center for

365
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,360
their large scale GIWAS studies. Um it's

366
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,240
a lowcost uh version. It combines

367
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,240
basically exoms and low passhold genome.

368
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
So if you want to do rare variant

369
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,360
monogenic discovery in the exom region,

370
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,560
but you also want to do essentially

371
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,560
imputation um across the rest of the

372
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,279
genome, it's a it's a good balance

373
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,360
between sort of um performance and cost.

374
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,720
So for research purposes, if you have a

375
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
large scale study at the broad, it's

376
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,399
like a $99 assay. So it really replaces

377
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,199
what you might have done with a

378
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,120
genotyping array and a and an exo in the

379
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,959
past, but it has the benefit of not

380
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,680
being essentially biased to the content

381
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,279
of a genotyping array. Um, and now we've

382
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,800
made a clinical version of it. The

383
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,639
clinical version has deeper exome

384
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,560
sequencing. So you have sort of that

385
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,399
typical standard of being able to call

386
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
monogenic variants in the in the coding

387
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,639
region. And we're actually using that

388
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,959
now with partners. Um so um MGB Matt

389
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,680
Lebo's team at MGB in the in LAR from

390
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,160
molecular medicine just launched a a

391
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,199
suite of uh polygenic risk scores um

392
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,279
developed by Praep's um team um using

393
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
the clinical BGE as the data source

394
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,760
behind it. We are also directly doing a

395
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,560
clinical trial with Jason Vassie and the

396
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,440
and the Boston VA on prostate cancer

397
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,480
risk um where again you can look at pro

398
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,320
known prostate um cancer monogenic risk

399
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
in the coding region and then from the

400
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,120
low pass we do an imputation on a a

401
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
prostate um polygenic risk score that

402
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,839
was developed in the million veterans um

403
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,000
program and validated in the all of us

404
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,600
um data

405
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,040
set. All right, completely different.

406
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
Um, so you may or may not have heard

407
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,240
about this. Um, it was mentioned at at

408
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,040
ASG last year. Um, so this is an

409
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,399
aluminina, a new aluminina prep type.

410
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,560
They called it constellation, the

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,199
marketing name constellation. Um, but

412
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,760
essentially what it is, it's a way to

413
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:48,480
create linked read data from short

414
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,959
reads. So not long read data, but

415
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,480
spatially linked read data from short

416
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,720
reads alone. Um, and the kind of cool

417
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,320
techy part of it is essentially what you

418
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,519
do, you take your DNA, if you have good

419
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,800
quality samples, you can do a high

420
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,880
molecular weight extraction. That'd be

421
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,120
even better. And we actually just like

422
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
load it directly on the flow cell. You

423
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
don't do anything else to it. You don't

424
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,839
fragment it. You don't adapt it. You

425
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
don't do anything. You just load it on

426
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,120
the flow cell. So, for one thing,

427
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
there's no sample prep. So, that's

428
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,440
different and cool. What it actually

429
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,279
means is that on the flow cell, so what

430
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
they've done, it's a tech they had for

431
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,000
many years and they couldn't really

432
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,519
figure out what to do with it, but

433
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
essentially in the wells on the surface

434
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:33,600
of the flow cell, they've essentially

435
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:36,639
modified a um a a tagmentation um enzyme

436
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,880
that if you sort of layer a a DNA, a

437
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,480
molecule on top, you know, I have this

438
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
kind of hungry hippo thing in my head,

439
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,079
like it sort of reaches up, grabs a

440
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
piece of DNA, tagments it, adapts it,

441
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,000
and clusters it inside the inside the

442
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,720
well. It doesn't do anything and so it

443
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
does that um it doesn't do anything else

444
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
different really. So you're still doing

445
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,279
short read sequencing after the fact

446
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,519
after you do cluster generation. But

447
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
what you end up with is actually then

448
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,440
when you look at the data because new

449
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
aluminous flow cells are not a random

450
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,039
lawn of oligos like they used to be.

451
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,280
They're an ordered array of of

452
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,120
essentially sort of wells. You can look

453
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,480
at the read data and then you can look

454
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,360
at the spatially adjacent read data and

455
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,959
say, "Huh, based on mapping, this one is

456
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,120
more likely to have come from the same

457
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,720
molecule that was laying on top than

458
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,280
not, right?" And so you can use that

459
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,280
model to essentially recreate links. And

460
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,079
what it does is means that you can

461
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,200
create now confident sort of phasing and

462
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,200
linking of of short read data into long

463
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,280
read contigs, which really helps with

464
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,799
things like mapping. So if you look at

465
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,760
like clinically meaningful difficult

466
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:43,039
genes like stericylin, PMS2 these other

467
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,559
genes um where just in short reads alone

468
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,960
you would always get this dropout

469
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,880
because of homology when you start using

470
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,520
linked information you could actually

471
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,600
confidently link and place those reads.

472
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,280
So you essentially recover coverage in

473
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,640
these traditionally difficult regions.

474
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,480
So that's kind of cool.

475
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,400
Um um there's a lot more data, a lot

476
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,559
more genes we've looked at, but just to

477
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,320
summarize, if you are if you have sort

478
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,480
of high quality DNA going in and you can

479
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,400
do a high molecule extraction, we can

480
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,200
actually fully phase almost all the

481
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,640
genes um with short read data. That's,

482
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
you know, we never could do that before.

483
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,960
So that's cool. Um and you get these

484
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,320
quite large, um phase blocks. And so

485
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,799
you're actually, you know, you're

486
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,280
getting like

487
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:28,240
um um recreating sort of up to like 40

488
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,960
KB chunks in the genome. So that's um a

489
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
really interesting application. We've

490
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,600
run clinical samples on it from

491
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,200
difficult genes and shown that we can

492
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,120
confidently call them. It doesn't impact

493
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
your short read um performance. Um so

494
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,080
the big thing so it's not commercially

495
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,080
available yet. So we're working through

496
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,160
in a collaboration to like run new

497
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,120
samples through it, understand its its

498
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,640
um utility. Obviously with Victoria's

499
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,799
team, we're collaborating to see how can

500
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,799
we leverage this for better structure

501
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
variant calling from short reads alone.

502
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,960
The one thing we don't know yet is like

503
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,080
what will it end up costing. Um so if

504
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,799
you've been sort of paying attention,

505
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,880
the one thing we can't do right now is

506
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,480
barcode because you've taken your DNA,

507
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,799
you've just loaded it on the flow cell.

508
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,640
So you can't multiplex. So right now the

509
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,799
cost would be whatever the cost of one

510
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,039
lane of sequencing is, which has come

511
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,280
down a lot, but it's still like $2,000.

512
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,640
So that's not great. So Aluma is working

513
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,280
on ways to like figure out what it

514
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,120
actually could cost. So that's um but

515
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,559
it's a really interesting way. It sort

516
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,760
of gets you partially like a lot of the

517
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,160
things you might have traditionally done

518
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,840
long reads for, but not everything. But

519
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,080
so that's one thing that's new that

520
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,160
people might be interested in. Um,

521
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
talking of long reads, you know, PAC

522
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,039
Bio, we still have 10 Revio instruments

523
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,600
that we can run. Um, PAC Bio has least a

524
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,760
new chemistry for those recently. It did

525
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
reduce the input requirements. So,

526
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,080
that's good. That can often be a barrier

527
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,320
to using long reads. Um, increase the

528
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,960
yield. It allows us to lower cost. It's

529
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,400
still two to 3x more than a short read

530
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,840
genome, but they are continuing to sort

531
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,919
of, you know, promise that this cost

532
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,559
will come down and it at some point in

533
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,760
the future could be on par with a short

534
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,520
read genome. So, we'll see. Um, we are

535
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,000
actually doing a clinical validation of

536
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,559
the Revio now and so that we will have a

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,640
clinical grade sort of genome from um,

538
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,640
Revio for those translational studies

539
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,160
for clinical research as well. Um just

540
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,520
on that just to point out one thing

541
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,000
we're doing as a collaboration with PAC

542
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,400
Bio and Wendy and and Alan Begs at

543
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,679
Boston Children's is a study to

544
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,159
understand the impact of doing long

545
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,679
reach sequencing on rare disease cohorts

546
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:40,240
uh within BCH. And so um we've actually

547
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,840
run over 600 um samples from um the

548
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
aggregate sort of consortium within

549
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Boston Children's of rare disease and

550
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,080
orphan diseases um across a range of

551
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,000
different sort of um clinics. Um and you

552
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,679
know some of these are legacy samples

553
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,840
some of them been around for quite a

554
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,080
while. So performance is has been up and

555
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,240
down across the cohort. Um some of them

556
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,240
we were able to get fresh material from.

557
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,960
Um but we've been able to get you know

558
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,080
about over 20x uh genome coverage in

559
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,559
general from all of these cases. Many of

560
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
them are trios. Um almost all of these

561
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,000
will have already had short read

562
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,960
sequencing and you know are still sort

563
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,200
of unsolved and so analysis still

564
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,039
ongoing but the different investigators

565
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,640
have been reporting back and so we're

566
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,080
seeing about a 15% of cases having new

567
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,720
findings when you look at this long read

568
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,760
data as well. So, so we'll see, you

569
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,320
know, this uh is

570
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,240
15% good. Is it good enough to justify

571
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,640
doing long reach sequencing on on cases

572
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,559
like this? Um, and you know, how that

573
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,799
all will all play out um when

574
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,280
constellation comes out, we'll see. But

575
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,159
this has been uh really good to at least

576
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,039
get new data to uh Boston Children's.

577
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,919
All right. Um, quickly, last one or two

578
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,280
slides. Um you may have heard about this

579
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,679
uh announcement uh earlier this year. Uh

580
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,840
RO um the giant pharma company and

581
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,000
diagnostics company has been investing

582
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,840
for actually has had internally for many

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,480
many years a program to develop a

584
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,799
sequencer and they finally launched it

585
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,039
or at least announced it um earlier this

586
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,080
year. It's the um sequencing by

587
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,440
expansion um method. And without going

588
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,600
into the technical details, there's a

589
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,200
preprint and stuff with a lot of detail

590
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,440
if you want to go into it. It's kind of

591
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,440
interesting. It's a nanopore sequencer

592
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,760
or at least the detection module is a

593
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,559
nanopore. Um, but the big difference is

594
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,240
in how they do essentially the prep and

595
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,640
I kind of like to call it the pool

596
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,600
noodle method. And so what they do is

597
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,720
essentially they have a expandimemer

598
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,640
um chemistry which takes your DNA

599
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,799
template and essentially for every

600
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,440
nucleotide labels it with these really

601
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,200
large macroolelecules and then allows

602
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,039
you after you've labeled it to cleave it

603
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,559
such that essentially you break the

604
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,640
nucleotide bonds but you've got in

605
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,559
between them these giant pool noodles.

606
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,919
And so the point being when you run

607
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,080
something through something through a

608
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,440
nanopore it goes really quickly. And so

609
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,760
most of the error modes in nanopore

610
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,720
sequencing come from the the rate of

611
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,400
sort of things transver traversing the

612
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,880
pore and the signal being so small from

613
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
nucleotides which are really small. But

614
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,400
pushing pool noodles through the

615
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,120
nanopore is a really big signal. And so

616
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,440
it actually allows you to get much

617
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,840
better signal to noise and and then

618
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,440
recapitulate that. So um so what they've

619
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,960
built is a system to actually leverage

620
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,840
this um which is like a lot of

621
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,640
complicated chemistry to make it work um

622
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,080
but it's massively fast and so you can

623
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,559
do a rapid duplex um run and get about

624
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,400
600 gigabases in one hour which is four

625
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,000
times faster than we can get on the Nova

626
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,080
X and and so and to put that in context

627
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,240
like the actual like if you just did had

628
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,559
a library ready to go it's about 20

629
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,480
minutes of sequencing time for a whole

630
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:56,159
human genome. um for 30x like that's

631
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,200
kind of crazy. Um we've been testing it

632
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,919
uh as a fast clinical um option for

633
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,000
sequencing and we've been able to get a

634
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,000
trio analysis done sample two variants

635
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,320
in seven hours from everything from

636
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,640
sample collection to variance in about

637
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,799
seven hours. And so obviously we're

638
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,360
really interested in where this can go.

639
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,080
Um, we've also been doing some some work

640
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,320
on on what could this mean for single

641
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,840
cell work. Like it produces a tremendous

642
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,520
amount of data. So that's a very new

643
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,799
technology. Um, and we'll, you know, be

644
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,159
collaborating with them over the next

645
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,240
few years as well to see what we could

646
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,240
do with that. All right. Uh, last slide.

647
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
I think just to point out, there's lots

648
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
of other things that I haven't had time

649
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,919
to talk about. Um, there's proteomic

650
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,360
assays that that people are now running.

651
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,360
We're running for the all of us program.

652
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm running for other things to generate

653
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,480
large data sets for uh plasma

654
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,880
proteomics. Um there's also a new RNA

655
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
product um that we've run on 10,000

656
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,440
samples for the all of us program as

657
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,760
well which is a total RNA uh method with

658
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,440
globe and ribosomal depletion that just

659
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,720
gives you a tremendous amount of sort of

660
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,159
um RNA information um and is lower cost

661
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,720
than what we've been doing traditionally

662
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,200
as well. So um I think with that I'm

663
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,960
wrapped up but there's lots of stuff

664
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,000
that we do with the platform. So, if you

665
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,840
ever have any um issues, just email us,

666
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,520
find us, come out to Burlington, visit

667
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,320
us, stop off at the mall, have lunch,

668
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,919
come over. Um and we're we're here to

669
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,000
serve the community. So, please feel

670
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,840
free to reach out to us. Thank you, Dr.

671
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,760
Lennon. Very important in this age of

672
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,080
genetic diagnosis. And I do have some

673
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,679
questions for you for

674
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:38,799
later. So, our next speaker is uh Arya

675
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:43,440
Ralph. Where's Arya? Hi, Arya. Uh Arya

676
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:46,720
um is obviously a very talented MD PhD

677
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,080
candidate in the Batya and Sebetti Lops

678
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,600
and she is the recipient of the

679
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,320
inaugural ladders to cures accelerator

680
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,039
award. She's also a Renaissance woman.

681
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,600
She swims, she plays the saxophone and

682
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:03,039
she sings. So Oh, impressive.

683
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,039
Today she will talk to us about

684
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,440
harnessing cell type specific gene

685
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,360
regulation for targeted gene therapy.

686
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,799
Okay. Thank you so much y'all. Um it's

687
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,000
wonderful to be here and to be with you

688
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,320
all. Um as was mentioned I'm an MD/PhD

689
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,640
candidate uh in the Harvard MIT MD PhD

690
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,640
program uh pursuing joint doctoral work

691
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
between Paris's lab here at the Broad

692
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,440
and Sanga Batia's lab at MIT. Uh and

693
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,080
today I'm excited to share some of our

694
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,640
work towards developing novel cell type

695
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,360
specific gene therapies.

696
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,520
So to start, our genome is composed of

697
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,880
just four bases, A, C, T, and G. And

698
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,960
with different combinations of these

699
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,200
bases, our genomes are able to

700
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,159
accomplish this huge range of functions

701
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,559
needed for our body to

702
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,559
work. But it's interesting uh while

703
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,720
there are tons and tons and tons of

704
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,480
combinations of these four bases,

705
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,000
natural evolution has only explored a

706
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,480
small fraction of these. And we can do

707
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,320
the math to see that that's the case.

708
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,960
For a genome of our size, which is three

709
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,039
billion base pairs long, uh there are

710
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,679
four to the three billionth possible

711
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,200
configurations of a genome of our size.

712
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,880
But looking at the human genome, we

713
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,159
realize that less than 1% of these

714
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,799
configurations have actually been

715
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,080
explored. Uh and so the question is why?

716
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,679
And what's in that missing

717
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,679
code? Evolution works via two key

718
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,320
forces. We have mutation and then we

719
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,720
have selection. As our cells divide

720
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,799
throughout our lifetimes, um, errors or

721
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,960
mutations accumulate, uh, and the

722
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,440
beneficial ones rise to high frequency

723
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,039
via the process of

724
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,360
selection. We can imagine evolution like

725
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,880
a hiker in a mountain range, a step

726
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,760
forward that our hiker takes as a

727
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,480
mutation. Uh, and beneficial mutations

728
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,000
take the hiker higher along the

729
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,080
mountain. But the problem is this. When

730
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,840
our hiker or evolution is standing in

731
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,360
this mountain range, it doesn't know if

732
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,799
that the path that it's on is the one

733
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,640
that's taking it to the highest possible

734
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,640
peak. And so it's easy to just follow

735
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,559
the path and line wind up on something

736
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,279
that's suboptimal, not actually the

737
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,880
highest peak in the region. We can get

738
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,960
stuck on those sub-optimal peaks because

739
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
we can't actually see where we're going.

740
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,559
And so it's for this reason that

741
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,240
evolution has only explored a tiny

742
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,640
fraction of what's possible with the

743
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,880
number of configurations we have. Uh we

744
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
can't see where we're going.

745
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,080
There are many many peaks that are left

746
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,159
to be unexplor left to be explored

747
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,159
though from this unexplored space and so

748
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,760
it's in this uncharted territory that we

749
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,600
might discover new functions for our

750
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,000
genetic code that we haven't found

751
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,760
previously things that we can do that

752
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,039
will give us new options for gene

753
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,039
therapy in this synthetic

754
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,600
DNA while I was a medical student on the

755
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,600
wards at Mass General I was really

756
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,760
fortunate to work with fantastic rare

757
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,120
disease patients and their families and

758
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,960
something that struck me during this

759
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,039
process was that if we could find ways

760
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,039
to more specifically target the cells

761
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,200
that are at risk or diseased in these

762
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,200
cohorts, we might be able to offer more

763
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
promising

764
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,120
therapies. Most of the DNA in our cells

765
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,279
is actually regulatory, turning genes on

766
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,080
and off uh as opposed to coding for

767
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,720
proteins directly. One type of this DNA

768
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,520
called cis regulatory elements or CRE

769
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
are prevalent and we can tune our CRES

770
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,360
to give different levels of gene

771
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,440
expression. Uh give higher levels of

772
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,240
genes uh make our genes active in

773
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,520
specific cell types so on and so forth.

774
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,600
We can learn the rules of this

775
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,120
regulatory DNA and maybe if we can build

776
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,240
around them we can design new

777
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,000
therapies. Achieving this vision for

778
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,679
rare disease therapeutics requires

779
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,919
building the right team and I'm very

780
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,440
fortunate to be part of a great one. Uh

781
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,320
as I mentioned I'm in the SEI lab and

782
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,320
the Batia lab. Um and party sibi's lab

783
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,760
is a computational genomics lab. This is

784
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,720
where we're going to be able to design

785
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,720
the right CRES. Uh Sitabatia's lab

786
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,960
focuses on nanotechnologies and this is

787
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,279
how we can focus on getting our CRE to

788
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,559
the right place. Uh and so together this

789
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,760
is how we can achieve this next

790
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,520
generation of rare disease

791
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,360
therapeutics. Our lab has come up with

792
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,200
ways to design CRES that work in

793
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,480
unprecedented ways. This work has been

794
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,159
led by Sagosai and Rodrigo Castro. Uh we

795
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,399
use an experimental assay called a

796
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,279
massively parallel reporter assay or an

797
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,760
MP to test hundreds of thousands of CR

798
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,679
at once uh empirically. And this allows

799
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,520
us to describe the genome's regulatory

800
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,679
grammar uh just with a simple

801
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,200
experiment. We can use computational

802
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,440
methods to then explore that data

803
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,960
further and design sequences that act

804
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,559
even better than the ones that we find

805
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,880
naturally.

806
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,279
Diving more closely into that method, uh

807
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,159
we start with a DNA library of our

808
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,880
putitive CRES. We tag these on to

809
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,399
fluorescent reporters like a GFP. Uh and

810
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
then we can transfect those into

811
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,919
different cell lines of interest to

812
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,080
obtain activity readouts of the

813
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,799
expression of our reporter. Uh and these

814
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,480
numerical scores can be used to fuel

815
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,919
computational exploration. So the

816
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,039
experiment I've showed here, we did it

817
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,360
in blood, liver, and neuronal cell

818
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,279
lines. Our experimental data can be used

819
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,880
to train machine learning models uh that

820
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,360
learn the regulatory grammar of the

821
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,880
genome. So we can hone in on what parts

822
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,279
of the DNA sequences are actually

823
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,440
contributing to DNA activity. Here we

824
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,039
can explore why a certain CR might be

825
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,200
cell type specific, why one might be

826
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,880
more active, uh and how we might be able

827
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,360
to modify these sequences to gain

828
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,880
functional advantages going forward. So

829
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,480
our predictive machine learning models

830
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,240
here are giving us a bird's eye view of

831
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,799
that fitness landscape or mountain range

832
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,720
that I mentioned.

833
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,720
We can then computationally explore the

834
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,559
remaining sequence space that there is.

835
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,919
And so we can take this predictive map

836
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,080
and use generative artificial

837
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,080
intelligence models to design sequences

838
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
that are better than before. Uh and

839
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,080
here's how this works. We start with a

840
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,000
set of sequences, maybe a batch of

841
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,120
random

842
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,880
sequences. We pass those to our

843
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,519
predictive model which already knows how

844
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,559
MP works and knows what the readout from

845
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,559
an experiment might be. And we feed that

846
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,640
prediction into a generative model which

847
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,720
can update our sequences so they reach

848
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,640
the highest predicted possible activity

849
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,679
for any user specified task. So

850
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,760
something that's more cell type

851
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,559
specific, something that's more active,

852
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,000
what have you. We can validate these

853
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,679
results using a massively parallel

854
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
reporter essay. Again, taking things

855
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,440
back into cells and observing the real

856
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,760
biology at hand. And then we can even

857
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,360
continue the cycle modeling uh and going

858
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,440
forward from there with active learning

859
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,120
processes.

860
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,360
When we test our computationally

861
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
designed sequences in vivo, we have some

862
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,799
really promising results. Uh this is a

863
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,519
striking figure from a paper that we

864
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,600
published last year uh in nature showing

865
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,159
that when we take our neuronal specific

866
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,399
CR and tag it onto a reporter, we can

867
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,240
achieve brain specific expression uh in

868
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,080
an embryionic mouse. So we're very

869
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,960
excited about this, but there's a lot of

870
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,799
work that remains to extend from the

871
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,480
these early results towards new cell

872
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,320
types and more importantly therapeutic

873
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,159
applications. uh and this is where the

874
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,159
work with the latter secures initiative

875
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,519
comes

876
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:49,440
in. So we think that with the right CRA,

877
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,000
the right vector, we might be able to

878
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,240
build fitforpurpose gene therapies that

879
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,960
exploit our genome's regulatory code to

880
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,039
cure rare diseases. The first challenge

881
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,519
that we've tackled with L2C uh is this

882
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,519
idea of optimizing cargo space. As this

883
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,960
group likely knows well uh in gene

884
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,640
therapy vectors, viral vectors,

885
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,799
nanoparticles, etc., size is everything.

886
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,480
And so the framework that I showed you

887
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,360
previously is actually to design

888
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,360
enhancers which are positioned upstream

889
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,360
of the promoter that actually drives the

890
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,320
transcription of genes. Uh but together

891
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,440
this complex works to initiate gene

892
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,360
expression. But what if we could

893
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,200
restrict the range of sequence that

894
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,480
we're actually actually optimizing. So

895
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,159
it's optimally small uh and can be

896
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,919
inserted just with the gene of interest

897
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,159
so that we don't have this 200 base pair

898
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,320
enhancer a linker sequence and all sorts

899
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,399
of other stuff that might interfere with

900
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,720
the size carrying capacity of our of our

901
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,159
vector here. Uh and so we've been trying

902
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,880
to leverage this framework that I showed

903
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,960
you to design minimal promoters. To do

904
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,880
so we've designed an MP library that

905
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,640
takes in a lot of design facets of what

906
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,880
we might think comprises a minimal

907
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,399
promoter. So things like what are the

908
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,039
highest predicted transcription

909
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,120
initiation peaks uh what are known

910
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,120
promoter motifs and a couple other

911
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,039
methods here and we're testing those in

912
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:10,119
a few cell types uh K562s HEP G2s and

913
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,399
HEC 293 so it's blood uh liver and

914
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,240
kidney and the reason we've chosen this

915
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,040
system is that it recapitulates a

916
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,919
classic uh therapeutic evaluation system

917
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,359
for human ariththropotin or EPO uh and

918
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,960
the reason we think EPO is interesting

919
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,320
is that it has a number of physiological

920
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,320
ical effects that we might be able to

921
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,800
exploit for later validation of this

922
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,200
pipeline. Uh so a little more detail on

923
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,440
EPO. It's a regulator of the oxygen

924
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,280
carrying capacity of the body. Uh it

925
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,679
acts on ariththroidid progenitors in the

926
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,679
bone marrow. Uh is produced primarily in

927
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,079
the kidney and then has some secondary

928
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,520
production also in the liver. And so in

929
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,359
our cell types, if we can engineer

930
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,359
specificity for promoters that act in

931
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,200
these three different tissue types,

932
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,159
organ types, then we might be able to

933
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,760
see them with EPO as a readout. uh and

934
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,919
more interestingly for rare diseases,

935
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,680
EPO deficiency can be congenital but

936
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,760
also has this tie to common diseases

937
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,000
which I think Raj touched on earlier

938
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,440
where you can actually have acquired EPO

939
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,599
deficiency as a result of things like

940
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,440
chronic kidney disease. Uh so this is an

941
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,760
aspect of that nodal biology we've been

942
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,400
talking about. And so we're going to

943
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,720
test our theories in the ecosystem using

944
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,800
a nanoparticle lipid nanoparticle uh

945
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,119
containing our promoter gene construct

946
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,280
delivered to each of these three

947
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,920
different tissue types in invivo mouse

948
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,359
models. This work is being done um in

949
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,280
collaboration with Savin Patel and the

950
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,280
Batia group. Uh and so we're going to do

951
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,599
two primary assays once we have these

952
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,760
designed promoters in hand. The first is

953
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,480
a pharmacocinetics based assay where we

954
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,880
do elya um from human arthropotin

955
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,800
expression in mice. Uh and the second is

956
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,440
looking at specificity with whole organ

957
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,200
imaging with our GFP and then eventually

958
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,720
also single cell readouts to see exactly

959
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,200
where our constructs are going and where

960
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,560
they're being

961
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,720
expressed. But more broadly this idea of

962
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,240
a minimal promoter can be extended to a

963
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,520
whole host of rare diseases. And this is

964
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,000
the framework that I want to share with

965
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,599
you today. Uh while this minimal

966
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,800
promoter work in these three cell types

967
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,480
is exciting. We think there's a whole

968
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,440
more whole bigger world that's there to

969
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,000
be explored uh in many many cell types.

970
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,320
Here in the L2C grant we're focused on

971
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,560
three which are skeletal muscle, cardiac

972
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,240
muscle and smooth muscle. And we think

973
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,400
there are a lot of exciting applications

974
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,560
here. And so to close I will share a

975
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,839
couple of

976
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,280
these. The first is something that is

977
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,560
likely familiar to many in the rare

978
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,839
disease community and I think our next

979
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,480
speaker will be touching on this a

980
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,400
little bit too. Uh Duchens

981
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,720
musculardrophe. Um so it's caused by a

982
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
mutation in the distrophin gene and has

983
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,440
de devastating effects on muscular

984
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,040
tissue and also systemically and so

985
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,560
there are a number of offtarget effects

986
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,640
that are actually caused by the existing

987
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,880
gene therapies on the market for DMD

988
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,680
which either aim to deliver distrophin

989
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,599
natively or edit the genome itself. Uh

990
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,960
we think that if we can target muscle

991
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,640
cells specifically with a muscle

992
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,240
specific promoter and enhancer we might

993
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,119
be able to ameliorate some of these

994
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,880
which would be very

995
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,560
exciting. And beyond enhancing existing

996
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,800
therapeutic applications, we think our

997
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,040
CRES uh could lead to novel therapeutics

998
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,560
in and of themselves. And one exciting

999
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,119
disease that we're thinking about here

1000
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,839
is hereditary hemorrhagic

1001
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,560
talangjectasia, which is a bit of a

1002
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,680
mouthful uh but we can just call it HHT.

1003
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,440
Uh HHT is caused by a loss of the

1004
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,760
endogen protein, which is a structural

1005
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,839
protein in blood vessels and has a

1006
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,320
number of devastating effects, strokes,

1007
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,560
anemia, heart failure, hemorrhage. uh

1008
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,720
and if we can deliver endoglen natively

1009
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,960
to smooth muscle cells we might be able

1010
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,880
to prevent these and that's very

1011
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,680
exciting as well uh we can conceive of

1012
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,920
this cell type specific CR that we can

1013
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,400
use to drive increased expression of

1014
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,160
normal

1015
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,160
endogllin and so to close I just want to

1016
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,839
come back to this framework that we can

1017
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,200
use high throughput experimentation of

1018
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,359
any kind combined with computational

1019
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,760
optimization to drive cell type specific

1020
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,520
therapies or any sort of therapy uh that

1021
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,440
can't be optimized by natural sequence

1022
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,960
alone. Uh this is the kind of framework

1023
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,880
that's going to allow us to move beyond

1024
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,599
the biology that we see to the biology

1025
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,680
that we create. Uh and I'm very grateful

1026
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,240
to be part of the team to to do this. Um

1027
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,720
and so I have to thank several people uh

1028
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,119
primarily my PIs Partisan Singita but

1029
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,800
also Sager Savan Brian a rotation

1030
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,880
student who just finished up with me uh

1031
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,440
and everybody listed above and happy to

1032
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,200
take any questions.

1033
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,520
Thank you. We'll take questions at the

1034
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,280
end.

1035
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,800
So our last speaker um is Dr. Michelle

1036
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,880
Ren Renarajin and um she scrubbed her

1037
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
online presence while I was looking to

1038
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,839
find anecdotes about her and only

1039
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,599
professional things. So she's um where

1040
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,880
is she? right here uh an

1041
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,480
endocrinologist, an MD uh scientist,

1042
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,240
physician, endocrinologist and

1043
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,520
geneticist working on autoimmune

1044
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,880
diseases and duchen musculardrophe and

1045
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,880
her the title of her talk is

1046
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,480
[Applause]

1047
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:07,520
dysfun um and also new in the world of

1048
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,680
being a PI and so Um, I'm not going to

1049
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,920
talk overly specifically about our exact

1050
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,839
letters to curious accelerator project,

1051
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,240
but kind of going to talk more broadly

1052
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,480
about the way my lab is looking at

1053
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,400
taking on Duchenne. Um, and very

1054
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,560
selfishly doing this because we're quite

1055
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,920
eager to find people to join our team

1056
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,440
both in the lab and also as

1057
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,160
collaborators. So, I'm happy to talk to

1058
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,119
anyone um

1059
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:34,400
afterwards. Um so the distrophen protein

1060
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:38,000
is a um large muscle regulatory protein

1061
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,800
um that links the is there pointer? Oh

1062
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,720
um that links the actin cytokeleton to

1063
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,800
the muscle cell membrane um and

1064
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,720
nucleates a large membrane bound protein

1065
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,560
complex in the muscle cell nucleus

1066
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,040
that's critical for maintaining muscle

1067
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,119
integrity um particularly in the face of

1068
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,280
muscle contraction. Um the DMD gene um

1069
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,079
is the largest gene in the body at 2.4

1070
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,440
four megabase pairs. It's on the X

1071
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,720
chromosome. Um, and the protein product

1072
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:09,200
is about 3600 amino acids, um,

1073
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,720
comprising 79 exxons. Um, in duchen, um,

1074
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,400
as I'll talk about in a bit, there's a

1075
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,720
number of different mutations, but the

1076
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,800
most common mutation is a large deletion

1077
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,320
of one or more exxons that leads to an

1078
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,560
out that leads to an out of frame

1079
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,480
transcript. Um, and this in turn leads

1080
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,400
to transcript instability and loss of

1081
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,000
protein expression.

1082
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
The consequence of this transcript

1083
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,240
instability is quite dire um and causes

1084
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,760
the disease duchen musculardrophe or DMD

1085
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,640
um which is a progressive terminal

1086
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,320
disease with no known cure. Um it

1087
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,480
primarily because the gene is on the X

1088
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:47,680
chromosome almost exclusively affects um

1089
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,359
uh boys um but begins with ongoing

1090
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,920
cardiac and skeletal muscle damage

1091
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,079
starting at birth. Um this results in

1092
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,680
the loss of ambulation somewhere between

1093
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,680
the ages of 9 and 15 um due to diaphragm

1094
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,680
weakness the need for non-invasive

1095
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,680
ventilation in the late teens and

1096
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,920
ultimately death from cardiac failure

1097
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,359
somewhere in the late teens um into the

1098
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,680
20s. Um however despite this really dire

1099
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,920
course the disease trajectory is

1100
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,440
modifiable. And so if we look just at

1101
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,040
cohorts that are born at different

1102
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,240
times, if you compare a cohort of

1103
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,520
patients born before 1970 to those born

1104
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,920
between 1970 and 1990 or after 1990, you

1105
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,520
can see a clear shift in survival. And I

1106
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,440
just want to emphasize that this is not

1107
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,160
from a therapeutic intervention. This is

1108
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,680
advances in clinical care. Um, so there

1109
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,520
is reason to believe that effective

1110
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,480
therapies could actually push this curve

1111
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,240
out much, much farther.

1112
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,920
Um, so something I hear all the time

1113
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,240
these days is, "I thought I heard about

1114
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,960
a cure for DMD." And so while there have

1115
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,400
been many new drug approvals, I want to

1116
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,640
emphasize that none of these are really

1117
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,359
curative. Um, standard of care is

1118
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,599
highdosese corticosteroids, there is an

1119
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,040
approved microistine gene therapy that

1120
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,280
was mentioned that's available for

1121
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,119
patients above the age of four. Um, but

1122
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,119
a huge issue with this is naturally

1123
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,560
existing immunity to the viral vector

1124
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,880
that prevents safe and effective

1125
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,280
administration of this drug. There are

1126
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,720
significant safety concerns and I think

1127
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,480
it's fair to say that at this point the

1128
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,480
durability and benefit of this drug have

1129
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,680
been quite

1130
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,599
disappointing. Um there are mutation

1131
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,520
specific exxon skipping therapies that

1132
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,079
are available for three quite common

1133
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,599
exxons. These result in very minimal m

1134
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,760
muscle delivery less than 1% of um

1135
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,440
normal levels of distrophen. And while

1136
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,520
there are ongoing trials with better

1137
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,359
delivery mechanisms, these only target

1138
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,160
the four most common exxons in this

1139
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,079
disease. Um there's an HDAC inhibitor

1140
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,800
that was recently approved. It may

1141
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,400
prolong um ambulation but likely with

1142
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,040
some effects on the bone marrow that are

1143
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,079
manifest as

1144
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,160
thrombocytoenia and many additional

1145
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,640
drugs are ongoing or expected in

1146
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,119
clinical trials. Um but I just want to

1147
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,760
emphasize that it can be a very very

1148
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,240
long time from proof of concept in the

1149
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,400
preclinical space to getting a drug into

1150
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,400
patients. So lined up against the life

1151
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,839
expectancy of someone with duchen. If we

1152
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,560
look at the most recent approvals for

1153
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,960
gvenatin HDAC inhibitor

1154
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,920
um the approved microistrphan gene

1155
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,920
therapy and a novel steroid you can see

1156
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,960
that the timelines here are just far too

1157
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,319
long for anyone living with this disease

1158
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,440
today. And many of those challenges

1159
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,960
occur because DMD is really a microcosm

1160
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,359
of the challenges of rare disease

1161
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,599
therapeutic development at large. Um so

1162
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,359
the diagnosis is late. We know there's

1163
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,359
damage occurring at birth. Most kids are

1164
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,839
diagnosed even today between the ages of

1165
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,920
four and five years old. It's a very

1166
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,240
large gene and a very large protein. And

1167
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,760
this has implications for delivery. It

1168
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,520
also has implications for the kinds of

1169
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,000
mutations we see. So thousands of

1170
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,520
different mutations have been

1171
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,240
identified. Um and all different kinds

1172
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,880
of mutations. So 60 to 70% are large

1173
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,680
deletions. We also see um nonsense

1174
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,720
mutations, other point mutations um and

1175
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,000
large duplications. And also compounding

1176
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,680
those many different mutations is um a

1177
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,440
substantial amount of disease

1178
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,480
heterogeneity that makes it really

1179
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,880
difficult to run effective clinical

1180
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,800
trials. Um the target tissue is vast and

1181
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,880
I think like many rare diseases the

1182
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,800
commercial incentives which do exist for

1183
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,440
some mutations with duchen leave many

1184
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,520
many people out. Um so the objective of

1185
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,440
my lab is to accelerate distrophin

1186
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,160
restoring therapies for every living

1187
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,880
patient with DMD. And just to emphasize

1188
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,880
what we mean by that, um, we're agnostic

1189
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,480
to

1190
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,640
modality. Um, we want to treat every

1191
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,560
patient regardless of their mutation,

1192
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,760
regardless of their ability to walk, and

1193
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,200
regardless of their neurocognitive

1194
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,839
ability. And we really want to focus on

1195
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,040
living patients. Um, so I just flew back

1196
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,960
yesterday from ASGCT. I can tell you the

1197
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,359
future looks very bright for kids born

1198
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,040
with this disease in 2050, but those

1199
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,760
solutions might not be available to kids

1200
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,839
living with this disease now.

1201
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,839
And so we've taken this on by first

1202
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:01,359
focusing on mutation specific approaches

1203
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,760
for rare exxons um developing biomarkers

1204
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,400
that might be able to truly track

1205
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,960
trajectory um and and focusing very

1206
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,240
deeply on seropositivity and AAV. And I

1207
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,240
should step back and say when I say

1208
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,839
we've taken this on we are really at the

1209
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,560
earliest steps of of all of

1210
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:20,000
these. Um so exxon skipping um is an

1211
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,319
approach to try to restore a

1212
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,720
distrophin-l like protein um in patients

1213
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,800
with DMD. And so the way this works is

1214
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,359
if we look at full length distrophen in

1215
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,040
a patient with a mutation we have an out

1216
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,880
of frame mutation um an anti-sense

1217
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,599
oligouonucleotide that prevents um

1218
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,440
splicing of the next exxon can restore

1219
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,520
the reading frame and produce a

1220
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,839
distrophin with an inframe internal

1221
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,079
deletion. And we have substantial

1222
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,680
evidence from human genetic studies that

1223
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,040
that demonstrates that these internally

1224
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,920
deleted distrophins can be quite

1225
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,200
functional. The challenge of this

1226
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,520
approach is that 40% um of skip

1227
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,640
amendable mutations are not in existing

1228
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,240
pipelines. Um so I've just listed um

1229
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,560
five different companies that are in

1230
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,560
clinical trials in this space and what

1231
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,960
you can see is that they're focused on

1232
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,680
five um mutations. So how do we think

1233
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:18,000
about getting to these non um

1234
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,440
non-commercial exxons? Um so the first

1235
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,760
thing we wanted to think about are what

1236
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,920
are the slow steps in the process of

1237
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,319
getting an exxon skipping drug into the

1238
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,880
clinic. And one of the first steps that

1239
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,440
is still extremely slow is the way in

1240
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,680
which we find targets. And so currently

1241
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,560
um predictive models are not as great as

1242
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,359
we would like. And so most um ASO

1243
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,680
targets are found by tiling um

1244
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,359
overlapping anti-sense oligos across the

1245
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,280
region of interest. So you start out

1246
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,240
with hundreds of oligos tiling your

1247
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,640
exxon in the flanking sequence. Um

1248
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,800
identify the top constructs, make more

1249
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,119
oligos, and then um do a secondary

1250
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,119
screen of sort of the best fits. If

1251
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,880
you're looking at just one exxon, this

1252
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,359
is probably the best way to do it. But

1253
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,760
if you're looking at 79, suddenly the

1254
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,280
scale becomes very very difficult. Um

1255
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,520
and so we've launched a collaboration

1256
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,520
with Sylvie Ruskin where we're hoping to

1257
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,760
both employ higher throughput screening

1258
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,240
strategies for target finding and also

1259
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,720
feed that into models for predicting um

1260
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,560
optimal ASO targets with the hope of

1261
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,160
just getting much better predictions and

1262
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,240
so that we're actually screening closer

1263
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,760
to 10 oligos per exon rather than

1264
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,079
hundreds. Um we're also working very

1265
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,480
closely um with patient advocacy groups

1266
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,599
um parent project musculardrophe in the

1267
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,560
hope of trying to build some long-term

1268
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,880
bioreositories that will facilitate

1269
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,040
mutation specific approaches both for

1270
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,760
anti-sense oligos but also in the future

1271
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,200
for things like editing um potentially

1272
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,200
even large insertions in the

1273
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,760
future. Um a a big question about this

1274
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,040
these sorts of rare approaches is c can

1275
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,079
we rapidly show efficacy in a single

1276
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,160
individual. So I mentioned that the

1277
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,040
clinical course of DMD is heterogeneous.

1278
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,760
And so what I'm showing you here is the

1279
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,000
the standard scale um for measuring

1280
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,680
motor ability in these children. It's a

1281
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,440
17point scale called the Northstar

1282
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,920
ambulatory assessment. And I'm showing

1283
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,720
you this scale over time. And each gray

1284
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,800
line is an individual

1285
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,560
trajectory. So you can create an average

1286
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,280
trajectory, but you can see that there's

1287
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,599
substantial spread from that average

1288
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,520
trajectory. Um, Franchesco Moni at UCL

1289
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,160
has done some really nice work trying to

1290
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,839
extract different classes of disease

1291
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,760
from these trajectories. And you can see

1292
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,599
that here where the individual

1293
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,200
trajectories are covered by class. And

1294
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,599
now the averages for these individual

1295
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,960
trajectories look quite different. But

1296
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,920
if we focus on sort of the earliest ages

1297
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,960
here, you can see that there's

1298
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,119
considerable overlap and you need quite

1299
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,920
a bit of time to actually see trajectory

1300
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,760
separation. And this is kind of

1301
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,520
reflected in our in our current clinical

1302
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,040
trials, right? So we typically sample

1303
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,599
patients who are in the four to seven

1304
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,240
age range, follow them for a year, look

1305
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,400
at the average change in baseline in

1306
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,599
placebot treated versus drug treated

1307
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,119
individuals um and sort of hope that

1308
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,520
you've um randomized enough people that

1309
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,119
you actually have comparable

1310
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,800
populations. But of course with a rare

1311
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,079
disease and a small trial that

1312
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,319
randomization is often biased. And so

1313
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,800
what we would really like is we would

1314
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,559
like to take have some sort of baseline

1315
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,520
measure that we follow patients in a

1316
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,240
run-in period treat

1317
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,520
um and then be able to say this is this

1318
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,280
patient's projected trae uh expected

1319
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,520
trajectory and this is what we're

1320
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,040
actually seeing. And so ideally we want

1321
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,720
to be able to much quicker say this

1322
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,440
individual patient has switched their

1323
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,200
trajectory as a result of this disease.

1324
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,000
Um and so again we're just beginning to

1325
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,079
explore these but really looking at um

1326
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,240
non-invasive markers of tissue damage

1327
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,559
using self-free DNA based approaches um

1328
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,599
and extracellular vesicle analysis as

1329
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,119
well as wear wearablebased approaches to

1330
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,880
measure motor function that we think

1331
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,640
will be more accessible to the full

1332
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,280
range of ages and the full range of

1333
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,400
cognitive ability um in this

1334
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,599
disease. All right. And so the last

1335
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,920
thing I want to talk about is

1336
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,359
seropositivity and AIV. And this is

1337
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,440
actually something that's a bit bigger

1338
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,200
than my own lab but but really grew out

1339
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,559
of the ladders to cures accelerator. And

1340
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,680
so I wanted to give an update on where

1341
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,079
that's been. Um so currently the

1342
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,520
standard for gene therapy is

1343
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:28,000
adnoassociated virus. Um and while many

1344
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,280
of the um AAV viruses that are used

1345
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,200
might have been were isolated from

1346
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,319
either humans or animals, many of these

1347
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,160
viruses circulate in humans and so most

1348
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,960
many people have antibodies to these

1349
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,040
viruses. Um and so if we look in DMD at

1350
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,599
the AAV capsids that have reached the

1351
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:49,520
clinic, AAV RH74 about 14% of patients

1352
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:51,839
have antibodies to this vector. Um AAV8

1353
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,520
um 44% of patients have antibodies to

1354
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,119
this vector. AAV9 32% and SLV 101 is a

1355
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,839
new capsid that's expected to have

1356
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,760
similar immunogenicity to AAV9. So we're

1357
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,200
excluding quite a lot of patients who

1358
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,200
cannot get these vectors because their

1359
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,040
antibodies would neutralize the vector

1360
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,599
preventing an efficacious effect and

1361
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:14,400
then potentially also lead to safety

1362
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:16,319
complications. Um and so last November

1363
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,760
um we sponsored a meeting or ladder to

1364
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,839
cure sponsored a meeting along with

1365
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,440
parent project musculardrophe here at

1366
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:25,359
the broad focused just on this topic.

1367
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,760
Um, and a as a result of that meeting,

1368
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,000
we formed the all-in AAV consortium,

1369
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,400
which now has representatives from over

1370
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,800
13 AAV companies as well as 13 different

1371
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,559
academic and nonprofit institutions with

1372
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,559
the objective of accelerating safe

1373
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,880
clinical trials of AAV gene therapy in

1374
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,319
cerositive patients. And so at the

1375
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,880
start, we're aiming to really advance

1376
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,280
diagnostic tools um such as universal

1377
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,200
standardized antibbody testing and also

1378
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,599
fill scientific clinical and knowledge

1379
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,880
gaps and create a um create a structure

1380
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,359
for standardized protocols for

1381
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,599
evaluating complications and emphasizing

1382
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:02,000
the need for sharing that data so that

1383
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,400
we can all share information to develop

1384
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,400
safer therapies.

1385
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:12,000
Um, and so with that, um, I'll just

1386
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,520
thank my lab who's here. Um, some really

1387
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,160
wonderful collaborators who have helped

1388
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,920
us get this off the ground. Um, and I

1389
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,880
just want to issue a a big thanks to

1390
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,200
Anna Grea, Julian Shaw, and the LTC

1391
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,960
Accelerator. Um, generally people don't

1392
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,640
advise you to change fields when you

1393
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,640
start a lab, and so it was really

1394
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,960
wonderful to have some really early

1395
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:34,200
support from this

1396
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,200
group. Thank you.

1397
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,200
Do we have time for questions? So, Nile

1398
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,119
and

1399
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,800
Ara. Uh, while people are lining up, I'm

1400
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,200
sure you have tons of questions. Line

1401
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,880
up. Line up. Uh, I I'll start maybe with

1402
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,680
a couple questions to the speakers. So,

1403
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,040
Nile, I all these amazing novel

1404
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:58,240
sequencing technologies. What would you

1405
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:00,559
recommend clinicians to or patients who

1406
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,160
had a genetic test done in the past and

1407
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,680
it was a either a panel or an exo and

1408
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,440
they didn't have a finding would you

1409
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,200
recommend to them to come back and have

1410
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,520
a

1411
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:14,040
retest with a whole genome? Yeah, I mean

1412
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,559
I think working obviously with

1413
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:19,520
their you know physician geneticist

1414
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,760
genetic counselors um and whoever sort

1415
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,720
of looking at their data but I do think

1416
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,480
if you know people have had gene panels

1417
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,079
certainly it's a reasonable you know

1418
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,599
time to go back and do whole genome

1419
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,760
sequencing

1420
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,400
um you know some of the newer things are

1421
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,240
not going to be available yet

1422
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,920
for that kind of reanalysis or reflex

1423
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:42,000
testing but um but but yeah but you know

1424
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,040
as the technology advances every couple

1425
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,599
of years, it's probably worth a

1426
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,960
reanalysis for sure. Thank you. Um Arya,

1427
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:53,040
can I ask you, you talked about cell

1428
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,280
specificity for your promoters? What

1429
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,599
about level of expression because in

1430
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,079
some disorders it's very important not

1431
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,760
to overexpress just as much as not to

1432
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,400
underexpress. How do you see your

1433
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,240
promoter's position for that? Yeah. Uh

1434
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,000
we we view our framework as being highly

1435
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,839
customizable to any level of user

1436
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,319
specified tasks including level of

1437
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,680
activity or expression. Uh we think we

1438
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,000
can use our framework to design things

1439
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,480
that are exquisitly tunable, exquisitly

1440
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,240
specific. Uh and also the opposite. We

1441
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,640
can design things that are robustly

1442
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:26,160
active or tunable across cell types as

1443
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,880
well. Thank you. Hi. I have a question

1444
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,720
for Nile. Um, I'll fully admit that I

1445
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,559
have taxed the patience of all your

1446
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,960
project managers when I submit three

1447
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,480
samples from one family. I feel like,

1448
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,640
you know, it's, you know, you guys are

1449
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,960
so used to like thousands, hundreds of

1450
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,720
thousands of samples that like you

1451
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,200
immediately know you're losing money on

1452
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,880
my 80 emails that it'll require. But

1453
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,480
I'll say that the one thing that's been

1454
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,640
really exciting is that you have this

1455
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,000
platform called Seeker for someone like

1456
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,839
me who doesn't do this sort of

1457
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,839
computational analysis to take the

1458
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,559
sequencing data and identify causal

1459
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,920
variance with just like a graphical

1460
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:02,000
interface. But I think the support for

1461
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,440
that has been spotty at times and I was

1462
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
curious if you're going to expand those

1463
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,880
things or even like have a specific

1464
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,400
project like workflow for just these

1465
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,240
like kind of three, you know, three

1466
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,920
samples from one family sort of

1467
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,079
projects.

1468
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,359
Yeah. So, so to your first point, so

1469
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,000
certainly for things like whole genome

1470
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,480
sequencing, the whole point is, you

1471
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,720
know, we try

1472
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:27,040
to get kind of operational for a second,

1473
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,119
the when you have like 15 giant machines

1474
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,440
like that, it's like running an airline,

1475
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,520
right? So, if they're not running,

1476
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,040
you're losing money. So, we our whole

1477
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,599
point is like we try to like keep them

1478
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,280
full, keep them go go go. Um, and we do

1479
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,960
that by aggregating tons of demand

1480
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,680
across all kinds of research and

1481
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,359
translational work. But the whole point

1482
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,880
of doing that is if you can run keep

1483
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,400
them full, you can run them efficiently

1484
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,480
and try to keep the cost as low as you

1485
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,960
can. And for anyone who comes with a

1486
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,280
standard like a genome test, one sample

1487
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,440
is totally fine because it's standard

1488
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,280
like it's built to just fit into the

1489
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,520
exact workflow where small sample

1490
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,000
numbers become an issue is more when

1491
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,319
it's a bespoke assay and where you have

1492
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,920
to kind of burn a whole sequencing run

1493
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,440
where you get charged the same amount

1494
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,280
from aluminum no matter what how many

1495
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,799
samples we run on it. And if we can't

1496
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,880
aggregate that's when it starts to

1497
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,960
become expensive. So the operation is

1498
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,480
really designed even though it so it

1499
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,880
shouldn't be intimidated that like it it

1500
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,920
runs lots of samples small numbers of

1501
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,920
samples using existing assays. It's

1502
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,520
totally totally good for that. the

1503
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,640
second part of the question. So

1504
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,559
interestingly, so Seeker um really, you

1505
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,640
know, we can't claim um sort of credit

1506
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,720
for that sort of you know, Heidi's team

1507
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,640
and O'Donnell and and and the rare

1508
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,880
disease team who've really kind of kept

1509
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,200
that u built it, developed it, kept

1510
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,200
iterating on it for the purpose of sort

1511
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:49,040
of this sort of rare disease research.

1512
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,720
Um and so this is where we have to make

1513
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,760
sometimes make hard decisions. So,

1514
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:56,640
Seeker is built as a research platform.

1515
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,960
Because of that, it doesn't have some of

1516
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,319
the things you would need to run it as a

1517
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,559
clinical platform. So, we can't validate

1518
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:07,280
it for our clea interpret. So, we don't

1519
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,280
use Seeker to sign out diagnostic tests.

1520
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,960
We use other thirdparty software just

1521
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,280
because they've been built specifically

1522
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,400
for that purpose and they have, you

1523
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,920
know, lock down software and live in in

1524
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,240
secure locations and all that kind of

1525
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,559
stuff. So Seeker has remained the tool

1526
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,640
that's super valuable, but also because

1527
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,880
it was built with this kind of discovery

1528
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,480
research mode in mind. The input to

1529
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,400
Seeker, which actually is more of the

1530
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,559
issue that you brought up in number one,

1531
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,400
the input to seek is a joint call set.

1532
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,200
Seeker doesn't take a single sample as

1533
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,720
an input. So that's a that's also a

1534
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,000
limitation in using it in a clinical

1535
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,760
workflow where you kind of want to be

1536
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,319
able to run your entire end to end with

1537
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,480
one sample or one trio um rather than

1538
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:49,440
create a joint call set to load into the

1539
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,119
seeker environment. Um so that's so so

1540
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,720
again it's sort of used in a different

1541
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,720
part of the community. It's not part of

1542
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,040
our clinical workflow that our team

1543
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,640
runs. Um the second part about sort of

1544
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,400
maintaining and continuing to develop it

1545
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,000
is a completely different kind of worms

1546
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,599
and that's all about how do we fund

1547
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,520
software maintenance and development and

1548
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,520
investment at an institutional level and

1549
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,280
that's really tricky because

1550
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,799
unfortunately you know again our mission

1551
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,400
is to try to keep the cost down as much

1552
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:16,319
as we can because the community and the

1553
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,920
marketplace assumes a certain amount of

1554
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:22,160
like low cost to run things which means

1555
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,079
there's not a lot of extra like

1556
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,119
contribution in every sample to to

1557
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,119
invest in certainly homegrown suffer is

1558
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,760
really expensive and that becomes a

1559
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,760
really a challenge.

1560
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,960
I had a question for Michelle. So um

1561
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,880
correct me if I'm wrong but my

1562
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,520
impression from that AEV symposium the

1563
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,520
one you were referring to was that

1564
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:46,319
serositivity was more of a concern for

1565
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,680
efficacy and not for safety. And so what

1566
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,520
I was wondering, you know, okay, we can

1567
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:53,040
have this symposium with all of these

1568
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,200
companies, but if it's not effective,

1569
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,960
what does the sharing of the data like

1570
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,640
ultimately accomplish? And maybe I'm

1571
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,480
naive about that. Yeah. No, I think

1572
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,160
that's a really good point. I also think

1573
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,480
safety was sort of under discussed at

1574
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,000
that symposium. Um I would argue I think

1575
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,480
there are some safety concerns, but I

1576
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,359
agree that that was the consensus that

1577
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,280
day. Um I think um so sort of two

1578
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,440
concerns, right? So the presence of

1579
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,359
antibodies binds capsid prevents capsid

1580
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,559
from reaching the target tissue. That's

1581
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:23,119
the concern for efficacy. Um the safety

1582
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,200
concern is that you have you know one of

1583
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,000
the big safety issues that has been seen

1584
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,280
with gene therapy is thrombotic

1585
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,760
microangopathy. Um and so the concern is

1586
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,359
you have lots of

1587
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,359
which presumably through classical

1588
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,680
compliment activation. So you have lots

1589
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,480
of antibodies, you have lots of capsid,

1590
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,240
that combination leads to antibbody

1591
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,440
mediated activation of the compliment

1592
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,520
cascade and then ultimately TMA. So the

1593
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,400
presence of antibodies can cause both of

1594
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,960
those things.

1595
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,520
No, no one is intentionally dosing with

1596
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,040
some exceptions antibbody high patients

1597
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,720
currently. It's actually an exclusion

1598
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,040
criteria for most of the clinical

1599
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,200
trials. Um so the idea of the consortium

1600
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,200
is actually what do we need to do to

1601
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,040
mitigate both the safety and efficacy

1602
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,880
concerns so that these patients can get

1603
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,400
an efficacious gene therapy. So we're

1604
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,400
really thinking about things like

1605
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,960
combining capsid evolution with immune

1606
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:18,799
modulation strategy. Um it just gets

1607
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,400
very tricky because um preclinical

1608
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:23,680
models don't fully capture some of that

1609
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,920
safety risk. It's just quite a leap to

1610
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,079
get from something working preclinally

1611
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,400
to the clinic in this setting where we

1612
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,960
don't we don't have data to really help

1613
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,799
us understand what's going to happen.

1614
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,280
So Michelle, if I can follow up on that

1615
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:39,520
because we are starting a a neurological

1616
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,160
gene therapy program now in neurology,

1617
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,640
we do not exclude zeropositive patients.

1618
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,000
We do sample but we do not exclude but

1619
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,160
what we did find is that the

1620
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,079
imunosuppressant protocols are so

1621
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,160
different from one protocol to the

1622
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,839
other. So will your consortium be

1623
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,920
looking at different protocols and

1624
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,760
making recommendations based on past

1625
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,760
experience? Yeah, I think one of the

1626
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,760
things we realized is there different

1627
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,359
protocols in every trial but also like

1628
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,799
different data is being collected and

1629
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,680
shared from every trial. So it's really

1630
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:10,960
hard to learn about immune modulation

1631
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,720
protocols in that way. Um and so part of

1632
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,559
the initial focus is actually like

1633
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,000
setting sort of standardiz standard

1634
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,160
guidelines for like what should be

1635
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,640
collected what should be released so

1636
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,559
that we can try to understand what's the

1637
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,920
effect of these including neurological

1638
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,920
disorders as well or only uh no it's a

1639
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,520
cross disease okay and I'll also add

1640
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,359
like similarly one of the things that

1641
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:36,640
happens is when an adverse event occurs

1642
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:39,520
um frequently it's just people are

1643
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,920
reaching for whatever they can uh that's

1644
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,359
immune modulatory. Everyone does

1645
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,960
something slightly different and it's

1646
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:47,440
really hard to know did you need all of

1647
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,720
those drugs. What do those drugs do? How

1648
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,880
does one protocol? So that's the other

1649
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,559
thing where I think it's really hard in

1650
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,960
the moment where a clinician does not

1651
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,640
have the information they need until

1652
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,319
after the fact, but maybe we can at

1653
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,079
least retroactively try to learn from

1654
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,920
some of these events. That's great.

1655
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,559
Thank you.

1656
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:09,200
a question for now on the constellation

1657
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:13,359
to us. Um can you share any preliminary

1658
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,720
data on performance calling repeats?

1659
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,079
Yeah. So the so the interesting thing

1660
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,400
about constellation moment we have

1661
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,440
access we got access to it over the

1662
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,520
summer last year I think.

1663
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:26,880
Um currently it's like a prep method and

1664
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,400
then the analysis to like get the links.

1665
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,599
What we're working on now in

1666
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,000
collaboration with Lumin is like they

1667
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,880
haven't like we haven't built any

1668
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,200
special callers yet on outside of small

1669
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,559
variants to um to like really leverage

1670
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,200
linkage information. So that's actually

1671
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,839
what Victoria Popek who has a a method

1672
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,760
called Q which was actually originally

1673
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,520
um built to handle there used to be a

1674
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,880
method called from 10X that created

1675
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,319
linked reads. So it was actually

1676
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,880
developed from that. So we're applying

1677
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,960
that to this data type to do a lot

1678
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,119
better on structure variation. I don't

1679
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,119
think we have any repeats. We have a So

1680
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,799
one thing you can do you can actually do

1681
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,960
collocation plots that looks almost like

1682
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,880
a high C plot where you have sort of the

1683
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,680
and you can see you can physically see

1684
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,559
things like um structure variance in it

1685
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,880
that way. But um the actual like callers

1686
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,559
are still in development and then we'll

1687
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,319
run the repeat expansion samples through

1688
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,640
to see how how we're doing on there.

1689
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,640
It's not going to be like the links are

1690
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,960
a couple of KB apart. So you're not it's

1691
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,920
not like you know it's not it's not the

1692
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,920
same as a long read that way.

1693
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:35,280
So I wanted to ask a question um also to

1694
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:37,039
be provocative and to maybe see if that

1695
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,920
spawns any conversations during our

1696
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,520
coffee break and later on today. Um just

1697
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,839
it relates to all the discussions that

1698
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,280
we've been having and maybe um it was

1699
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,839
inspired a little bit by a comment you

1700
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:50,000
made Michelle. So two things and you and

1701
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,760
I have already uh talked about this and

1702
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,520
uh Janet Woodcock and I had talked about

1703
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,680
it and I introduced her to you. This

1704
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,880
idea of like randomized control trials

1705
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,640
in rare diseases may not make a whole

1706
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,319
lot of sense. You you touched upon it

1707
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,119
and the idea that each patient can serve

1708
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:07,200
as their own control if we have enough

1709
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,440
understanding of trajectories and the

1710
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,799
right biomarkers to guide us. So that

1711
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,400
was one thought that I just wanted to

1712
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,559
throw out there and see if you or anyone

1713
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,480
else has thoughts on this. The second

1714
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,119
even more provocative idea that comes

1715
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,400
out of um KJ's example yesterday and

1716
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,799
there's been a little discussion about

1717
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,960
this is what if we treated programmable

1718
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,799
therapeutics you know what Arya and all

1719
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,000
of us you know eventually you know want

1720
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:32,000
to develop as surgeries you know you go

1721
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,079
into a surgeon and you know you get you

1722
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,680
get a procedure and you know it's not

1723
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,200
like there's like a randomized control

1724
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,480
trial for every you know sort of

1725
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,319
procedure you know that you're getting

1726
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,760
or any device that is deployed to get

1727
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,680
like a stent a coronary stent for

1728
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,039
example right so we sort of have an

1729
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,039
understanding of the fact that there's a

1730
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,559
consent for that to happen for this

1731
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,240
individual patient. And what if a

1732
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,960
programmable therapeutic could be

1733
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:55,039
approached in the same way for two or

1734
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,640
three or 10 patients so that it becomes

1735
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,799
like a very sort of personalized

1736
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,799
programmable therapy for uh that

1737
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:03,039
particular mutation. Is that something

1738
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:04,559
that we can imagine uh sort of in the

1739
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,799
future? I know it's these are all big

1740
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,400
topics and very provocative. Just uh

1741
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:09,680
throwing the ideas out there for people

1742
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,640
to consider. I don't know if any of you

1743
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,640
would like I don't want to put you on

1744
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,319
the spot, but I just want to see if you

1745
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,760
have ideas and then maybe we can take it

1746
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,920
into the coffee break as well for

1747
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,039
discussion. Thank you. Yeah. Well, Anna,

1748
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,960
I can certainly take the second

1749
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,640
question. Um, as an aspiring future

1750
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,559
surgeon, I the same things that attract

1751
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,839
me to the field of of surgery, the idea

1752
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,359
of being able to work with individual

1753
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,960
patients and come up with customized

1754
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,960
solutions that are creative and in the

1755
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,440
moment are what drives me to work on

1756
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,880
gene therapies for rare diseases. You're

1757
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,799
right that we should be treating

1758
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,000
patients as individuals. uh but more

1759
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:42,720
importantly that we should be treating

1760
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,799
biology as individuals and I think the

1761
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,440
ideas of doing randomized control trials

1762
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:49,440
for rare diseases inherently um

1763
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,039
deconvolve those two things. We should

1764
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,559
be treating patients as who they are and

1765
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,480
their biology is what it is.

1766
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,480
Programmable therapeutics enable us to

1767
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,559
do that versus the suite of medicines

1768
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,640
that we have at hand right now which do

1769
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,359
do not treat patients as individuals. We

1770
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,799
treat patients as cohorts. Um so maybe

1771
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,200
even in the future and this is

1772
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,559
potentially even more provocative uh we

1773
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,480
can get rid of the randomized control

1774
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,680
trial altogether even for non-genetic

1775
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,240
therapies and think about uh what what

1776
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,680
medicine uh might mean when we evaluate

1777
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,119
each patient individually. For now

1778
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,599
though I think the RCT is great just to

1779
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,599
clarify but

1780
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:26,319
I have so much to say about it to start

1781
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,640
with.

1782
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:33,920
Um I think now today today is one thing.

1783
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:37,039
The future is different. Today when you

1784
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,799
come to a surgeon and they offer you

1785
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,640
some kind of surgery, you Google it. You

1786
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:44,160
want to see what the outcomes are, what

1787
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:46,000
others have experienced. And when there

1788
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,920
isn't data, it's very hard to make

1789
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,520
decisions. And not everyone sits at the

1790
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,960
Broad Institute. Some people are farmers

1791
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,880
and other professions. They're not as

1792
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,400
understanding as we are. and they will

1793
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,079
not have the right information to make

1794
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,760
decisions. So, how do we collect that

1795
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:05,039
information? I think that's a really

1796
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:08,000
important point. Um, and yes, there are

1797
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:09,359
individual patients that have individual

1798
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,039
mutations, but there are a lot of

1799
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:13,119
patients that have similar mutations.

1800
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,240
And again, how do those who know less

1801
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:20,640
about it access these amazing new

1802
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,640
therapies that are being offered here?

1803
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,760
Um, I also have like lots of thoughts on

1804
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,200
all of that. Um I I mean I think you

1805
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,240
know I agree that I don't think

1806
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,000
randomized control trials for rare

1807
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:33,520
disease are necessary or should be

1808
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,880
necessary particularly when we're

1809
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,920
talking about progressive fatal

1810
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,280
diseases. Um uh so you know one of the

1811
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,720
examples that's come out of Duchen is

1812
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,480
it's actually a lot of the trials are

1813
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,960
run to one-year motor end points and

1814
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,640
that's actually probably not enough time

1815
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:50,559
to separate disease trajectories.

1816
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,960
I think almost everyone is in agreement

1817
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,640
that a three to fiveyear placeboc

1818
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,400
controlled trial in a progressive

1819
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,599
terminal pediatric disease is not

1820
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,599
ethically acceptable. Um and so I think

1821
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,160
we have to start figuring out ways to I

1822
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,839
agree like we need data but we need to

1823
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,760
start figuring out ways to like I think

1824
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:10,240
be more creative with natural history to

1825
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,480
develop biomarkers with sort of

1826
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:15,920
correlative functional endpoints and to

1827
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,520
actually try to get away from that. Um

1828
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,880
because I think unless you have an

1829
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,880
endpoint to your randomized I'm an

1830
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,279
endocrinologist so I'm used to six-month

1831
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,040
hemoglobin A1C as a randomized control

1832
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,640
trial for full drug approval right we

1833
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,040
don't have that in rare disease and in

1834
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,440
the absence of something that fast and

1835
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,480
robust I don't think you can ethically

1836
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:36,319
maintain a placebo arm

1837
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,920
also I think we're a far far ways away

1838
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,520
from this time but there is so much work

1839
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,000
going on to do artificial intelligence

1840
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,159
based modeling um for digital twins and

1841
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,920
what have you and we could conceive of a

1842
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,839
world where we do RCTs and uh clonal AI,

1843
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,520
you know, populations. Don't think we're

1844
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,520
there yet, but that work is is

1845
01:08:57,159 --> 01:09:02,199
ongoing. Coffee break until 3:20.
