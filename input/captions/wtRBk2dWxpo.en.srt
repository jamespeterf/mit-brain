1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,879
so today our keynote speaker is Tom

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,480
fredman uh have a story Tom doesn't know

3
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:20,640
uh I first heard him speak uh at a

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,680
graduation ceremony his daugh I think it

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
was his daughter and my son were

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,679
classmates uh and it was the graduation

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,759
ceremony at Yale and I recall him giving

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:34,840
this the graduation speech and

9
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,320
it was truly a tour to force of both

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,840
deep insight and personal commentary

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,120
about their Futures and it occurred to

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,280
me then my Universal answer to the

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,000

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,039
of the very first lectures I ever gave

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,000
about the World is Flat and they put it

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,879
up on the open courseware site and it

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,319

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,480
like that and um I now use it when

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,480
people want me to speak and I just can't

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,400
and some people you know um from far off

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,319
places I can't get to I just say go to

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
open courseware download it it's yours

60
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,040
for free

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120

back here soon thank you for having me

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,519
um what I thought I would do as Steve

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,519
said I've gota I got to update my site

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,120
my open courseware site so that's really

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,200
why I came you know um and uh we're

68
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,480
filming this and so um uh what I thought

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,400
I'd do is share with you um what is now

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,640
the 3.0 edition of The World is Flat

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,360
gone through a couple more iterations um

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,480
my kind of latest thinking on that

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,640
subject um I know some of you have read

74
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,280
the book those of you who haven't I know

75
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,840
who you are uh know where you teach

76
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,360
where you go to school um and uh so

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,120
there'll be a little you know repetition

78
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,120
to just sort of start from ground zero

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,560
and then try to take it forward and then

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,040
uh uh I'd like to just spend a few

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,159
minutes talking about my new book which

82
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,200
will be out in August uh called Green is

83
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,159
the new red white and blue um which is

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,280
about en energy environment because the

85
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,519
two books are actually uh very much

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,760
connected I I I hope it'll come together

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,000
every time I try to do this I'm always

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,799
reminded of this story when they were

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,560
digging the Chunnel under the English

90
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,599
Channel you know connecting Britain and

91
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,480
and Europe they uh they put it out for

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,760
bids and they got bids of $3 billion

93
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,439
from Beckel and 3.1 from halberton all

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,280
these big industrial engineering firms

95
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,519
got one bid from Goldberg and Cohen firm

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,560
on the upper east end of London for

97
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,959
100,000 pound and for fiduciary reasons

98
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,720
they had to check it out so they sent A

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,200
team out to Goldberg and con knocked on

100
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,120
the door con answered Goldberg was on

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,000
the road and they said um Mr Mr Cohen

102
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,760
how can you possibly dig a Chunnel under

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,200
the English Channel for £100,000 he said

104
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,920
what's the problem uh Goldberg will

105
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,439
start on one side a cone will start on

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,760
the other we'll each have a shovel we'll

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
dig until we

108
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,120
meet and he said what if you don't meet

109
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,840
so you'll have two tunnels so so maybe

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,400
you'll have one lecture one maybe you

111
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,120
have two I don't know I I I I hope

112
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,840
they'll meet it's all at for the same

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,840
price

114
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,720
um the the first thing you really need

115
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,440
to know about the World is Flat is that

116
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,680
uh this book came about completely by

117
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,000
accident I wish I could tell you I was

118
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,000
as smart as a MIT Professor this was all

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,360
cooking in my head I unveiled it to the

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,680
world it was all an accident um I became

121
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,919
the New York Times Foreign Affairs

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,080
columnist in January 1995 I um spent uh

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,840
basically from January 1995 until

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,759
September 11th 2001 my column really

125
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,759
oscillated between what I call Lexus

126
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,080
issues and Olive Tree issues issues of

127
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,880
Finance technology trade and issues of

128
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,600
traditional geopolitics and ethnic

129
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,400
conflict and I was really going between

130
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,960
Silicon Valley and the Becka Valley um

131
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,240
in light of what happened on September

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
11th I really dropped the globalization

133
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,600
side of my column which had really been

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,240
a abiding interest and spent the next

135
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,720
three years almost exclusively in the

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,080
Arab Muslim world trying to understand

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,440
the roots of 9/11 I was really in that

138
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,280
mode right up until January of 2004 when

139
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,520
I started doing documentaries for the

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,400
Discovery Channel we had done one on the

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,479
roots of 911 we had done one on the wall

142
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,520
Israel had built in the West Bank and in

143
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,280
January of 2004 we were sitting around

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,840
with our Discovery team trying to figure

145
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,080
out what what should we do our next

146
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,000
documentary on and at the time the big

147
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,319
issue out there the obvious issue to

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,360
take on was why does everyone hate

149
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,000
America and that's how this all got

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,919
started because I had this crazy idea

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,479
that what we should do is go to call

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,520
centers all over the world and interview

153
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,319
young people foreigners who spend their

154
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,800
days imitating Americans on what they

155
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,680
think of

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,960
America that's how the whole thing

157
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,440
started and right in the middle of our

158
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,919
budgeting meetings while we were trying

159
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,400
to figure out which call center centers

160
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,759
to go to John krey came out with his

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,520
blast against Benedict Arnold CEOs who

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,479
engage in

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,440
Outsourcing and suddenly this issue of

164
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,520
Outsourcing just exploded onto the world

165
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,000
stage the front page of the New York

166
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
Times The Wall Street Journal Forbes and

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,919
Fortune I said wait a minute time out

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,919
why why why don't we just go to bangal

169
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
or India and let's do a documentary

170
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,960
called the other side of Outsourcing

171
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,880
where we try to explain this phenomena

172
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,840
from the ground up that's how it started

173
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,400
so we went off to Bangalore on February

174
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,080
15th 20 4 with our Discovery crew we

175
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,560
shot about 60 hours of film in in in 11

176
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,360
days and across those 11 days I got

177
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,240
progressively sicker and sicker uh it

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,639
was nothing I ate it was somewhere

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,560
between the Indian entrepreneur who

180
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,360
wanted to prepare my Maryland tax

181
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,759
returns from Bangalore and the Indian

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,199
entrepreneur who wanted to write my new

183
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,639
software from Bangalore and the Indian

184
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,319
entrepreneur who wanted to read my

185
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,840
x-rays from Bangalore and the Indian

186
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:01,280
entrepreneur who wanted to trace my lost

187
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,000
luggage on Delta lines from Bangalore

188
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,800
that I got this really sick feeling that

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
while I had been sleeping while I had

190
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
been off covering the 911 Wars something

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,280
really big transformative and

192
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,199
fundamental had happened in the

193
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,720
globalization world and I had completely

194
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,440
missed it and it all came together with

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,879
the last interview we did which with

196
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,240
Nandan liani the CEO of nasis one of the

197
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,199
crown jewels of uh India's high-tech

198
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,800
firmament n was an old friend we were

199
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,080
sitting on the couch outside his office

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,599
I had my laptop top in my lap he's

201
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,080
putting up a little plaque there now

202
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,879
where where where where the world's flat

203
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,639
was born and

204
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,160
um Nan said at one point Tom I've got to

205
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,879
tell you the the global economic playing

206
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,680
field is being leveled the global

207
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,720
economic playing field is being leveled

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,479
and you Americans are not

209
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,879
ready oh I wrote that down on my little

210
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,000
laptop the global economic playing field

211
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,479
is being leveled and you Americans are

212
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,360
not ready well after the uh interview um

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,960
I got in my Jeep went back to my hotel

214
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,039
and along the way I kept rolling over in

215
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,280
my mind as is my habit what nand said

216
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,280
the global economic playing field is

217
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,240
being

218
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,360
leveled and after a while it occurred to

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,840
me that what he was really saying was

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,039
that the global economic playing field

221
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,639
is being

222
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,479
flattened and then in the crazy chemical

223
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,840
way these things happen it just popped

224
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
into my head that wand dakani India's

225
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,039
Premier engineer entrepreneur was really

226
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,440
telling me was that the world is flat

227
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:33,120
and I wrote that down in my my notebook

228
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,959
The World is Flat I got back to my hotel

229
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,080
I ran up to my room I called my wife and

230
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,599
Bethesda I said honey I am going to

231
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,919
write a book called The World is

232
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,519
Flat she now says she thought that was a

233
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,040
brilliant

234
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,040
idea it's not how I remember the

235
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,800
conversation but Men Are from Mars Women

236
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,200
Are from Venus um uh but in any event I

237
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,720
did come home and basically call my

238
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,920
owners of the New York Times and say

239
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,440
ladies and gentlemen I need to go on

240
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,040
sabatical immediately I need to go on

241
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,040
sabatical media because my software the

242
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,480
intellectual framework through which I

243
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,399
look at the world is out of date I'm a

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,519
I'm a basic engineer and it's a Java

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,959
world and if I don't go on leave

246
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,640
immediately and update my

247
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,680
software I am going to write something

248
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,079
really stupid in the New York

249
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Times it's a great way to get a leave I

250
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,720
I have to tell

251
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,880
you so I started this book in March of

252
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,399
2004 I turned it in in December do not

253
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,240
try this this trick at home kids um I

254
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,399
blew out my forearms along the way but

255
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,360
in a fit of energy and passion uh

256
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,600
produced kind of the core thesis of this

257
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,160
book and the core thesis sort of the

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,560
meta argument of this book is very

259
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,200
simple The Meta argument is that there

260
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
have been three what I would call three

261
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,839
Great era of globalization uh the first

262
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,959
I call globalization 1.0 it began in

263
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,240
1492 and lasted until the early 1800s

264
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,760
with the beginning of global Arbitrage

265
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,279
that year of globalization Shrunk The

266
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,720
World from a size large to a size medium

267
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,519
and that year of globalization was

268
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,839
really spearheaded by countries

269
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,560
globalizing that is you went Global

270
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,480
through your country nation states were

271
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,279
the dynamic agent of globalization so it

272
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,839
was Spain exploring the Americas Britain

273
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,640
colonizing India Portugal East Asia you

274
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,519
went Global through your country

275
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,800
globalization 2.0 began in the early

276
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,800
1800s lasted till the year 2000 that's

277
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,720
right it just ended it Shrunk The World

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,320
from size medium to size small and that

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
year of globalization was really

280
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,760
spearheaded by companies companies going

281
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,560
global for markets and for labor you

282
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,040
went Global through your company well

283
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,320
while you were sleeping or at least

284
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,800
while I was sleeping we actually entered

285
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,120
globalization 3.0 from the year 2000 to

286
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
the present it shrieking in the world

287
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,560
from size small to size tiny and

288
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,360
flattening the global economic playing

289
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,760
field at the same time only what's

290
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,800
really new really different really

291
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,160
exciting and really terrifying is that

292
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,200
this year of globalization is certainly

293
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,839
not spearheaded by countries and it's

294
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,880
not exclusively spearheaded by companies

295
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,399
anymore what's really new really

296
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,040
different really exciting is that this

297
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,760
era of globalization is spearheaded by

298
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,560
individuals we've gone from a

299
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,920
globalization built around countries to

300
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,680
one built around companies to one built

301
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,959
around

302
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,279
individuals how did we get here how did

303
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,720
we move down this progression to a point

304
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,839
where individuals can now compete

305
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,839
connect and collaborate globally as

306
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,079
individuals well we had to create a

307
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,160
platform really for that to happen I'm

308
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,320
not going to talk about the whole

309
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,639
platform what I call the 10 flatteners

310
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,279
but I'm going to talk about four the

311
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,600
four key ones basically that are

312
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,959
relevant both to open courseware and I

313
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,720
think to where we are today um basically

314
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,639
the first of these four key flatteners

315
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,959
was I'm going to do this really quickly

316
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,800
the PC and what the personal computer

317
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,639
allowed and this is really the beginning

318
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,040
of the whole individual nature of

319
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,120
globalization what the PC allowed was

320
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,040
for individuals

321
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,440
individuals to author their own content

322
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,720
in digital form it's great to be able to

323
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,560
talk about this at MIT where I don't

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,639
have to explain what those things mean

325
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,000
um uh what the PC allowed was for the

326
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,519
first time in the history of the world

327
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,519
for individuals to author their own

328
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,880
content in digital form now individuals

329
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,600
have authored their own content ever

330
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,040
since cave women and cave men etched on

331
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,360
Cave walls but with a PC individuals

332
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,560
could author their own content words

333
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,720
photo data spreadsheets video music in

334
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,959
the form of bits and bites in digital

335
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,360
form and once your content was created

336
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,959
in digital form it could be manipulated

337
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,560
in so many more ways by individuals and

338
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,040
dispatched so many more places that was

339
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,079
the first basic flattener second

340
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,240
flattener some of these are Technologies

341
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,720
others are dates second flattener is a

342
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,240
date 8995 August 9th 1995 which I

343
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,120
consider to be possibly the most

344
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,160
important day in your lifetime

345
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,040
um certainly in our kids' lifetime up to

346
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,639
now because on 8995 a small startup

347
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,160
company in Mountain View California

348
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:15,560
called Netscape went public and the

349
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,160
world has never been the same since

350
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,399
Netscape gave us two two basic

351
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,199
flatteners that changed the world the

352
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,959
first was netscape's invention this

353
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:29,720
simple pointand click device called a

354
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:33,440
browser and what the browser did

355
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,839
was actually give us a tool that brought

356
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,480
the internet to life it was really the

357
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,240
Netscape browser that brought the

358
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,440
internet to life because it allowed us

359
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,399
to illustrate on computer screens

360
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,160
everything locked away in Internet files

361
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,519
and thanks to Tim burners Lee soon to be

362
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,600
websites it was actually the Netscape

363
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,720
browser that made the internet this

364
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,480
incredible tool of connectivity that

365
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,120
Grandma and Grandpa grandson and

366
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,639
granddaughter not just MIT computer

367
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,680
scientists could all use together so

368
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,800
it's really the Netscape browser that

369
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,480
brought the internet to life but that

370
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,800
wasn't the only reason Netscape was a

371
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,360
huge flattener it's because netscape's

372
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,360
IPO Netscape going public on the morning

373
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,040
of 8995 at 9:00 a.m. is what actually

374
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,079
started the.com boom and that triggered

375
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,240
the dot bubble and that triggered the

376
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,959
crazy absurd ridiculous utterly

377
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,839
outrageous overinvestment of $1 trillion

378
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:35,600
dollar that's trillion with

379
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:39,440
T into fiber optic cable in five years

380
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,040
and what that crazy ridiculous absurd

381
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,079
massive overinvestment into fiber optic

382
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,480
cable in five years did was accidentally

383
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,079
wire the world with nobody having

384
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,120
planned it so all those individuals

385
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,839
authoring their own content in digital

386
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,000
form could suddenly send their bits and

387
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,440
bites anywhere in the world basically

388
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,680
for free

389
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,680
it was that fiber optic explosion that

390
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,079
accidentally with nobody having planned

391
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,880
it made Beijing Bangalore and Boston all

392
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,920
nextd door neighbors how did it happen

393
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,440
well on the morning of 8995 Netscape

394
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,240
went public priced at

395
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,920
$28 their investment bankers Morgan

396
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,399
Stanley wanted the stock to be priced at

397
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,319
32 but Jim barkdale the Netscape CEO at

398
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,639
the time said no no no if this fails I

399
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:34,199
want it to be remembered as a $20 stock

400
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:37,160
Netscape opened that morning at $71

401
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,120
closed the first day at 56 and we all

402
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,440
looked at that and we said Woo there is

403
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,120
gold over them their Hills and we went

404
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,199
out and we we bought every.com that boom

405
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,160
that moved yeah we we bought every doc

406
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,399
that moved called Global Crossing and

407
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,199
Nexel and JDS uniface oh you can't fool

408
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,959
me I know it's in your 401ks I was born

409
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,040
at night it wasn't last night um and

410
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,600
when we did we accidentally funded the

411
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,519
massive over wirring of the world with

412
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,160
fiber optic cable so every individual

413
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,279
authoring content on their PC could

414
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,839
suddenly send their digital content

415
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,360
anywhere for free third key flattener

416
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,560
was a quiet Revolution it was a

417
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,000
revolution in transmission protocols

418
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,079
happened across the 199s it was the

419
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,519
alphabet soup of tcpip and HTML and HTTP

420
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,600
and XML and soap and HX you don't need

421
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,600
to know even though most people here do

422
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,440
what all that alphabet soup meant it

423
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,360
just meant one key thing for the

424
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,759
flattening of the world critical to to

425
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,759
this phenomena it meant everyone's

426
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:50,399
computer and software became

427
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:54,160
interoperable we forget today what a

428
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,759
revolution that was we forget today what

429
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,319
it was like when mit's Administration

430
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,920
first got computers and the bookkeeping

431
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,319
Department got rid of the Abacus and

432
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,640
adding machine they had down there and

433
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:07,280
got a computer and admissions got

434
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,839
computers a very exciting day around

435
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
here at MIT when that happened there

436
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,240
there was just one problem though

437
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,480
bookkeeping got sap and administration

438
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,480
got uh windows and uh they didn't

439
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
connect they didn't connect any more

440
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,360
than you were on your comp you serve

441
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,559
could connect with your wife on

442
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,679
AOL well what happened thanks to all

443
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,240
those transmission protocols is that we

444
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,440
made everyone's computer and software

445
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
interoperable it was a quiet Revolution

446
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,400
I call it the workflow Revolution

447
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,799
because it truly allowed work to flow

448
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,640
and when that happened when you could

449
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,440
suddenly sit at your computer terminal

450
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,600
or someone in India and not have to

451
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,280
think for a moment what is the computer

452
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,840
and software that open courseware is

453
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,120
running on and what computer and

454
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,200
software do I have what it meant was we

455
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,520
could all suddenly become

456
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,280
collaborators so put it all together

457
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
first I could author my own content in

458
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,000
digital form then I could send it

459
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,240
anywhere in the world for free and then

460
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,480
thanks to the workflow Revolution

461
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,799
suddenly everyone could collaborate with

462
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,080
everyone else on their digital content

463
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,000
what we created right around the year

464
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,159
2000 right around the time of the

465
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,520
Millennium was this crude flat world

466
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,799
platform a global platform for multiple

467
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,960
forms of collaboration suddenly more

468
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,000
people could collaborate with more other

469
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,000
people on more different kinds of things

470
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,799
in more different kinds of ways from

471
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,400
more different places for less money

472
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,960
than ever

473
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,880
before that is built on this platform

474
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,360
now this flat platform then gave rise to

475
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,559
a whole new set of collaborations

476
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,120
Outsourcing offshoring to me the most

477
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,559
interesting one which again is critical

478
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,200
to open courseware I call uploading a

479
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,240
term coined by Kevin Kelly of wired not

480
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,120
uploading in the conventional sense you

481
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,640
see when the world was round you

482
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,240
downloaded as an individual

483
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,400
but when the world is flat individuals

484
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,919
can now upload and globalize their own

485
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,360
content globally uploading comes in many

486
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,600
forms open- Source software is uh the

487
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,120
most was the most early variant and

488
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,600
probably still the most popular open

489
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,280
course software you just uploaded your

490
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,720
University

491
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,240
online uh blogging GE in the old days if

492
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,760
you wanted an opinion on Foreign Affairs

493
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,960
you had to read a fuddy duddy like me

494
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,679
not anymore now I go to Iraqi bloggers

495
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,120
see what they're uploading as

496
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,720
individuals from Baghdad when I want to

497
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,480
know what's going on there YouTube

498
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,400
uploading video and of course the mother

499
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,559
of all uploads

500
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,120
Wikipedia the people are now uploading

501
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,280
their own

502
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,320
encyclopedia now it's not

503
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,640
perfect all you have to do is be a

504
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,120
subject of Wikipedia to know how

505
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,760
imperfect it is okay and anyone who

506
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,159
thinks the network will get it all

507
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,640
straightened out um uh doesn't have

508
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,840
their biography on Wikipedia but never

509
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,120
mind we won't go there

510
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,240
um but the fact is we're going from a

511
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,880
world where when I grew up in

512
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,080
Minneapolis in the 1950s I remember when

513
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
the encyclopedia branica salesman came

514
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,760
to our house with all those books he was

515
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,679
so excited put them down in the living

516
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:27,400
room and then we got the coolest thing

517
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:30,919
we got incarta and you could download an

518
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:35,799
encyclopedia I think in carda 2007 had

519
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:39,720
about 38,000 entries wow Wikipedia today

520
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:44,400
has about 1.3 mil 840

521
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,440
846 and they'll have 847 real soon so

522
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,559
people aren't downloading their

523
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,080
encyclopedia they're now uploading it so

524
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,919
uploading is an incredibly new form of

525
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,760
creativity that sprung off this

526
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,320
platform now basically what happened

527
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,240
around the year 20

528
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,919
2000 is that all these flatteners

529
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,880
converged as I said and they converged

530
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,000
into a platform that is what I talk

531
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,440
about when I say the World is Flat when

532
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,600
I talk about the World is Flat I don't

533
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,960
mean it's equal I don't mean that

534
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,600
there's no more terms of trade I'm

535
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:23,320
talking about a platform that allows

536
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:26,279
individuals more equal ability to Plug

537
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,080
and Play compete connect and collaborate

538
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,039
globally and that's really what open

539
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,720
course

540
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,799
is an incredible manifestation of it's

541
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,360
living on this platform so we've really

542
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,039
gone from a world where value was

543
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,440
created in vertical silos of command and

544
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:44,159
control to a world where value is being

545
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,120
created horizontally on this platform by

546
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,200
who you connect and collaborate with

547
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,840
we're going from vertical to horizontal

548
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,679
I think that shift which is happening in

549
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,200
a million universities a million

550
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,559
businesses a million governments all

551
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,520
over the world is going to be seen in

552
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:05,120
time as the mother of all inflection

553
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,000
points we are going to from vertical to

554
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,520
horizontal and it in time is going to

555
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,480
change I believe

556
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,279
everything now there's sort of three

557
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,400
things I'd keep in mind about this new

558
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,960
platform the first is what I call the

559
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,799
iron rule of business on the flat R

560
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,200
platform and the iron rule of business

561
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,400
on the flat world platform is whatever

562
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,159
can be done will be

563
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,320
done when the world is flat

564
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:36,159
whatever can be done will be done the

565
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,919
only question the only question left is

566
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,159
will it be done by you or to

567
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:45,360
you just do not think it won't be done

568
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,039
promise me if you have a good idea here

569
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,039
at MIT you will do it because I promise

570
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:54,600
you someone at IIT Madras will have it a

571
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,320
second later when the world gets this

572
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:01,039
flat and there are this many distributed

573
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:05,159
tools of Conn ity and creativity at the

574
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:10,159
individual level whatever can be done

575
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:13,640
will be done now I see this everywhere I

576
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,960
go now and I'm not sure economics has

577
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,559
fully been able to capture what is

578
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,799
happening far below the firm level at

579
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,080
the individual level I call it gross

580
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:28,679
individual product because individuals

581
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,720
on this platform are now doing whatever

582
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,480
can be done my wife and I were in Peru

583
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,960
last year we're on ecotour our guide

584
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,919

International we're down in Rio tomoa he

587
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,240

588
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,200
stories says Tom I've got a friend I got

589
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,120
to tell he's selling Peruvian dish wear

590
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:51,200
now from a village near Cusco on the

591
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,120
internet great The World is Flat proen

592
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,919
village then he adds this he's checking

593
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,080
to see if he can get his dishes made

594
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:02,000
cheaper in China now okay why not if it

595
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,960
can be done it will be done and if he

596
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,480
doesn't do it the Villager in Cusco next

597
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,919
to him will do it whatever can be done

598
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:14,200
will be done I was out in uh Budapest a

599
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
year ago they did a seminar on the World

600

is Flat all these European scholars

601
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,120
screaming at me it was really

602
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,760
interesting and um uh they gave me a

603
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,919
driver when I got there and and he

604
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,159
stayed with me for three days and he

605
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600

with

624
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,080
music and suddenly I had this vision of

625
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,120
something secretary baker said to me

626
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,600
after he retired as Secretary State he

627
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,640
said how do you know you're out of power

628
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,279
in Washington DC Tom you know you're out

629
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,039

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:21,480
farsy okay um how do you know you're in

632
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:25,000
a flat world when your Hungarian cab

driver has his own website now in magar

634
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,320
German and English with music

635
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,080
I interview people everywhere I go so

636
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,039
I'm out in South Sous City Nebraska I

637
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,600
don't even remember I think I was

638
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,039
speaking at the University out there guy

639
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,559
picks me up at the airport so I like to

640
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,679
interview people wherever I am hi what

641
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,159
do you do he says well um I used to be

642
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,679
in the chocolate business imported

643
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,120
chocolates so you're from Nebraska but

644
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,159
Brazil could import them into this

645
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,279
country finished chocolates cheaper than

646
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,399
I could make them then we went into the

647
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,840
TAC business you know horses stuff China

648
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,000
came into that business wiped us out

649
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,360
what do you do now he says now what do

650
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,840
we do we import a machine from South

651
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,720
Korea that can be placed at building

652
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,200
sites that produces building sighing and

653
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,399
insulation together I don't know that

654
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,000
much about construction evidently

655
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:06,760
there's a great efficiency there we

656
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,640
import this machine we add a little IP

657
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,720
here from some folks in South City and

658
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,880
we reexport it to

659
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,200
Kuwait I said you're doing all that from

660
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,360
here yeah I said I said interesting I

661
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,440
mean how do you communicate with the

662
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,480
kuwaitis this is actually in the 3.0

663
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,480
edition of the book this is all I'm not

664
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,399
making this up folks um he says um well

665
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,279
you know we got the winnabago Indians

666
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:30,080
here in Wago Indian tribes and the

667
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,600
Winnebago Indians have a casino called

668
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,240
Winne Vegas and Winne Vegas spins off an

669
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,960
enormous amount of cash so the Winnebago

670
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,799
Indians from wnne Vegas created the

671
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,279
Winnebago Indian Development Corporation

672
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,600
which created an ad Agency for Winnebago

673
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:43,320
kids who went out and hired Arabic

674
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,039
speakers from the local University and

675
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,399
they write the brochure so we can import

676
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,240
the machine from South Korea add our IP

677
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:53,640
here they write the the uh the um uh

678
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,720
directions for it from the Winnebago

679
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,679
Indian Development Corporation and we

680
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,520
reexport it to Kuwait wait you show me

681
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,120
where that shows up in the economic

682
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,799
statistics I'm sure it does somewhere

683
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,880
but that is people doing whatever can be

684
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,679
done and so much of that is happening

685
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,200
today I see it everywhere I go which

686
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,399
leads to me the second rule of the flat

687
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,000
world platform and the second rule for

688
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,440
me is the most important economic

689
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,159
competition going forward in the world

690
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,799
today is I don't believe going to be

691
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,360
between countries and countries although

692
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,279
it's obviously still important it's even

693
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,960
going to be between companies and

694
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,120
companies although obviously still

695
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,279
important I think the most important

696
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,120
economic competition going forward is

697
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,120
going to be between you and your own

698
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,120
imagination because when you have a

699
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,240
world this flat and individuals are this

700
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,919
empowered to act on their own

701
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:53,240
imagination

702
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:55,760
globally what individuals imagine really

703
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,640
matters and therefore how well a

704
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,840
university a country a state school

705
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,399
inspires enables and empowers individual

706
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,000
imagination I think will be the single

707
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:09,279
greatest Competitive Edge in the world

708
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,880
we're going

709
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,480
into the third rule of this platform is

710
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,480
how well you

711
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
horizontalization learned this lesson

712
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,679
really right when I was starting to

713
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,360
write the book quite by accident I was

714
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,799
going to visit my daughter who was going

715
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,840
to school in New Haven Connecticut I

716
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,159
live in Bethesda Maryland to get from

717
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,880
Bethesda Maryland to New Haven

718
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,840
Connecticut is a complete pain in the

719
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,840
behind you have to drive almost an hour

720
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,799
to Baltimore Airport take Southwest

721
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,399
Airlines from Baltimore to Hartford

722
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,960
airport then drive one hour from

723
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,279
Hartford to New Haven I could almost go

724
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,679
to London quicker never mind I'm a

725
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:56,120
Southwest fan don't know many of you

726
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,840
have flown South sou Southwest but you

727
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,000
don't look like a Southwest crowd to me

728
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,799
but that's okay and Southwest Airlines

729
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,480
you know is El Cheapo Airlines you don't

730
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,159
get a reserve seat you just get a ticket

731
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,840
this is a b or c a's board first B's

732
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,279
Board second se's board last only thing

733
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,960
you need to know about Southwest

734
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,679
Airlines is you do not want to be a c on

735
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,159
Southwest Airlines especially if you

have two bags of spring clothing for

737
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,080

751
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,519
Cinnabon and sat in the back of the

752
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,240
beeline

753
00:29:53,519 --> 00:30:00,000
steing well 45 minutes went by and then

754
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:04,039
they called the flight and then I saw

755
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,480
it all the A's seemed to be getting

756
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:10,840
getting on caring what looked to me like

757
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,279
just crumpled white home printer

758
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,960
paper as if they had gone online at

759
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,679
12:01 a.m. the night before and

760
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,600
downloaded and printed out their own

761
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:25,519
barcodes and boarding passes well what I

762
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,600
didn't know back then was what Southwest

763
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,760
Airlines knew was that the world was

764
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,360
flat

765
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,679
and on this new platform they could

766
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,720
Empower their customers to go online and

767
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,519
download print out their own barcodes

768
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,840
and boarding passes and take up all the

769
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,919
a seats before Tom fredman got to the

770
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,159
airport oh I looked at that friends I

771
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,279
said fredman you are so 20th century I

772
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,279
mean really think you're so

773
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,559
globalization 1.0 globalization there

774
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,640
was a ticket agent I us to go down pull

775
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,960
the number thank you ma'am I'm going to

776
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
go to Baltimore then we got to eat

777
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,600
ticket machine we thought that was

778
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:01,200
cool and then while you were sleeping

779
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,639
you the individual became your own

780
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,639
ticket agent or to look at it another

781
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:07,679
way you the individual became an

782
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:10,000
employee of Southwest

783
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,120
Airlines or or look at it actually still

784
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,760
another way you the individual if you

785
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,720
value your own time staying up at 12:01

786
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,840
a.m. the night before are actually

787
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:24,639
paying Southwest Airlines to be their

788
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,720
employee have a nice day

789
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,080
okay so I get smart next time I stay up

790
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,799
till 12:01 a.m. I download my own

791
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,000
barcode and boarding pass I get to the

792
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,120
gate 35 minutes before the flight this

793
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,480
time because I've interacted with

794
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,039
Southwest Airlines horizontally now not

795
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,919
vertically and what happened I captured

796
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,960
60 Minutes of

797
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,799
productivity by interfacing with

798
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,880
Southwest Airlines on this platform

799
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,840
horizontally not vertically well that

800
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,320
move from vertical to horizontal it's

801
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,159
happening as I said on a million

802
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,639
campuses and a million businesses and

803
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,919
when we get to the other side of it and

804
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:04,200
the people who do it best are going to

805
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,880
capture enormous productivity think of

806
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,159
the productivity gains if you could

807
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:12,840
measure them of all these people

808
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,799
interacting with MIT horizontally not

809
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,639
vertically not getting on a plane coming

810
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,600
here to a lecture but interacting with

811
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,679
MIT horizontally I would be fascinated

812
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,799
if someone could actually measure the

813
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,200
incredible educational productivity gain

814
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,279
you've given birth to here so so those

815
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,200
are the to me the three rules of this

816
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,559
platform now that that means several

817
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,320
things I think for our society and how

818
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,720
we organize ourselves which makes the

819
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,600
current election campaign make you want

820
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,880
to really weep because it means it means

821
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,440
several things first of all I I I used

822
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,600
to be a free

823
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,960
Trader I'm I'm not anymore I have to

824
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,120
tell you I do not I'm not a free Trader

825
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:57,919
anymore now now I'm a radical free

826
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:02,080
Trader oh I'm a wild crazy paint on my

827
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:05,600
face radical free Trader because if

828
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,480
whatever can be done will be done and if

829
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,480
the greatest single Advantage is what

830
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,039
you can act on your individual

831
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,320
imagination who's going to win it's

832
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,120
going to be the most open society that

833
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,159
gets the signals first of what's being

834
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,840
done and empowers and enables its

835
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,320
citizens to react and do it before it's

836
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,799
done to them so just at a moment when we

837
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,000
have this incredible cultural Advantage

838
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:31,880
as a free trading Society we do not have

839
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,039
one single candidate basically in this

840
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,240
election campaign truly in a

841
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:41,080
full-throated way standing up for free

842
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:44,360
trade it is really in my view really

843
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,159
really dangerous I think the second rule

844
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,480
that you know I pull off this new

845
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,399
platform and um its new capabilities is

846
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,559
also what it means for

847
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:57,240
Education um I have to say I was a

848
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,159
always a fan of liberal arts um I'm an

849
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,679
even bigger fan of liberal arts today um

850
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,639
Lord knows what MIT does here on math

851
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,280
and science is irreplaceable um and is

852
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:12,359
one of the crown jewels of this

853
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,480
country but bringing liberal arts into

854
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,720
the equation is more important than ever

855
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,560
because we're in a world now where

856
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,079
imagination and mashups the ability to

857
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,399
mash things together through really

858
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,320
imaginative I think than you

859
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,879
is going to be such a huge advantage and

860
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,800
I don't know about you all but where my

861
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,240
imagination comes from is having two

862
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,200
different Specialties Arabic Middle East

863
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,760
history and globalization and technology

864
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,200
and mashing them

865
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,639
together I think educ inspiration

866
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,720
Innovation comes from having two or more

867
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,320
Specialties and applying the framework

868
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,879
of one specialty to the framework of

869
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,960
another and so it is great it is

870
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,920
essential it is critical we have people

871
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,599
who are expt exper at dots but we also

872
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,280
need as individuals and collectives to

873
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:08,280
be encouraging the connecting of those

874
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,440
dots and the mashing of them together

875
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,680
that is where inspiration comes from

876
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,960
Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist he was

877
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,760
an artist he was an inventor and that's

878
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,760
what made him special I always Point

879
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,560
people to Steve Jobs graduation speech

880
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,839
at Stanford a couple years ago where he

881
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,800
talked about where his own inspiration

882
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,200
came from for the max Steve went to Reed

883
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,640
College he dropped out like all Great

884
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,000
American entrepreneurs after one term

885
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,560
think about that Bill Gates Michael Dell

886
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,079
Steve Jobs all dropped out um but he had

887
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,119
nowhere to go so he hung around Reed

888
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:47,880
College and he had nothing to do so he

889
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,359
decided to take a course in

890
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,920
calligraphy and he learned the beauty of

891
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,720
typface of serif and San serif type and

892
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,359
10 years later he said it all went into

893
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,599
the Mac keyboard

894
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,319
the first Mac keyboard was exactly what

895
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,280
it was which had at that time the most

896
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:10,599
Innovative type face in Computing in

897
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,680
popular Computing because Steve Jobs

898
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,440
dropped out of Reed College and took a

899
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,280
course in

900
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,079
craphy I don't know if anyone's out

901
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,480
there looking for a job we are desperate

902
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,880
at the New York Times for engineers

903
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,520
they've asked me to actually make this

904
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,960
appeal we can't hire Engineers we no one

905
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,079
no one thinks we're cool we're not

906
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,720
Google I know but we're not that bad you

907
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,160
know but we would love if any of you

908
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,200
want to give me your card you're looking

909
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,200
for a job in engineering we'd love you

910
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,200
to come interview at the New York Times

911
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,040
but just one thing please don't come if

912
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,119

because we need people who can mash up

916
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,160
those things we can we can get Engineers

917
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,920
we can Outsource we can we can get

918
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,599
people to do programming we need people

919
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,680
who can really

920
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:07,680
imaginatively Mash those things together

921
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,520
so I'm these are the kind of things that

922
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm really looking at now as as I look

923
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,079
at America as I look at our election and

924
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:20,040
as I look at things that we

925
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:25,560
need I I'm still a big believer that we

926
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:27,839
have culturally so many things that work

927
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,440
for this new world

928
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,760
but we've kind of lost our

929
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,119
groove since

930
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,680
911 you I go around the world now and

931
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,400
you hear it everywhere people say you

932
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,160
know the 19th century belong to Britain

933
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,960
the 20th century belong to America and

934
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,800
the 21st century will belong to to

935
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,040
China and what's happening in China

936
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,119
today is truly impressive and what makes

937
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,119
it impressive is it's it's from hard

938
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,839
work and it's from the ground up and you

939
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,599
just cannot go there and not be

940
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:02,920
impressed at what China is

941
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:07,400
doing but I I'm just not quite ready to

942
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,560
seed the 21st century to anyone yet

943
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,240
because you know we're we're not going

944
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,240
to win it if we don't get our act

945
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,920
together and be smart about these

946
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,480
natural attributes we have free trade

947
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,359
Innovative culture we don't need to have

948
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,400
an hour of creativity class in this

949
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:26,000
country

950
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,880
okay but we need to get our act together

951
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,400
we cannot go on being dumb as as we want

952
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,680
to be and right now that is the motto of

953
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:39,280
the US Congress dumb as we want to be

954
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:43,200
okay Washington today is brain dead I am

955
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,319
talking about beep there isn't even a

956
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,920
okay brain dead as far as I'm concerned

957
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:52,319
both parties both houses the White House

958
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,480
brain dead but I have to tell you if

959
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:57,839
someone who is a reporter who spends a

960
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,839
lot of time out in the country thank God

961
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,520
our country is

962
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,119
alive because all these individuals I

963
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,760
should show you my desk boy I got a pile

964
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:07,920
here from energy entrepreneurs come see

965
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,400
my flywheel it turns a duck it jumps up

966
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,319
it makes you know methane I mean come to

967
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,119
my class another pile from Educators

968
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:16,480
we're teaching young women how to do

969
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,720
science and math in these really

970
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:25,040
innovative ways thank God our country is

971
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:28,119
alive if we had a government that was as

972
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,280
alive as the country no one would touch

973
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:35,680
us so I'm not ready to seed the 21st

974
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,280
century to anyone just yet because our

975
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,599
culture of creativity it's hard to

976
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,480
duplicate my grandmother in Minnesota

977
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,040
had a saying Grand Grandma fredman God

978
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,160
bless her she used to sit in her rocking

979
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,720
chair in the data winter and she would

980
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,319
say to me you know Tommy I I have to

981
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,119
tell you remember one thing said Grandma

982
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:56,520
fredman never seed a century to a

983
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,839
country that censors Google it was it

984
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,640
was just a

985
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:02,400
it was it was just a little thing

986
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,560
Grandma used to say

987
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,560
and sitting sitting by the fire so I'm

988
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,240
not ready to seed the 21st century yet

989
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,119
to anyone but I think a lot of who is

990
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,280
going to own the 21st century and I'm

991
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,040
going to close with this is really going

992
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:25,200
to be defined by who addresses this

993
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,640
clean power challenge this clean energy

994
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,079
challenge first best and most

995
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,760
productively and that's really the segue

996
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,079
to my next book Because when the world

997
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,839
is this

998
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:42,040
flat what's happening is three billion

999
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:44,319
new players God bless every one of them

1000
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,680
have come through through through

1001
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,680
portals like this to the flat world all

1002
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,280
with their own version of the American

1003
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,560
dream a house a car a toaster a

1004
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,359
microwave and a refrigerator if we don't

1005
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,920
find a

1006
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,920
cleaner more non-emitting way to power

1007
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,960
their dreams we are going to burn up

1008
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,000
choke up heat up and smoke up this

1009
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,280
planet so much faster than even Al Gore

1010
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,119
predicts okay so the flattening of the

1011
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,079
world is critical to

1012
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,119
this now everyone says you know oh but

1013
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,880
but but Mr freedan there's a Green

we're

1026
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,359
having is a revolution where nobody gets

1027
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:06,359
hurt you get to consume your way out of

1028
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:09,839

00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:12,720
that's a party we're having a green

1030
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,400
party and it's it's great fun I have to

1031
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,280
tell you I get invited to all the

1032
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,280
parties it's great

1033
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:25,400
fun I've never been to a revolution

1034
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,680
where no one got hurt many of you here

1035
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:33,160
attended drove and participated in the

1036
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:35,160
it Revolution that was a revolution it

1037
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,280
operated on the true business

1038
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:43,040
revolutionary principle change or die

1039
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,680
change or die Wayne computer data

1040
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,760
General Burrows they're not with us

1041
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,000
anymore they're in that great computer

1042
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,480
company heaven in the

1043
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
sky because they were in the middle of a

1044
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,280
real Revolution change or die

1045
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,920
the Green Revolution we're having is a

1046
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,520
complete fraud as far as I'm concerned

1047
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,480
because in this revolution everyone's

1048
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,240
green yeah exxon's Green BP's green I

1049
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,640
read there Beyond petroleum GM's green

1050
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,599
now they give you a little yellow cap

1051
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,480
you know on to put your flex fuel in

1052
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,559
they don't tell you you're driving a

1053
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,960
flex fuel car but never

1054
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:27,440
mind that's not a revolution that's a

1055
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:31,359
party and if we don't do what what it

1056
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,640
takes to sparkk a real revolution in a

1057
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:38,640
flat world the climate and energy

1058
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,880
impacts are going to swamp

1059
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,800
us I wrote about this a few weeks ago

1060
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,800
some of you may have seen by accident I

1061
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,559
happen to visit two cities you've

1062
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,440
probably never heard of two weeks apart

1063
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:54,200
I went to Iraq and on my way I stopped

1064
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,839
in dohaqatar capital of Qatar a tiny

1065
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,000
Peninsular State off the east coast of

1066
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,319
Saudi Arabia and 10 days later I went to

1067
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,160
dalan China now I have to have been to

1068
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:05,960
Doan and dalen several times but I

1069
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,839
hadn't been to either one for three

1070
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:13,359
years I go to Doha and what do I find I

1071
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:15,240
find I get off the plane I look downtown

1072
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,400
and they have grown a

1073
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,400
Manhattan a little mini Manhattan since

1074
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,119
I was there last like a wildf flower

1075
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,119
that sprouted from a desert rainstorm I

1076
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:28,319
just looked I said that you you have a

1077
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,040
Skyline now that's like that's like a

1078
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,440
little

1079
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,720
Manhattan two weeks later I go to dalan

1080
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,319
10 days later I see they already had a

1081
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,559
Manhattan they've added two more since I

1082
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:43,359
was there so I'm really glad you changed

1083
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,839
all the CFL your lights here from

1084
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:49,760
incandescent to compact

1085
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:52,839
fluorescent Doha and dalen ate that for

1086
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:58,800
breakfast oh no you got a Prius God

00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:13,880
green according to working woman

1091
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:17,040
magazine Doha and dalen snacked on that

1092
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:21,079
after dinner like so much

1093
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,680

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,160
years the global economy today friends

1097
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:35,359
is like a monster truck with the gas

1098
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:38,440
pedal stuck and we have lost the

1099
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,800
key and the only way we are going to

1100
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,680
catch that truck is with a

1101
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,920
disruptive

1102
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,599
breakthrough and the only way we're

1103
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,359
going to get a disruptive breakthrough

1104
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:54,599
is with a completely different mix of

1105
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:57,599
Standards regulations incentive and

1106
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,040
taxes that will trigger that

1107
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,040
disruption which is why my fundamental

1108
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,520
rule is change your leaders not your

1109
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:10,839
light bulbs oh it's great to change your

1110
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:13,920
light bulbs but if you don't change your

1111
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:18,000
leaders if you don't change the leaders

1112
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,640
who write the rules who trigger The

1113
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,400
Innovation we are

1114
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,440
cooked so what I've been trying to do in

1115
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,480
the new book I'm writing um

1116
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,119
is

1117
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,240
basically in my own little way to try to

1118
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,200
reshape how we think about this problem

1119
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,920
because we actually think we're having a

1120
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,119
revolution and we're actually having a

1121
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,119
party but one of the real problems in

1122
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:47,480
getting people to rethink this

1123
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,440
problem is getting them to rethink the

1124
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,880
meaning of

1125
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,040
green one of the big problems around

1126
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,920
green is that I'm a big believer to name

1127
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,200
something is to own it if you can name

1128
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,680
an issue you can own an issue The World

1129
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,119
is

1130
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:04,000
Flat and the problem with green is all

1131
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,000
these years it was named by its

1132
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,440
opponents basically they named it

1133
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,920
liberal tree hugging girly man

1134
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:19,680
unpatriotic vaguely French just vaguely

1135
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:23,280
French something about it vaguely French

1136
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:27,599
okay well what I'm really out to do is

1137
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:31,760
to rename green rename it geopolitical

1138
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:35,359
geostrategic economic capitalistic

1139
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:40,240
entrepreneurial patriotic green is the

1140
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,240
