1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,879
thank you for the invitation and the

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:09,480
introduction so I'll uh Jump Right

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:12,120
In so um as you can tell from the title

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,920
this is about reachable sets so

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,160
reachable sets I won't give a formal

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,680
definition because there are the

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,800
variations of that but primarily in this

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,279
talk we'll deal with a given dynamical

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,480
system a set of initial conditions and

10
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,039
typically we also include a set of

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,800
disturbances and the question is

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,679
starting with the initial set subject to

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,879
the disturbances where do you land what

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,040
are the possible behaviors so this is

15
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,719
important for verification of safety if

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,680
your reachable set excludes unsafe

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,440
behaviors that's a certificate of safety

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,800
we also do this as a stepping stone for

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,640
control synthesis or to find control

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,280
invariant sets which is important for

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,039
autonomy applications so one of the

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,840
things we do is use a symbol symbolic

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,680
abstraction of dynamical system by

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,960
splitting the state space into cells and

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,000
then use reability analysis from each

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,240
cell to see what other cells you can

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
land in and use that to create a finite

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,119
State

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,079
model so I won't go into the many

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,240
applications but autonomy has been one

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,360
of the driving applications This Is Us

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,280
uh trying some um a platoon of vehicles

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,720
in urban traffic uh the vehicles keeping

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,320
six meters from each other how is this

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,159
relevant so in the design of these

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,399
controllers we actually use model

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,040
predictive control but controlled

38
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,320
invariant sets are embedded into the

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,840
model predictive control in order to to

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,759
to um avoid unsafe

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,000
behaviors so um the problem with

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,880
standard methods for estimating

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,840
reachable sets and this has a long

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,360
history if you go back many decades uh

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,600
there's foundational work by

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,960
B secas on reachable sets and later on

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,520
variations of that in continuous time uh

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,480
which translate to Hilton jobi methods

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,640
those are very powerful for precisely

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,560
estimating reachable sets the problem is

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,239
that the more State variables you have

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,800
and this is increasingly the case with

53
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,440
the type of systems we're de dealing

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,200
with nowadays or they will not scale

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,480
well okay so in practice we need things

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,680
that can scale to large systems

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,000
and for doing so we found the idea of

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,239
sampling trajectory is very

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,840
useful so I'll show you several variance

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,920
of this but the main the common idea

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,879
among the different things I'll show you

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,800
is we generate sample trajectories by

63
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,000
High Fidelity simulation say and then we

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,800
see where those trajectories land okay

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,800
and then we try to reason about the

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,400
neighboring trajectories that did not

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,360
get sampled okay and so this is

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,680
basically a problem of

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,640
generalization and so you're trying to

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,239
generalize from samples to unsampled

71
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,879
neighboring trajector so we use

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,400
different methods for doing so uh one of

73
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,959
them you know questions how do we

74
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,120
generalize in one line of work we use

75
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,080
dynamical system properties to be able

76
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,239
to reason about what we haven't sampled

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,840
a Natural Choice you're here um with um

78
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,080
Jean Jac slotin so contraction theory is

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,400
one natural source if you knew some Bond

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
on how much trajector can diverge from

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,799
each other so contraction is a generic

82
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,439
name that also gives you growth bonds

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,840
right doesn't have to contract then you

84
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,720
can you can tell how far apart

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,640
neighboring trajectories can diverge

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,879
from sample trajectories and that can be

87
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,360
used as a way of um of uh covering

88
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,120
trajectories that you haven't sampled so

89
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,159
we did some related work in 2015 there

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,680
was couple of follow-ups um but the idea

91
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,319
there is clear basically taking

92
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,920
contraction ideas and turning them

93
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,120
turning them into algorithms no

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,959
foundational work on contraction Theory

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,959
itself um another line of work had to do

96
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680
with monotone systems these are order

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,000
preserving systems and a cartoon that

98
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,440
explains the main idea here uh is shown

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,320
in the middle so say you have a box of

100
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,240
initial conditions and the system

101
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,040
preserves order with respect to the

102
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,759
standard order right then if you

103
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,680
simulate trajectories from the two

104
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,000
extreme points the two extreme um

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,840
corners of the box wherever they land

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,600
because of the order preserving property

107
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
all of the trajectories in between will

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,440
be sandwiched between those so you get

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,199
get a natural bonding box okay so we

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
were able to extend this quite a bit

111
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,840
because monotonous the by itself is

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,560
quite restrictive but then we extend

113
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,840
this two class of systems that we call

114
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,479
mixed moton um so I'll give you a little

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,639
glimpse of that the first few slides and

116
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,400
now we'll switch to a learning approach

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,880
where we don't use any dynamical system

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,840
properties we just used generalization

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,759
in the statistical sense so we try to

120
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,120
develop probabilistic guarantees

121
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,319
of uh accuracy of a reach set that we

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,000
obtain from the samples okay so that

123
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,440
will be the buk of this

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,039
talk um so this book that you see on the

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,360
right uh summarizes most of the earlier

126
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,440
work not going so much into the uh

127
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,240
sampling and probabilistic Bounds okay

128
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,039
so we'll start with the what we call

129
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,720
interval reability analysis because we

130
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,080
are using these um axis aligned

131
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,160
intervals hyper um hyper boxes if you

132
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,560
want to call them or hyper intervals um

133
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,360
so let's start with that and I'll show

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,319
you the connections to monotonist but

135
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,319
what we'll present is a lot more General

136
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,120
than monotonicity so let's say we are

137
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,600
given a dynamical system defined by

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,280
differential equation like the one you

139
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,199
see at the top and the let's call the

140
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:14,120
the solution map at time T starting at

141
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,840
time t0 F subt okay this is a nonlinear

142
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,440
dynamical system so we don't know the

143
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,319
solution map so the reachable set from

144
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
that from a set of initial conditions

145
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,599
the box that you see on the left is

146
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:31,120
going to be the image of that box under

147
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,800
the uh solution map which you don't know

148
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,280
we're not going to know that exact shape

149
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,400
but the idea is can we quickly with very

150
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,759
light computation find a bonding box

151
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,440
over it and like I said before if you

152
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,800
have a monotone system in the strict

153
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,759
sense that preserves orders you would

154
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,720
just take X underscore look at the image

155
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,280
of that under the solution map by simply

156
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,280
integrating the differential equation

157
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,840
that would give you the lower corner and

158
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,639
now you'll do the same thing for the the

159
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,000
x x over bar and that will give you the

160
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,000
upper corner of the bonding box it would

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,039
be very simple what we are doing is a

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
little more General than that so the

163
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,960
main condition we're asking for is not

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,560
monotonicity although it encompasses

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,639
monotonicity as a special case so assume

166
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,639
that there you can find a constant

167
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,000
Matrix K such that the Jacobian of the

168
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,759
solution map which is denoted as partial

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,599
FD partial X Plus that constant Matrix

170
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,280
is s stable s stable means that even

171
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,160
though the entries depend on X their

172
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,960
signs do not change they're either all

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,680
positive or negative okay so the claim

174
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,599
is that under that condition you can

175
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,800
find the find the bonding box

176
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,479
efficiently uh you can basically find

177
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,319
the corners of the bonding Box by

178
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,960
evaluating

179
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,759
functions for only these upper and lower

180
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,199
points xcore and xar okay the little f

181
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,000
is derived from the actual solution map

182
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,479
and I will tell you what it looks like

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,879
in the next slide but the idea is that

184
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:09,520
you can just do two simulations to be

185
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,919
able to bond uh the actual

186
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,720
reset okay now the simplest case here is

187
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:20,840
when that Matrix K is

188
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:23,639
zero and the sign stability is consists

189
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,520
of all non- negative signs okay imagine

190
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,360
the Jacobian has all non- negative signs

191
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,639
that means the system is monotone it's

192
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,159
order preserving it's an increasing

193
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,320
function of every variable okay in that

194
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
case that little F that we use for

195
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,719
bonding the for finding the bonding box

196
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,640
is very simple it's the solution itself

197
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,560
you evaluate the solution big ft at

198
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,880
xcore to get the lower Bond and you

199
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,080
evaluate at xar to get the upper B very

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,160
simple right so this theorem is

201
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,440
extending this idea first it doesn't

202
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,720
need all positive entries it can have a

203
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,440
mix of signs okay second even if you

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,920
have entries that change sign if those

205
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,040
entries are either upper bonded or lower

206
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,519
bonded you can add a correction term in

207
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,399
the form of that constant Matrix if you

208
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,720
have a lower bond that goes negative you

209
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,959
can put a positive K entry in K to push

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,240
it up so it's always non- negative and

211
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:24,120
vice versa okay very simple idea um

212
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,320
so in the general case where you have

213
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,800
mixed signs and the Matrix K to make it

214
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,959
mixed signs um the little F function

215
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
takes the form that's explained here I'm

216
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,040
not going to go into the details but

217
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,079
let's perhaps look at the case where K

218
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,760
is equal to zero that's more informative

219
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,600
then what you're doing there again the

220
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,519
little F consists of the big F which is

221
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,480
the solution map and you're looking at

222
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,600
the entries if the dependence on an

223
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,959
entry has a negative sign the derivative

224
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,040
right then what you do is for the lower

225
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:04,000
end you enter the upper Bond

226
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,360
of the initial sets bonding box right

227
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,680
because the dependence is in the

228
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
opposite direction you're increasing

229
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,440
with respect to this variable so you're

230
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,839
mixing and matching the entries you put

231
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,680
in but at the end of the day all entries

232
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,240
you know the little function f comes

233
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,880
from the big solution map and you're

234
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,240
only evaluating it at a combination of

235
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,200
the uh the vertices okay and finally if

236
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,000
you need if you need to use that

237
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,120
constant Matrix K that creates an

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,920
additional term in the function little F

239
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,320
okay so that's the main idea um here's

240
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,720
the problem though so basically what I

241
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,639
explained here assume that you can find

242
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,079
a constant Matrix K such that the jobian

243
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,360
plus that constant Matrix becomes sign

244
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,920
stable being able to find such a

245
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,519
constant means that you either have

246
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,279
upper bonds or lower Bonds on each entry

247
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,800
of the Jacobian right so that's the main

248
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,360
underlying assumption here how can I do

249
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,959
that because in the first place I don't

250
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,920
even know the solution map we are

251
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,200
dealing with a nonlinear system ft is

252
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,279
unknown in addition of course you don't

253
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,600
know the Jacobian of that okay but we

254
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,800
can actually

255
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,000
evaluate both the solution map and the

256
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,760
Jovian of that map for a given point how

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,680
do we do that we just integrate the

258
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,279
differential equations of course that's

259
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,839
clear uh for the solution map itself

260
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,440
you're integrating the differential

261
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,920
equation from X and what comes out is

262
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,920
the the solution at time t uh for the

263
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Jacobian we have the notion of

264
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,839
sensitivity right what is the

265
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,600
sensitivity of an of a solution to

266
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,320
initial conditions if you pick a you

267
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,000
know standard book on differential

268
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,880
equations they'll tell you that you can

269
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,720
also append the differential equations

270
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,120
with the sensitivity equations integrate

271
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,760
them and that will give you basically

272
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,560
the Jacobian of the solution map so we

273
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,760
can do this run these two in parallel

274
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,240
and obtain both the solution map and the

275
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,040
Jacobian for a fixed given point right

276
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,000
but that's not enough for bonding the

277
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,639
whole jacobia so how do we do that so we

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,160
have a few methods each one has its um

279
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,519
limitations and advantages the first one

280
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,000
is one where we look at the sensitivity

281
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,880
equation and we realize that it looks

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,399
like a you know time varing Matrix times

283
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,040
the sensitivity m Matrix S right so it

284
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,639
looks like a linear time wearing model

285
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,399
okay and if you can cover the jobian

286
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,199
that's entering in the sensitivity

287
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,600
equation with an interval

288
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,760
Matrix then you can use interval

289
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,279
arithmetics to get a bond on the

290
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,800
solution of that sensitivity equation

291
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,079
okay there are ways of doing that uh it

292
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:58,040
goes back to the PHD thesis of Maas alov

293
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,320
at Technical University of Munich some

294
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,600
years ago and so you can do this and get

295
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,480
a solid Bond on the Jacobian that is not

296
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
going to depend on X and that's

297
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,519
basically what we were looking for but

298
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,360
as you can imagine that tends to give

299
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,880
you very conservative

300
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,399
bonds so that's the downside of that but

301
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,079
it's a sound method so you get a you

302
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,120
know you get a bond that's correct the

303
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,680
other solution is uh relaxing the

304
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,519
sunness a little bit so you can just

305
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,199
take a bunch of initial conditions

306
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,600
integrate those differential equations

307
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,199
and you get you evaluate the Jacobian

308
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,079
for all of those and then you take the

309
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:40,360
maximum you found or the minimum you

310
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,880
found for each entry to find your K of

311
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,360
course there you've lost soundness

312
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,279
because you you know the actual maximum

313
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,040
or minimum may happen at points that you

314
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,440
did not integrate right uh on the other

315
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,839
hand you get non-conservative bonds so

316
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,160
that's another end of the tradeoff and

317
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,360
we also came up with a in between

318
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,000
solution a high approach so to speak uh

319
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,440
that has the benefits of both Solutions

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,600
it is sound you get a guaranteed Bond

321
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,680
and um it is not conservative if you

322
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,800
take many

323
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,320
samples uh but on the other hand the

324
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,920
computational cost of that is a little

325
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,720
higher than the first two so what we do

326
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,519
here is actually a simple idea although

327
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,720
the equations grow so the idea is to go

328
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,600
one step lower in doing this interval

329
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,720
arithmetics which is conservative right

330
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,440
instead of using interval arithmetics to

331
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,759
bond the Jacobian we look at the

332
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,639
derivative of the Jacobian the second

333
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:42,160
sensitivity of the solution so to speak

334
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,560
which I denote as s XX second derivative

335
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,399
right now I'm going to use the interval

336
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,279
arithmetics to bond the second

337
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,839
derivative okay even if it's

338
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,079
conservative I don't care that much

339
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:58,720
because the only purpose of that bond is

340
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:00,399
to is to find the bond between this the

341
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
points that I've been sampling for the

342
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,240
Jacobian right my goal is to bond the

343
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,560
Jacobian I take

344
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,399
samples and I want to to make sure that

345
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,959
in between the samples you know I grow

346
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,759
the bond so that nothing can escape

347
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,160
right so for that in between Behavior I

348
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,759
use the second derivative Bond even that

349
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,680
if that's conservative if my samples are

350
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,360
dense enough the resulting Bond I get on

351
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,240
the Jacobian itself will not be

352
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,680
conservative okay and turns out you can

353
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,079
generate the second sensitivity through

354
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,079
an equation like this um but again as

355
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,279
you can imagine that leads to more

356
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,920
computational time

357
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,759
required so here's a very simple example

358
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,480
comparing all the things I mentioned um

359
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,480
the first method we talked about that I

360
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,839
said is conservative so this is a third

361
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,480
order system the unicycle model uh we

362
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,959
only looking at a projection into the

363
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,759
first two State variables um so the red

364
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,600
one that you see is the result of method

365
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,519
one it's a little

366
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,440
conservative um method two has no

367
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,720
guarantees but it works um it gives you

368
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,079
the blue box that looks like the

369
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,800
tightest and method three how

370
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,480
conservative it is depends on how many

371
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,399
samples you're taking like I said The

372
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,600
more samples you take the tighter it

373
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,319
will get um it starts pretty bad if you

374
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,720
start with one sample that's even worse

375
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:28,000
than the first method but the you the

376
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,279
the finer you make your Grid it's going

377
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,240
to get closer and cl closer to uh the

378
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,959
least conservative method too okay so

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,120
this is just to illustrate the ideas um

380
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,440
of using

381
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,319
monotonicity basically without requiring

382
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,279
the traditional uh definition of

383
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:49,800
monotonicity relaxing it in multiple

384
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,160
ways so while we were playing with this

385
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,440
we realized that you know the method two

386
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,920
which is sampling base and doesn't give

387
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,920
us guarantees is the is the one that has

388
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,800
the cheapest computation and gives us

389
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,639
the tightest bonds but no guarantees so

390
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,439
there was a student at the time who had

391
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,520
just started Alex stport and I told him

392
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,959
maybe we should look at that method more

393
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,199
closely and try to give some

394
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,400
probabilistic guarantees of of our bonds

395
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,600
on the Jacobian and he asked a very good

396
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,319
question he said you know if you're

397
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,439
happy with problemistic bonds why don't

398
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,000
you just simulate trajectories

399
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,039
themselves rather than doing that to

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,199
find a bond on the Jacobian and plugging

401
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,200
it back into your favorite method it's

402
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:34,559
too convol let's just simulate the

403
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,320
trajectories try to bond where they land

404
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,480
with appropriate sets and derive

405
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,160
statistical guarantees for the accuracy

406
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,880
of that estimate of the reset so that's

407
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,480
essentially what I'm going to present

408
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,960
next I told him you should do that and

409
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,760
that's the rest of my talk pretty much

410
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,039
so we're going to talk about a data

411
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,919
driven reachability method again this

412
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:57,400
time we don't need any information about

413
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,120
the model other than the ability to

414
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,120
integrate the model to get sample

415
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,360
trajectories therefore the model could

416
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,960
be arbitrarily complex High Fidelity

417
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,919
whatnot

418
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,640
okay so this is Illustrated in this styz

419
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,760
picture you have the initial set the

420
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:20,679
solution map ft Maps you to this orange

421
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,640
shape okay and in this first version of

422
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,000
what I'm going to present our goal is to

423
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,679
approximate that with a norm ball and

424
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,080
later on we'll lift that Norm ball

425
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,120
restriction we'll make it a lot more

426
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,159
General but I think for a first path

427
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,679
Norm ball makes it easy to understand so

428
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,960
what we do is we attach a probability

429
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,520
distribution to the initial set a

430
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,760
distribution whose support is the

431
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,480
initial set um this may have physical

432
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,840
meaning perhaps you know some statistics

433
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,960
about where the initial conditions are

434
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,799
going to come from or if nothing else it

435
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,640
could be just something you made up

436
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,440
maybe a uniform distribution over that

437
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,400
set which only serves as a rule to draw

438
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,039
samp

439
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,960
okay so we attach that distribution to

440
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:11,039
the initial set and under the solution

441
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,840
map F that get maps to a new

442
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,720
distribution okay and the support of

443
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,880
that final distribution is the exact

444
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,240
reachable

445
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,799
set okay now we're not going to go know

446
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,480
that exact reachable set because we

447
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,240
don't know the solution map so we're not

448
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,440
going to know the final distribution

449
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,039
either but we have the ability to draw

450
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,440
random samples from that final

451
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,520
distribution by drawing samples from the

452
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,720
initial distribution and

453
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,440
integrating indirectly right so that's

454
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,960
the whole idea so we take random samples

455
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,600
from the initial say integrate that

456
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,240
amounts to selecting uh random samples

457
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,120
from the final distribution and we use

458
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,360
that to approximate the support of that

459
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,960
okay so starting out with the normal

460
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,159
estimates what of course you can always

461
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,600
if your goal is to bond the reachable

462
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,720
set you can take the whole space or a

463
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,080
hugely conservative set but that defeats

464
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,840
the purpose the purpose is to have a

465
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,760
tight uh approximate of the Reet so then

466
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,280
our goal is to find the smallest

467
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,600
possible Norm

468
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,360
ball where the center of the ball B is a

469
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,240
decision variable and the shape that's

470
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,480
encoded in The Matrix a is also a

471
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,880
decision

472
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,000
variable um

473
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,240
so

474
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
that that normal captures one minus

475
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,679
Epsilon of the probability mass of the

476
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,520
final distribution and that's our

477
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,240
measure of how much we've captured the

478
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:49,200
actual reachable set okay and Epsilon

479
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,200
here is a user specified accuracy

480
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,039
parameter you want to capture 99% of the

481
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,159
reachable set fine you take Epsilon to

482
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:59,840
be 01 okay so the B the Norms you're

483
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,520
dealing with I did not restrict them

484
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,600
they could be two Norm one Norm whatever

485
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,559
you like if you use infinite Norms uh

486
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,000
then you're going to get box shapes if

487
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:13,480
you use infinite norms and the diagonal

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,240
a you're going to get axis ofine boxes

489
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,480
which ties in with the interval methods

490
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,159
that I was talking about

491
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,320
earlier so the problem we want to solve

492
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,400
then is a chance constraint optimization

493
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,840
problem you want to minimize the volume

494
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,360
of a norm Ball parameterized by this

495
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,559
Matrix and the Center Vector which let's

496
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,360
call them Theta collectively subject to

497
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,520
the constraint that the probability Mass

498
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,080
captured by that is is at least one

499
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,520
minus Epsilon okay again this is not

500
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,640
something you can solve you don't know

501
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,840
that distribution but we can relax it

502
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,279
with scenario optimization that means

503
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,039
you're going to take random samples

504
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,200
integrate therefore you've taken samples

505
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,440
from the final

506
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,480
distribution and you now minimize the

507
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,600
volume of that um normal subject to

508
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,440
capturing all the samples okay the idea

509
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,240
is very simple uh the more technical

510
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,600
part is in in obtaining some sample

511
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,720
complexity bonds uh telling us how many

512
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,679
samples we should take so that we can

513
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,000
give give guarantees that is required by

514
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,720
the original problem and we'll come back

515
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,960
to that um just to break it down into a

516
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,679
simple optimization problem if you were

517
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,279
dealing with two Norms you could use the

518
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,760
log determinant of a as a volume proxy

519
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,360
for the norm

520
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,720
ball and then your constraints will of

521
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,679
course be that the Matrix a be positive

522
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,120
definite so it gives you compact sets

523
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,760
and all of the samples samples being the

524
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,919
successors of the initial the samples

525
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,600
you selected from the initial set um are

526
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,640
captured inside the ball and everything

527
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,600
is written as this simple convex

528
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,640
optimization problem okay now again okay

529
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,000
this spits out an answer what can I say

530
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:06,240
about the the resulting set how accurate

531
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,279
is it or is it going to match the 1us

532
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,880
Epson accuracy bond that is desired well

533
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,480
that depends on how many samples you've

534
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,279
selected there's vast literature on

535
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,080
scenario optimization and Sample

536
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,640
complexity bonds so we're not deriving

537
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,159
anything new here we're just adapting

538
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,679
them to this problem so what we would

539
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,320
like to be able to say is the Shaded

540
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,240
expression at the very bottom we'd like

541
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,840
to say that our estimate which we call R

542
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:36,279
hat obtains from the samples captures 1

543
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,880
minus Epsilon of the actual probability

544
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:41,080
Mass question is how many samples should

545
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,159
I take to guarantee that turns out

546
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,400
there's no number of samples that can

547
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,240
ever give you that guarantee because

548
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,720
your samples could come you know you

549
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,240
could be unlucky that day or you may

550
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,799
draw samples from only a small section

551
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,080
of the initial set and they will of

552
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,679
course land to a small section of the

553
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,320
the ACT reach that and you can never

554
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,279
capture 1 minus Epsilon right so any

555
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,159
statement like this has to be

556
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,279
qualified with another probability Bond

557
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:15,159
on the confidence in that statement

558
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:17,720
which is standard in in this literature

559
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,640
so the outer probability at the bottom

560
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,520
is the confidence basic you're saying I

561
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,480
capture 1 minus Epsilon and I'm 1 minus

562
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,600
Delta confident in saying that okay you

563
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,960
know Delta is basically guarding again

564
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,360
drawing ly samples okay so given the

565
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,919
accuracy level defined by Epsilon and

566
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,360
the confidence level defined by Delta

567
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,360
the formula that you see at the top and

568
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,520
there are so many variants of this but

569
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
usually they look alike you know in

570
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,720
terms of the logarithmic dependence on

571
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,399
the confidence and so on um so if you

572
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,080
take that many samples you'll guarantee

573
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:57,880
um the bond that's at the bottom

574
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,679
okay so n little n here big n is the

575
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,000
number of samples you need to collect

576
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:06,080
little n is the state Dimension okay as

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,360
you can see the growth in the state

578
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,080
number of states is pretty mild and

579
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,080
square and that's why we are pursuing

580
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,159
these sampling based methods because we

581
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,440
want to be able to scale up to large

582
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,960
systems uh where is that number coming

583
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,840
from it's basically the number of

584
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,679
decision variables there we had the

585
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:27,960
Matrix a n byn but it's symmetric so

586
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,840
it's half of n² plus the diagonals right

587
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,240
and then and we have the center uh point

588
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,760
B that adds another n so that's why you

589
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,960
have that number over there looking like

590
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,960
n s + 3 n if you are really worried

591
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,120
about

592
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,320
this quadratic growth in N you could

593
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,120
actually restrict your choices for

594
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,559
example in the very extreme case I'm not

595
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,399
saying you should do this but if you

596
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:55,039
really wanted an order of one growth you

597
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:58,000
could just take your a to be a number to

598
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,679
be decided times identity and B to be

599
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,640
zero that means you're looking at ball

600
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:07,159
you know actual balls right um spheres

601
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,480
that are centered at the origin of

602
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,520
course the estimate will be very

603
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,520
conservative but you know the now

604
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,559
there's only one one parameter to choose

605
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,559
so it's order of one if you want order

606
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:21,720
of n rather than n squ then you can

607
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:23,679
choose your a to be diagonal that's

608
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,520
going to make your Norm balls axis

609
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,720
aligned which again creates conservatism

610
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,000
but again it's order of n so that's

611
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,320
Illustrated in the middle and if you're

612
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,799
flexible can explore different axes then

613
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,279
you choose a fully populated A and B

614
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,799
then it's order of n

615
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,080
Square here is the low Chic oscillator

616
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,080
which is something we tested these ideas

617
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,480
on so the first one is illustrating how

618
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,600
many samples you would need I I'm

619
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,480
guessing Epsilon in this case is 10^ -2

620
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,720
and Delta is 109 confidence is cheap

621
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,600
because it enters logarithm of 1/ Delta

622
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,320
um that's the number that we typically

623
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,000
use in the examples so the first one

624
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,919
requires the least number of samples and

625
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,880
in the second one we get an AIS aligned

626
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,200
ball in the other one it's a little

627
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,240
squished okay and the number of samples

628
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,679
accordingly are increasing now the

629
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,360
difference between the three cases is

630
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,799
not very dramatic here because this is

631
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,200
only a system with three state variables

632
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,159
right so you know quadratic versus

633
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,360
linear is not a big

634
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,000
deal um okay

635
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,919
so now so far we talked yes quick

636
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,480
question so the bounds that you just

637
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,720
showed are independent of the function

638
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,399
the F function that defines the

639
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,600
differential equation that's correct and

640
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,840
do you need any assumptions on F no no

641
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,600
lip Shi nothing I mean some people use

642
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,640
lipes types of bonds to be able to

643
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,200
eliminate this alter confidence thingy

644
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,159
but um we don't need know of

645
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,080
that so let's now generalize Beyond Norm

646
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,960
balls so really there's nothing special

647
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:03,000
about the norm ball all we need is to

648
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,200
use approximating sets of this form as

649
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,200
suev sets of a parameterized set of

650
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,880
functions okay a function G of the state

651
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,640
and parameters to be decided okay and

652
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,679
let's say we're using the zero subev

653
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,039
sets of that as our reset estimators so

654
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,480
to be able to turn this into an

655
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:24,240
optimization problem we'll need a volume

656
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,279
proxy so we assume that whatever

657
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,399
function G we're using for it zero subl

658
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,600
set we have some way of gauging its

659
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:33,360
volume okay that's what's the volume

660
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,919
function means it's just the proxy like

661
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,640
just like the log determinant we were

662
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,440
using before and normal is of course a

663
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,480
special case of that if you define your

664
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,760
function G as shown there and Theta to

665
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,159
be the decision variables a and volume

666
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,440
of data being negative log determinant

667
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:56,039
of a so with that you can actually do

668
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,080
much more interesting reachable set

669
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:00,919
estimates um and the optimization is

670
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,120
pretty much unchanged you're looking for

671
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,600
the data that minimizes the volume

672
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,440
subject to the subev set containing all

673
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,240
the samples you

674
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,880
selected so it's a convex problem if the

675
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,679
the volume proxy function is a convex

676
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,080
function of theta and if the function G

677
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,320
whose zero subev sets we're using as re

678
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,080
set estimates are convex in Theta but

679
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,279
not convex in Theta I'm not asking for

680
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,880
convexity with respect to the state

681
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:33,120
therefore the suble level sets don't

682
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,559
need to be convex at all but convexity

683
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,240
in Thea is required under those

684
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:41,240
conditions not only do you get a convex

685
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,760
optimization problem but also the sample

686
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,399
complexity bond that we saw before still

687
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,440
applies uh same formula except that we

688
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,480
have n subeta number of decision

689
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,240
variables and that was you know this

690
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,880
number before because the decision

691
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,240
variables was the N byn Matrix plus a

692
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,640
vector um so here's an example of the

693
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,320
types of things you can do with this

694
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,519
generalized formulation for example you

695
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,960
can split your States region of interest

696
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:12,000
in the state space that you know will

697
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,559
contain your samples and break it into

698
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,559
cells in in this case think of it as

699
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,120
tiles or boxes right the algorithm

700
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:22,840
you're using is the simplest thing that

701
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,200
anybody could imagine um you know

702
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,760
Elementary School student could possibly

703
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,480
come with this if you explain to them

704
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,000
what the legibility is

705
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,720
so you run a bunch of simulations from

706
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,080
samples if a tile gets hit you include

707
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,000
that tile in your estimate if a tile

708
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,360
doesn't get hit you leave it out

709
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,919
algorithmically it's as simple as that

710
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,360
now we have to dress this up a little

711
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,159
bit mathematically and formulate a

712
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,320
function G and volume proxy so we can

713
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,279
apply our sample complexity theorem okay

714
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,080
not for the algorithm itself uh it's

715
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:59,799
straightforward you can Define these um

716
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,679
indicator function for each cell for

717
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,120
each tile and then multiply them by a

718
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,519
coefficient Theta which is the decision

719
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,279
variable and the way youve defined it

720
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:16,760
for the sub zero sub Lev set to coincide

721
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:18,559
with the tiles that got hit you um

722
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,679
basically Theta needs to be zero right

723
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,000
the Theta for a cell needs to be zero so

724
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:27,440
that the Subzero suev zero sub Lev set

725
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,080
is included and with that of course you

726
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,559
want add as few tiles as possible to be

727
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,399
included and you can encode this in this

728
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:39,519
volume estimate using one minus data

729
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,480
because that way if data is zero it's

730
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,080
bigger so it's a penalty and you're

731
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,399
trying to minimize that

732
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,279
okay do you have any questions up to

733
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:54,039
this point maybe I can briefly pause yes

734
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:56,320
so the first method based on Norm balls

735
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:59,200
would suggest you know maybe a Next Step

736
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,960
would be to construct an open cover

737
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,919
where you're choosing the shape or the

738
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,240
size of the balls and also the location

739
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,399
you guys considered that I mean I

740
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,840
imagine this is simpler in terms of

741
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,919
complexity

742
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,399
because you don't have those extra

743
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,480
decision

744
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,120
variables pre- partition your have you

745
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:24,120
thought about the open cover approach no

746
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,159
I don't think we have yeah so the extent

747
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,159
of what we considered is already in the

748
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,159
slides

749
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:38,240
yes so like what

750
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,240
howle complexity depend

751
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,919
on it doesn't because we just choose

752
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,279
that right I mean it's a fixed

753
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,919
number so when

754
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:55,159
you

755
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,000
comp a constant yes so like but for

756
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:59,840
example for different kind of damic

757
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,840
system for

758
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,120
yeah I mean these bonds will inevitably

759
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,360
be conservative because they are not

760
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,039
using any information about the Dynamics

761
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,919
nor the period of integration yes I mean

762
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,639
that's the Holy Grail you would like to

763
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,159
be able to incorporate that knowledge as

764
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:21,440
well I think that's something that

765
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,639
people should think about but we want to

766
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,200
start at this level just statistical

767
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:28,840
generalization from samples and not

768
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,399
using any knowledge about Dynamics

769
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,120
so that's basically limited setup here

770
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:36,000
let me continue so I don't run out of

771
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,440
time but I will go faster so we have

772
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,720
more time for question um so like I said

773
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,039
here the function G needs to be convex

774
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,200
in Theta but not in X that allows

775
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:51,039
non-convex Subzero zero subev sets but

776
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,279
wouldn't it be nice to also eliminate

777
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,960
the convexity Assumption on Theta if we

778
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,880
could do that then we could use more

779
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,200
interesting functions such as sums of

780
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,360
radial basis functions and their Subzero

781
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,480
level sets if you look at the typical

782
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,919
expression for that you will see that

783
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,720
the parameter Sigma mu um and the

784
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:14,240
threshold gamma actually enter in a

785
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:17,079
non-convex way not Sigma but the others

786
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,159
do um and then the volume proxy in this

787
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:23,359
case is the sum of the sigma squares

788
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:27,720
right so um radial basis functions are

789
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:30,399
commonly used uh for bonding uh sets so

790
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,280
we want to be able to use them so to be

791
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,079
able to eliminate this convexity

792
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,560
assumption on the parameters we turn to

793
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,119
this so-called weight and judge approach

794
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,679
in a paper by compy and grati who are

795
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,440
scenario optimization guys and using

796
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,679
their method we were a able to eliminate

797
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,960
their convexity requirement and B

798
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,520
dramatically improve the sample

799
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,040
complexity bonds there's a drawback

800
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,720
though now you can't a prior say I need

801
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,800
this many s and this level of accuracy

802
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,320
will be guaranteed that you can't do

803
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,680
that what you do that's why it's called

804
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,599
weight and judge so what you're doing

805
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,400
now is you're taking samples in batches

806
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:13,160
okay getting your approximation you

807
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,640
still don't know what the accuracy level

808
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,359
is but given the confidence you

809
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,480
want

810
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,000
and given one more piece of information

811
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,520
which is how many of the samples you've

812
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,359
selected are essential to the

813
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,960
optimization problem in the sense that

814
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,800
if you yank them out the solution of the

815
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,760
optimization problem changes okay so

816
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,560
those are called support scenarios and

817
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,920
the number of the support scenarios and

818
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,680
the confidence level then give you an

819
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,359
Epsilon the accuracy Bond okay so you

820
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,800
you collect a batch do all of this find

821
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,960
an Epsilon if you're happy you stop if

822
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,720
you if it's larger than what you wanted

823
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,880
you collect more samples continue okay

824
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,319
although it's a little more tedious at

825
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,520
the end of the day if you look at how

826
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:02,680
many samples you needed to guarantee a

827
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,480
certain Epsilon you'll be much happier

828
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,079
with the total number than the

829
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,760
Alternatives you saw before where you

830
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,520
committed ahead of time okay much more

831
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,280
efficient uh sample complexity wise

832
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:18,319
here's a simple illustration is a six

833
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,839
State quador model again you're only

834
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:22,640
looking at a projection onto the two

835
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:26,880
dimensional space in one case you're

836
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,839
looking at again this Union of intervals

837
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,280
in the other case you're looking at a

838
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,960
Union sub level set of a sum of three um

839
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,880
radial basis

840
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,319
functions and the number of samples you

841
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,760
end up with and the resulting accuracy

842
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,160
levels are listed in this table just to

843
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,160
give you an

844
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,680
indication okay so this is a bit of an

845
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,119
intermo so we'll talk about an example

846
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,800
uh to illustrate some of the things

847
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,800
we've seen before this was a model that

848
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,680
we were playing with for a while I don't

849
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,079
work on exoskeletons really but there

850
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:09,599
was a student who was set on uh working

851
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:12,319
on those so what we did was to derive a

852
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,280
controller for the sit to stand motion

853
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:16,760
of a peric patient uh with the help of

854
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,400
the exos

855
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,800
skeleton so and then we now we want to

856
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,720
after the design is done we want to make

857
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,079
sure that it's safe to use for uh

858
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,359
patients and of course patient will not

859
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,400
come in one mass and one length of leg

860
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,359
and you know the parameters will change

861
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,640
right so in this case what we are doing

862
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,359
is we're treating the the variance the

863
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,760
variation and the parameters as our

864
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,839
initial set there is no difference

865
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,359
between dealing with an initial set of

866
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:49,880
States versus initial set of parameters

867
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,200
you can just treat parameters as state

868
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,160
variabl set their Dera equal to zero you

869
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,760
can apply the same methodology so in

870
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,560
this case the initial condition is

871
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,480
really not different you're sitting

872
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,240
right but what's different is some of

873
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,520
the parameters even the same patient

874
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,800
could after eating or wearing heavy

875
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,160
clothes would have a different mass and

876
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,359
so those numbers can change so it's good

877
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,960
to to see how much from a nominal

878
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:19,040
trajectory you've designed you will

879
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,599
deviate in when those parameters change

880
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,440
in this case you can actually attach

881
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,480
possibly a physically

882
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,960
meaningful um probability distribution

883
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,480
to the initial set because those

884
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,960
parameters may come from some

885
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:37,359
distribution anyway so the next slide is

886
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,599
showing you some simulation results um

887
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,160
the red bond is obtained from the

888
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,079
sensitivity method that I was explaining

889
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,119
earlier the second one that didn't have

890
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,319
formal guarantees and the blue one which

891
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:50,839
is very tight uh is obtained from

892
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:53,960
Scenario

893
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,839
optimization um and for the blue one the

894
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,599
number of samples that was required was

895
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:02,640
10 to 1,3 36 that came from uh the given

896
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,680
Epsilon and Delta

897
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,680
requirements now usually when you do

898
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,760
reachability right you know you you get

899
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,400
some

900
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,079
conservativeness and if you use that H

901
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,720
to see your next um level of

902
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,160
reachability analysis then you'll get

903
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,440
even more conservative right so the

904
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,240
erors keep growing what we are doing

905
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,079
here and the reason why these look so

906
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,880
tight is you asked me about the the

907
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:35,920
choice of T right so we split the time

908
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,839
interval of Interest into um segments

909
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,160
and each time we're doing these

910
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,480
simulations from zero up to that point

911
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,280
so like from 0 to1 0 to point2

912
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,720
0.23 that way we don't have this you

913
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,160
know inflation of the errors and that's

914
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,960
why how these bonds are looking so tight

915
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,640
otherwise you'd have some crazy growth

916
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,640
in

917
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,480
those all right uh so we we have some

918
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,280
toolboxes to implement some of these

919
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,160
methods I described tra is for the inter

920
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,119
reability analysis I described earlier

921
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,160
it's pretty flexible it's matlb based

922
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:11,880
you can there are some built-in

923
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,040
functions but it's open source and it

924
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,440
allows the user to add new methods uh a

925
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,680
postdoctor researcher at the time Pier

926
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,160
Jean mayor is back in France but he's um

927
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,880
he's still maintaining this toolbox we

928
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,480
also looked at parallelization one of

929
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,599
the nice things about sampling

930
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,119
is you know you're basically integrating

931
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,040
differential equations and you can

932
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,119
paralize this so we did some uh speed

933
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,400
test with a par we first did a

934
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,119
parallelized

935
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,440
implementation uh that was reported in

936
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:48,040
this in C to20 uh I think the tool is

937
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,280
called perk p i r k I forgot what it

938
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,599
stands for but it paralyzes the

939
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,960
computations and uh these simulations

940
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:00,160
are showing how with different um gpus

941
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,400
the different number of cores you can

942
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,480
scale even even

943
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:10,680
better okay so one last approach data

944
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,599
driven quite distinct from the scenario

945
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,400
optimization method this one is based on

946
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:18,040
the empirical risk minimization

947
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,319
literature although we don't need many

948
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,520
details from that literature so I'm just

949
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,040
basically compressing everything I need

950
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,400
into this theorem so in this case what

951
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:34,640
we doing is we select our reach set

952
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,240
estimates are had from a family of sets

953
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,000
Okay I'm going to narrow down that

954
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,040
family on the next slide but in the most

955
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,680
General case it's a it's a class of

956
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,560
sets and we choose one that has the

957
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,000
least volume that contains all the

958
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:51,520
samples we're not solving any

959
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,720
optimization problem like in the

960
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:59,119
um scenario optimization case now as

961
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,400
long as the class of fun class of sets

962
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,520
you're

963
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:08,800
using um has a VC

964
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:12,000
dimension of M or less than the

965
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,359
following um sample complexity bond

966
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,400
holds and you know I'm sure in this

967
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:18,440
Elite crowd many of you have been

968
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,760
exposed to VC Dimensions if not you will

969
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,079
be at some point I couldn't go through

970
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,520
this but it's basically a combinatorial

971
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,480
measure of the complexity of the set so

972
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,640
if that's a finite number M then this

973
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,480
sample complexity Bond will work okay

974
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:42,640
now in our case our choice of functions

975
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:46,040
are uh zero or suev sets of functions so

976
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,160
you can almost use the VC dimension for

977
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,400
uh sets or functions interchangeably as

978
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:55,480
long as you interpret the sets to be

979
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:58,599
subel sets so if I

980
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,440
select functions from a function space

981
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:06,200
of finite dimmension M okay then the

982
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,880
suble Lev set is going to have a VC

983
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,880
dimension of M okay and that's what we

984
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,960
going to do for example if you use

985
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,880
pols of fixed order naturally this is a

986
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:22,200
finite dimensional function space um and

987
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,680
you can use the zero level sets or any

988
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,400
suble sets of the polinomial as your

989
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,119
reset estimate and you can use this

990
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,559
sample complexity Bond now we are going

991
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,079
to use a polom not just any polinomial a

992
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,079
very special one called a christopal

993
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,800
function in fact if you look at the

994
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:42,520
definition of christopal function what

995
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,359
we are using is the inverse of that so

996
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,200
let's call it to be precise the inverse

997
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:49,079
christopal function of order K which

998
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,359
consists of this function that you see

999
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,800
here you form a vector of

1000
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,119
monomials up to degree K in the state

1001
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,119
variables and you form this quadratic

1002
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,200
expression where the Matrix in the

1003
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,680
middle is the So-Cal empirical moment

1004
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,880
Matrix which again uses these

1005
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,440
monomials evaluated at the sample points

1006
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,800
okay at the end of the day it's a

1007
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,880
quadratic

1008
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:18,000
expression and the vectors Z contains

1009
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,760
monomials and when you multiply them out

1010
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,280
you're going to get a polinomial of of

1011
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,240
degree 2K and that means this is a class

1012
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,839
of functions coming from a function

1013
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,119
space of dimension

1014
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:35,200
given by this expression n + 2 K choose

1015
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:37,640
n so we can apply the theorem okay so

1016
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,200
what we do is we collect our

1017
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,599
samples find the

1018
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,559
smallest level

1019
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:48,280
set of this polinomial that contains all

1020
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:52,160
the samples okay and use that as your

1021
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,400
reset estimate okay now the the bond I'm

1022
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,680
giving you is very generic right it it

1023
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,960
was true for anything of VC Dimension m

1024
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,359
but we narrowed it down to pols right in

1025
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,599
fact a very special type of polinomial

1026
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,520
so it's a very generic Bond not very

1027
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,559
specialized to this type of function at

1028
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,119
all but it works the question is why are

1029
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,599
we using this type of polinomial the

1030
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,520
answer comes from the machine learning

1031
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,599
literature christopal functions have

1032
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:24,839
been known for their support estimating

1033
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:27,040
quality support approximation for

1034
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:28,640
distributions okay and that's precisely

1035
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,680
what we are doing as I said at the

1036
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,400
beginning um the support of the

1037
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,160
distribution we are looking at we're

1038
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,160
drawing samples from is the exact reset

1039
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,000
so that's why we thought this would be

1040
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,240
relevant and one of the benefits of

1041
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,599
these functions is that the suble Lev

1042
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,319
sets morph into complex change pretty

1043
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,520
easily and we didn't in fact observe

1044
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:53,440
this in our numerical experiments again

1045
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,079
looking back at the Lawrence

1046
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,480
oscillator already with a 10 order

1047
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:03,240
polinomial you get pry nice um alter

1048
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,440
Bonds in addition uh if you take more

1049
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,680
and more samples you start actually

1050
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,880
spotting holes in the reachable set and

1051
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,920
this is easier to see in the duffing

1052
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,359
oscillator case it's a Time bearing

1053
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,680
duffing oscillator and it it's it's

1054
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:21,319
known for its chaotic Behavior so when

1055
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,319
you select more samples uh you start uh

1056
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:27,200
the suble set starts detecting some

1057
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:29,920
holes and if you do more more Hol all

1058
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,160
start appearing okay so it's a

1059
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,720
completely different approach by but the

1060
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,559
the main idea is again data driven and

1061
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,160
the probabilistic bond uh except that

1062
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,720
because of the very coarse nature of the

1063
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:48,160
sample complexity Bond we using we get

1064
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:50,800
very large numbers okay so before people

1065
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,440
start leaving let me conclude

1066
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,800
so reate is critical for many

1067
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,240
applications I did not go too far into

1068
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:02,079
the applications but um I narrowed it

1069
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,880
down to a very you know self-contained

1070
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,800
formulation and we show the promise of

1071
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,680
sampling approaches the question was how

1072
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,040
to generalize from the samples to

1073
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,280
unsampled trajectories and we use two

1074
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:17,200
lines of work we in one we use dynamical

1075
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,720
system properties particularly

1076
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,640
monotonous types of ideas and the other

1077
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,839
one we just use the prob probabilistic

1078
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,480
structure and the regularity of the sets

1079
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,359
that we are using as a estimators

1080
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,119
regularity in this case appeared in the

1081
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,440
form of a finite VC Dimension so to

1082
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,400
generalize you need something to to to

1083
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,079
use right so in one case it was the

1084
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,960
Dynamics themselves in the other case it

1085
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,359
was the regularity of the

1086
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,400
sets okay with that I'll leave you with

1087
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,440
some references where these results are

1088
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,440
discussed and I'll be happy to take any

1089
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,359
questions and it's 5:00 p.m. I'm

1090
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,359
impressed with my timing

1091
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,800
[Applause]
