27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,159
C Springs. Thank you Mickey.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,799
Well, it's my pleasure to be here. Um,

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,439
how many of you work in

30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,680
manufacturing? And I see a show of

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,040
hands. Anyone? How many of you work in

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,439
manufacturing cell and gene therapies?

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,119
Okay. All right. Great. That helps me,

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,280
you know, set the tone for what I'm

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
going to say today. Um, what I really

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
want to tell you about are the

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,560
activities at our center. So, I'm going

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,159
to give you an introduction to the

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,920
Center for Biomedical Innovation where

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
I'm executive director. I have a number

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,280
of roles here on campus. This is one of

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
them. Another role I have on campus is

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,720
at the Sloan School where I run a food

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
supply chain analytics and sensing

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,640
initiative. So, if you have interest in

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,200
food supply chains, please come see me

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
later. Um but today we're going to talk

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,840
about biologic medicines which are

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
important and challenging to manufacture

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,520
and we'll talk about some of our

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,479
research projects uh that we are doing

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,119
to overcome some of those obstacles to

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,800
development of manufacturing practices

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,319
and these you know have to do with

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,280
mechanistic modeling approaches, process

56
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,720
intensification, process analytical

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,800
technologies and rapid safety

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,080
tests. So the CBI is a center at MIT

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,520
that's been here since 2005. We are um

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,400
what I would consider a um a an a center

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,720
that accelerates uh the development and

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
adoption of advanced biommanufacturing

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,680
approaches and we do it in two ways. One

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,760
is driving the demonstration of novel

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
new technologies uh that are fit for

66
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,400
purpose for biommanufacturing and the

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,319
other are through um industry consorcia

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,080
activities where we're working together

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,000
with industry to develop consensus

70
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,319
opinions, develop consensus approaches

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to drive best industry practice and we

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,680
do that in a variety of ways that I'll

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,920
just mention quickly. So um we are

74
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
really focused on the entire healthcare

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,840
value change. we've settled in to some

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,040
extent on you know development uh of you

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,720
know clinical development and

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,400
manufacturing distribution and global

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,200
delivery and specifically on

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,360
biioharmaceuticals but really in

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,840
everything we do we're bringing together

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,599
teams and innovation initiatives that

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,920
might be a research program or a

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,560
pre-ompetitive consortium activity or

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,720
developing educational material for the

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,760
industry. We're bringing together people

87
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,560
to collaborate in what we're doing and

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,760
we do that in different ways. Um we

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,319
consider ourselves experts in regulatory

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,000
science and data analytics. So we're

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,720
always looking to apply data analytics

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,760
to the things that we are doing uh in

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,080
our in our our work. We work uh have

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,239
worked over the years quite a bit to

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
understand the regulatory um

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,159
implications of these technologies and

97
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,200
how they might be implemented, where

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,159
they might be implemented. And um we

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,239
also work on really understanding risk

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,920
um and risk risk assessment and risk

101
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,959
management and putting together tools

102
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,840
that the industry can use to basically

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,840
assess their own risk um related to for

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,920
instance uh adventitious agent

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
contamination and their

106
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,079
biommanufacturing processes and we

107
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,280
create tools that then they can use to

108
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,280
manage that risk. Um everything we're

109
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,360
doing really is with the end goal in

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,160
mind of providing better access to

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,800
biologic medicines which are comp

112
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,840
complex to make expensive to make and

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,160
not accessible to everyone around the

114
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,520
globe. So as I mentioned we have two

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,720
different or three different ways that

116
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
we approach this. It's through

117
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,400
collaboration, education and research.

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
And I'm just going to give you some

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
quick examples of collaboration and

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
education and then we'll move into the

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,280
research port portfolio for the rest of

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,120
my talk. So in terms of collaboration we

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,360
run two industry consortia. One is

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,520
called the biioan consortium. It focuses

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
on applications of machine learning and

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,479
AI in biio manufacturing, cell and gene

127
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,720
therapy manufacturing, product quality

128
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,880
control and vaccine manufacturing. And

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
we have 10 companies that you know meet

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,360
twice a year for uh workshops and we do

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,759
projects and other things within the

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
consortium. The other consortium as I

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,440
mentioned is on adventitious agent

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,199
contamination and that's where we really

135
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,199
look at you know what is the risk. It's

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
a it's a black swan type of event for

137
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
instance to have a viral contamination

138
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,800
in your manufacturing plant but we all

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,759
know it has happened and that puts

140
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,440
companies at significant risk. It puts

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
patients potentially at risk of not

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,080
receiving their products but it puts

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,720
companies at risk. It's very time

144
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,320
consuming to um do a root cause analysis

145
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
and understand what has happened and

146
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,240
then put in preventative and corrective

147
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,280
actions and then restart. You know,

148
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,280
you're talking months if not more of

149
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,320
downtime. So, we we have worked with the

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,479
industry to confidentially collect all

151
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,320
of their data around viral contamination

152
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,400
experiences, anonymize that, analyze it,

153
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,120
and share it back with the industry in

154
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,919
in a lessons learned exercise. as one of

155
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,800
the activities of the CAACB. But we also

156
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,800
look at new technologies for instance

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,479
next generation sequencing and others

158
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,319
for advantitious agent control um to you

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,560
know address some of the pillars of

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,280
safety that we use which is you know

161
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,639
basically testing your raw materials

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,479
being able to um you know always test

163
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,080
and um prevent any advents from getting

164
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
into your process. Well you need

165
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
technologies to do that. So what are

166
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
those? What are the best ones and how

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
can they be used? And then we look at

168
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,080
new challenges for adventious agent

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,919
control. So we had a pandemic not too

170
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,759
long ago. What does that mean when you

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,600
suddenly have a virus circulating and

172
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,960
you need to be making other vaccines or

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,120
you need to be making monoconal

174
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,520
antibodies? How do you think about that?

175
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,440
Um how do you uh determine what cell

176
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,639
lines are susceptible? How do you

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,560
decontaminate um your your workspaces?

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,840
So we think about that and then we've

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:08,160
also thought about in the face of ad uh

180
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:10,080
of um excuse me of uh of new you know

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
therapeutic modalities such as cell and

182
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,599
gene therapies. Are the types of

183
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,759
controls that we have put in place for

184
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,520
monoconal antibbody production fit for

185
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
purpose or do we need you know

186
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,039
additional ways to think about viral

187
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,280
safety uh or even bio burden in in the

188
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,680
context of these. So that's that's what

189
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,080
these two consorts should do. In terms

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,479
of education, we've we create a number

191
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,479
of different um online and residential

192
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,280
courses, short courses, professional

193
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,680
education courses all in the in the area

194
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
of biio manufacturing. So I'll just

195
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,080
focus on a couple of these. Um,

196
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,080
principles of biio manufacturing is an

197
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,479
online course. It takes you through six

198
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,360
weeks of the production of a monoconal

199
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,080
antibbody and insulin and it's you know

200
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,000
available now through our expro um

201
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,479
platform here at MIT but it ran for

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,960
years on at the edex platform for free

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,800
and you could get a certificate. We do a

204
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,560
vaccines short course with University

205
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,360
College London. It'll be June 3rd

206
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,319
through 5th this year at the MIT campus

207
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,960
and it rotates between MIT and and uh

208
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,319
London. Um so this year it's at MIT,

209
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,440
next year it'll be in in the UK and then

210
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,639
um we um have residential courses to

211
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,599
really teach uh the students about

212
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,919
biommanufacturing and we have developed

213
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,759
a cell therapy course most recently

214
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,599
we've been working on it'll launch this

215
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,880
fall um a vaccine development and

216
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,919
manufactured blended learning course. So

217
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,080
there will be online um learning you can

218
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,240
do through MIT and you can do hands-on

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,159
learning at Quincy College and that was

220
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,959
supported by Nimble and done in

221
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,720
collaboration with Merc and Sanopi. And

222
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
as we develop these courses, you know,

223
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
we really work closely with these

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,680
companies to, you know, review the

225
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,320
curriculum we've developed to really get

226
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,120
input and also we go into these

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
companies. We film real, you know, uh,

228
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,160
machinery and and equipment that is

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
being used. Um, we interview experts.

230
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,880
So, there's a lot of really great stuff

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,399
in these courses to check out. Um, we're

232
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,800
doing a short course this year. It'll be

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
the first time through professional

234
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,519
education at uh on cell therapy

235
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,360
manufacturing only. Um and that'll be uh

236
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,800
the first or the second week of

237
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,480
July. So just in terms of outcomes of

238
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,040
these courses, these courses have

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,160
reached literally you know thousands of

240
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,519
people 15 16,000 people between the biio

241
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,440
manufacturing course and the cell

242
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,279
therapy course. And it's mostly people

243
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,560
in healthcare and biotechnology um and

244
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,480
pharmaceutical industries but sometimes

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,480
you get others. And so you can see that

246
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,399
the the reach of these courses is quite

247
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,440
wide. And we um have also written some

248
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,880
uh some you know academic papers around

249
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,560
the curriculum development and

250
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,760
assessment that we have done in these in

251
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,040
these uh particular courses. All right.

252
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,640
So with that go on to research. So we do

253
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,480
a wide variety of research at the

254
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,800
center. So we have been focused on um

255
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,519
you know basically any way that we can

256
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,079
intensify or apply modeling or develop

257
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,959
analytical tools for all biologic

258
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,440
medicines starting with monoconal

259
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:23,839
antibodies. We have developed at MIT a a

260
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,079
test bed um for continuous manufacturing

261
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,680
where we have um been doing something we

262
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,000
call smart data analytics which is

263
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,200
trying to understand how to use all the

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,600
data both in the process um but also at

265
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,320
the plant level where we've collaborated

266
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,640
with industry to get um a whole plant's

267
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,160
worth of data around two monoconal

268
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,200
antibodies to develop basically models

269
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,600
um that have helped us with um looking

270
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,160
at you know root cause analysis,

271
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,480
predictive um predictive maintenance,

272
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,240
things of that nature. And then we've

273
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,200
also worked with um a company to look

274
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,800
outside of um the plant in the

275
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,399
manufacturing ecosystem. So once a

276
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,640
monoconal antibbody is uh being

277
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,000
manufactured you have postmarket data

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
and how do we look at that and

279
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,920
understand where there could be u

280
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,480
specific um issues that arise in terms

281
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,360
of drug safety signals that relate back

282
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,800
to the drug manufacturing or supply. Now

283
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,880
I'm not going to talk about any of that

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,480
today because I only have time to talk a

285
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,240
little bit about the the cell and gene

286
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
therapy manufacturing but I did want to

287
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,519
mention that that is a very active area

288
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,640
for our center. We also work on uh

289
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,880
continuous manufacturing of vaccines. We

290
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,880
work on exoome manufacturing. That's a

291
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,640
new area that we've just started working

292
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,800
on about a year ago. And um we work on

293
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,200
postmarket drug safety surveillance as I

294
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,200
briefly touched

295
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,519
upon. So what I'll talk about today um

296
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,760
are our efforts in gene therapy and cell

297
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
therapy manufacturing. And I just want

298
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,160
to give a shout out to some of our

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,360
affiliated faculty who work on different

300
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,560
aspects of this work. Um you'll hear uh

301
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,320
work today from myself, Professor

302
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,279
Richard Bratz who's a professor in

303
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
chemical engineering. Uh professor Jay

304
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,279
Han who's a professor of electrical

305
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,720
engineering and biological engineering.

306
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,240
Professor Scott Manales uh professor uh

307
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,959
in engineering and associate head of

308
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,160
biological engineering and Rajie Ram uh

309
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,480
potentially among

310
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,200
others. So uh gene therapy has

311
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,920
tremendous potential um against genetic

312
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,480
disorders and other severe uh illnesses.

313
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,519
As you probably know there are already

314
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,440
eight FDA approved therapies um if not

315
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,880
more depending upon you know how you

316
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,399
define a gene therapy. And um we have

317
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:52,399
specifically focused on recominant AAV

318
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,959
as a delivery vehicle for gene therapies

319
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,720
and we have worked on uh how to improve

320
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,240
the manufacturing of that viral

321
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,920
vector. So there are a lot of critical

322
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,560
challenges in AV manufacturing. Um there

323
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,120
is a uh demand that exceeds the

324
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,920
production capacity. um very high

325
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,880
manufacturing costs that contribute to

326
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,600
the price per dose of these medicines.

327
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,079
And as you know, we have both small and

328
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,000
large patient populations that we're

329
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,200
trying to serve. So you may be wanting

330
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
to make a an um a gene therapy for an

331
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,800
ultra rare disease that you know only

332
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
has tens of patients or you may be

333
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,639
looking like in the case of cickle cell

334
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,480
to be serving you know millions of

335
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,079
patients and so that has different

336
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,680
demands for the

337
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,279
manufacturing. So this is just uh

338
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,240
showing it pictorially in a different

339
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,320
way where the dose is shown in red um

340
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,399
the total production scale is shown in

341
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,240
blue and then the total number of

342
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,720
patients is shown in green. And so for

343
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,760
Libr's congenital amorosis you really

344
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,760
need a very small dose. Um you you know

345
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,639
basically uh have a small number of

346
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,519
patients. Um but in the case of you know

347
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,760
muscul musculardrophe you basically need

348
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,079
very large doses for a very small number

349
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,040
of patients and then for cickle cell you

350
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,920
need essentially a large scale of

351
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,760
manufacturing. So we need this

352
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
innovation to meet the demand of both

353
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,199
rare disease and large patient

354
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,680
populations and that's what we've been

355
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,360
working on. So, you know, some of the

356
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,360
other challenges just to lay them out in

357
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,839
this one slide. It's it's a rule at MIT

358
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,519
that everybody uses 10point uh font and

359
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,600
tries to put as much on their slide as

360
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,560
they possibly can. So, apologies for

361
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,040
that on these small screens. But um

362
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,760
there are two platforms uh for AAV

363
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,880
manufacturing. One of them is triple

364
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,040
transffection of HK293 cells and that's

365
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,199
shown over here on the right where

366
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,639
you're basically delivering your trans

367
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,920
gene um the replication and capsid

368
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,760
producing uh genes rep and cap and then

369
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,560
a helper gene which is needed. So three

370
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,760
plasmids basically going into HK293

371
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,480
cells to produce your viral vector that

372
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,199
then has to get packaged with the gene

373
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,680
of interest. The other way that we can

374
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,120
make these vectors is through using a

375
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,760
bula virus infection of insect cells

376
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,600
where it's typically SF9 cells. And here

377
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,160
there are a number of different um

378
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,240
constructs that are being used. But

379
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,399
typically in all of these systems,

380
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,959
they're very highly inefficient. You're

381
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,600
making anywhere between, you know, um

382
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,240
five and 30% of the material after

383
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,639
you've purified it. It requires multiple

384
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,880
downstream purification steps. and every

385
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,880
one that you go through cuts into your

386
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,279
yield even more. So the you know the

387
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,120
final yields are not good. You have a

388
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:46,079
number of both process and um product

389
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,720
related impurities. So not only do you

390
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
uh end up making these um capsids that

391
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
have the gene of interest that you're

392
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,079
you want, but you make some that are

393
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,839
partially filled and you make some that

394
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,519
are empty and you know to a

395
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,079
chromatography column that all looks

396
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,000
pretty much the same. So it's hard to be

397
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,959
able to purify these away from one

398
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
another which makes it very um very

399
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,600
challenging in terms of the

400
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,160
manufacturing. So what are we doing to

401
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,839
address some of these issues? So the

402
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,680
first thing that we're trying to do is

403
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,320
better understand the biology because

404
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,399
the better we can understand how these

405
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,639
um capsids are actually made and

406
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,920
packaged, we can find levers that can

407
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,839
help us to uh make choices in the

408
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,880
manufacturing that will improve the

409
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,880
yields. Then we're developing new tools

410
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,639
that can help us in line be able to

411
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,720
detect whether we have you know full or

412
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,440
empty capsids and can we distinguish

413
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,920
between those um at line rather than

414
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,680
needing to wait and do it offline which

415
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,399
right now it's done through a very

416
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,399
laborious and timeconuming set of you

417
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,079
know methods um although there are new

418
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,480
technologies coming along and I'll talk

419
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,959
about some of those as we as we go along

420
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,360
and then we can work on intensifying our

421
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,519
manufacturing process. So we could make

422
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
it continuous for instance. So instead

423
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,679
of just you know putting everything in

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,160
the bioreactor adding essentially the

425
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,480
nutrients and let it go until it it it

426
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,120
eats all of those we can you know

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,280
basically take cells and media off and

428
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,280
replenish the bioreactor with new new

429
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,280
material and keep that culture going and

430
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,400
producing. So these are all things and

431
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,559
approaches that we are taking.

432
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
So first on the mechanistic modeling,

433
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,440
the reason that we use mechanistic

434
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,280
models, as I said, is to really combine

435
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
not only just the cell biology, but the

436
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,280
viology and the process dynamics of

437
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,200
what's happening. And we're really

438
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,919
trying to go up this triangle I'm

439
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,480
showing here to move away from datadive

440
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,080
trial and error experimentation to where

441
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,559
we really understand the first

442
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,360
principles and understand how this is

443
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,600
working within the cell. And so um if

444
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,840
you create a mechanistic model then you

445
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,440
you can you know identify what's

446
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,520
happening and the bottlenecks and

447
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,960
overcome those. So we've done this quite

448
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,600
a bit. We've published a number of

449
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,039
papers um in this area. I'll review a

450
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,960
little bit of that work with you today

451
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,840
but I encourage you to go look at these

452
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,160
papers if this is of interest to you. So

453
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,120
the first model that we developed was

454
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,480
for the um PEI mediated triple

455
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,000
transfaction in HK293. And so what this

456
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,400
process um involves is actually creating

457
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,520
a number of equations that describe

458
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,120
essentially what's happening in the

459
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
cell. So what we do is we go to the

460
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,559
literature and we find as much

461
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,360
information as we can and then we go to

462
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,160
the lab and we add more data to support

463
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,840
the development of this model. And so we

464
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,880
developed um in in 2021 the first model

465
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,200
um for this process and essentially it

466
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,080
describes everything from you know how

467
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,039
we get the the the different plasmids

468
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,200
into the nucleus um to the processes

469
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,400
that then happen thereafter to make the

470
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,520
capsids and and secrete them. And so it

471
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,760
talks about the rep protein and viral

472
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,600
protein synthesis and dynamics, the

473
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,480
regulatory functions, the capsid

474
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,600
assembly, viral DNA replication, DNA

475
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,520
packaging and capsid secretion. Um we

476
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,240
assume the empty and full capsids have

477
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,559
the same secretion um kinetics for the

478
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,160
purpose of this

479
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,320
model. And then you can see that you

480
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,000
know from our data inhouse we have very

481
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,000
good um uh so essentially you're seeing

482
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,799
the experimental data points are shown

483
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,559
as the um the triangles or the diamonds

484
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,760
and then the lines are the model and so

485
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,799
we have very good um reproduction of the

486
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,640
dynamics of viral

487
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:39,520
production and what we learned from this

488
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,400
particular work was that um in fact most

489
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,480
of the empty capsids uh I'm sorry most

490
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,160
of the um capsids that were making and

491
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,160
harvest are being made um later or

492
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,919
earlier than the DNA is being

493
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,640
replicated. So we've got this

494
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,039
discoordination or this mismatch between

495
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,960
you know expressing the capsid proteins

496
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,960
assembling a capsid and and when there's

497
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,840
actually DNA available to put in into

498
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,200
it. So aha that gave us some some ideas

499
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,120
about how we might address this and um

500
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,200
this was you know around extending the

501
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,000
capsid production timeline to improve

502
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
that full empty

503
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,559
ratio. We did the same thing for the

504
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,600
bula virus insect cell system. We built

505
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,640
uh this was work from friend uh Chesco

506
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Destra and Richard BRZ. We built a model

507
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,320
that uh again allowed us to understand

508
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,039
that in this case um these you know

509
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,200
replication uh the transcription of

510
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,559
these replication proteins um such as

511
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,280
rep uh 78 that rate controls the full

512
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,520
AAV production and we also found that

513
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,039
among the different um systems that are

514
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,799
used for bacular virus infection um two

515
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,520
back seems to be better than threeback

516
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,039
because there's stronger rep expression

517
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,600
um because there's a stronger promoter

518
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,200
in particular system. So you know you

519
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,679
can learn things like this through the

520
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,000
model and then you can um you know set

521
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,559
some hypotheses around how you might

522
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,480
address that. So we said okay well what

523
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,559
if we you know feed plasmid uh in in

524
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,799
multiple stages. So we do not just a

525
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,200
single stage transfection but we compare

526
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,760
that to basically splitting those

527
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,679
plasmids in half and dosing twice or

528
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,480
even dosing three times. And so that's

529
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,679
what we the experiment we did. And of

530
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,640
course we saw um a a reasonably modest

531
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,000
but still very significant increase in

532
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,120
the full cap caps capsid harvest when

533
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,039
you had um two rather than uh one or

534
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,799
three. And just in the interest of time

535
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm going to keep moving because I can

536
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,919
see that I also was ambitious in my

537
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,080
slides. Um so we also developed a

538
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,440
continuous highdensity multid-dosese uh

539
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,760
AAV production process um based on this

540
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,000
and um so we looked at different um uh

541
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,880
you know basically different approaches

542
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,679
to doing this where we would um

543
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,159
retransect if you will at different uh

544
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,760
times into the continuous process. So

545
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,840
now we're, you know, we could

546
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,720
continuously growing these and then um

547
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,760
every so many days we're

548
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,280
retransfecting. And what we were able to

549
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,840
see was that we could grow these cells

550
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,320
at high density. We could also model

551
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,440
this. We could um increase the vector

552
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,159
genome tighter. Um and um we also

553
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,600
noticed that um interestingly there was

554
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,840
an order of magnitude um increase in the

555
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,440
um reccominant AEV inside the cells

556
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,080
compared to the supernate. So that's

557
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,280
probably another area um where you could

558
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,360
work on improving yields. Um but as you

559
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,919
can see we you know when we look at day

560
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,080
zero versus um days seven and nine

561
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,640
combined we can see almost a order of

562
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,960
magnitude improvement in the production

563
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
of full

564
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,440
capsits. So really briefly one way that

565
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,720
we are approaching um the purification

566
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,039
challenge um is to develop selective

567
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,679
viral vector crystallization uh

568
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,360
capability. So again, we need the full,

569
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,080
not the empties, not the partially

570
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,360
filleds. And so um what Richard Bratz

571
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,159
lab and um has done is to you know map

572
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,960
out the space um much like you would

573
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,760
like a phase diagram of where you can

574
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,080
actually preferentially crystallize

575
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,240
different um stereotypes of AAV. And so

576
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,640
you can see here at different phes he

577
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,080
looked at this and these you know would

578
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,640
be where you would be able to

579
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,480
crystallize the foss over the empties.

580
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,120
And so that gives you essentially and he

581
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,679
did this for a number of cereotypes and

582
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,320
found that um you know you could find

583
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,640
these sweet spots for crystallization.

584
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,559
And so we've done that at a very small

585
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,320
like hanging drop scale and now we're

586
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,240
doing it at a midscale um with uh with

587
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,640
the different stereotypes of AEV. So

588
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,120
that's very exciting and could be a

589
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,159
really important way of being able to

590
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,919
improve um the the purification of

591
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,280
these.

592
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,039
The other thing I want to share with you

593
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
about the AAV work that we've done is

594
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,840
that we've tried to work also at a very

595
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,799
small scale to understand how we might

596
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,880
um improve the economics around um you

597
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,840
know just making a few doses of these

598
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,240
for individual or patients where there

599
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,960
are not you know there's only a few that

600
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,720
have a particular indication and so um

601
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,520
at

602
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,559
MIT professor uh Rajiv Ram and also

603
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,039
professor Tony Sinski um invented these

604
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,799
really cool microb

605
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,000
bioreactors. They were um spun out into

606
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,120
a company and then acquired by

607
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,120
Millipore. They're currently called the

608
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,159
Mobius Breeze, but they are they're

609
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,279
basically two millimeter

610
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:47,039
microbitors that um you can basically um

611
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,360
run these in a variety of different

612
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,960
modes um anywhere from you know batch

613
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,200
fed batch to to uh perusion or

614
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,919
continuous and we've been able to um you

615
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,840
know basically grow HK29 cells which are

616
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,919
kind of sensitive um all the way up to

617
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,520
like 100 million cells per mill in these

618
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,840
little micro bioreactors and uh and then

619
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,760
start doing transfection reactions in

620
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,200
these and we've learned a couple of

621
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,159
things so far and one of the great

622
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,039
things about these um systems is that

623
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,600
you know you have um basically real time

624
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,640
uh measurements of pH ox dissolved

625
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,840
oxygen um and many other factors that

626
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,960
you can um monitor from your laptop at

627
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,279
home and so um we get a lot of data

628
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,200
coming out off of these about you know

629
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,520
essentially how the process is

630
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,520
proceeding

631
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,799
Um so we've done the triple

632
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,600
transffection as I mentioned uh in here

633
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,840
and what we identified is that you know

634
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,400
PEI is essentially like a poison you

635
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,799
know it's it's required you need it to

636
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,799
essentially create a charge around the

637
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,840
you know um DNA that you're trying to

638
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,840
put into the cells but it also you know

639
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,120
has a negative effect on the cells and

640
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,600
so you know we did some we looked at you

641
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,880
know after transfection letting the

642
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,480
cells uh grow for nine for for 9 hours

643
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,679
versus 24 hours. And what you find is

644
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,039
that um you can actually get a lot of

645
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,400
improvement if you only um if you only

646
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,640
let these grow for 9 hours um instead of

647
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,279
24 after you start after the

648
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,840
transfection. And so um we found that

649
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,279
the percentage of filled capsids was

650
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,159
significantly higher um apologies for

651
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,799
that. and um and the vector genome

652
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,640
tighter uh per cell was also twofold

653
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,520
higher for at the at the 9h hour

654
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,480
compared to the

655
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,320
24-hour. Okay, so um this is really like

656
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,640
the the drink from the fire hose version

657
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,960
of this talk. So I apologize for going

658
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,320
so quickly through so many things. The

659
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,919
next thing I want to talk with you about

660
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,799
are some of the analytical technologies

661
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,640
we've been working on to be able to

662
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:03,840
better um separate and or analyze um

663
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,679
full versus empty capsids um and other

664
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,360
features of um you know AEV. And so in

665
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,799
this particular work that was done by

666
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,240
professor Jong Yun Han and Ming uh Su

667
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,640
basically they've been able to use

668
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,080
electropharetic um chargebased

669
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,720
separation in these micrfluidic devices

670
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,799
to be able to turn on the electric field

671
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,919
and go from you know a single stream of

672
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,960
a mixture into a very clear mixture of

673
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,120
empty versus full AAVs.

674
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,440
In addition, we've been working with

675
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,559
Professor Scott Manales who um has

676
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,279
developed these single nanoch resonator

677
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:44,559
devices. So you can think about this as

678
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:47,200
being a um little diving board that

679
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,240
resonates with a certain frequency and

680
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,320
that frequency is um related to the mass

681
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,440
that's you know going through there. And

682
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,520
so you can use this um basically we he

683
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,200
has used it over the years to do a

684
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,840
number of of really interesting

685
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,559
mass-based measurements related to

686
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,960
cells. But in this case he made a nanoch

687
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,679
resonator. So even smaller small enough

688
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,760
that we um we asked the question can we

689
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,880
use this device to detect the difference

690
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,600
between a full and an empty AAV um

691
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,039
particle. And so as you can see we got

692
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,399
this very um you know messy looking uh

693
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,440
signal coming coming off of this. But um

694
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,320
Yorgos uh Katsikus who basically did

695
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,720
this work um was able to deconvolute

696
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,080
this and we worked together with

697
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,200
Biomaren who did essentially all the um

698
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,039
standard analytics including um the

699
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
dynamic light scattering which is shown

700
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,240
in purple here. And then basically um

701
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,640
what you're seeing here is both the um

702
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,200
the predicted and the you know the

703
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
actual data coming out of this uh model.

704
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,799
And you can see we do pretty well

705
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,080
actually at being able to um both

706
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,000
simulate uh what's happening in the

707
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,000
experimental data and match what's

708
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,159
happening uh through other other

709
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
measurements. So this actually in fact

710
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,360
is a method that can distinguish empty

711
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,679
and full capsids uh in real time and and

712
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,799
um it's b basically able to distinguish

713
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,360
the difference between literally an add

714
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,520
of

715
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,679
material. And then more recently we've

716
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,720
been wondering whether we could use um

717
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,520
the these this same kind of approach um

718
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,279
for the cells to ask questions about you

719
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,159
know the cells and whether we could

720
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:35,520
really see whether we could um measure

721
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,240
the tighter that was uh developing for

722
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,919
the full capsids because it's it's

723
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,600
currently as I mentioned you know it

724
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,080
takes a long time to um do essentially

725
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,960
you know you measure the total capsids

726
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,520
um through uh a combination of both

727
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,159
Eliza and digital droplet PCR. And so

728
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,919
these are labor intensive and and um you

729
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,840
know we want to have real-time tools at

730
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:03,360
our disposal that can tell us how much

731
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:07,200
material we have. And so what um what um

732
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,240
uh Francesco um Destro and Wayda Woo or

733
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,360
Richard Woo did is they basically um

734
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,880
took this um this device and then they

735
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,760
put a microscope on it and they were

736
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,080
able to actually um you know ask

737
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,399
questions about these different

738
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,960
biohysical characteristics, the buoyant

739
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,120
dry mass, the volume and the density of

740
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,880
these cells and then put them into a

741
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,000
machine learning model and ask whether

742
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,760
there they they could um develop a model

743
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,360
that would be predictive for the full

744
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,520
capsids. And so they did a number of

745
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,200
different um experiments with different

746
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:47,360
packet plasmid ratios and um and

747
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,960
um and then they uh added this you know

748
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,640
they they did this experiment where they

749
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
had time matched samples and you know

750
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,559
basically I'm not sure what's going on

751
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,080
with my slide here but um basically they

752
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,000
were able to do a number of different

753
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,799
single cell measurements put them into a

754
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,120
matrix do the machine learning model and

755
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,960
basically look at the capsid and how

756
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,240
well it predicts the capsidin genome

757
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,720
tighter and so they don't need to do

758
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,279
that that part then on a regular basis

759
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,600
except for the model development itself

760
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,320
and so here essentially is just showing

761
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:24,000
you know some of the um data both zero

762
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,399
and 72 hours post transfaction then as I

763
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,640
mentioned it goes into um all the raw

764
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,880
data goes into this matrix they do

765
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,520
feature

766
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,080
extraction and then um that that is you

767
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,640
know goes into um a matrix that can feed

768
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,720
the machine learning models. And so, you

769
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,120
know, from that um they they've been

770
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,600
able to do this

771
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,440
unsupervised learning process to um use

772
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,000
a a principal component analysis of

773
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,000
feature matrix spontaneously organizing

774
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,720
the samples um with respect to

775
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,279
transfaction process. And then this is

776
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,799
sort of the the end result here is

777
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,640
comparing both the data points in um in

778
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,600
black for Eliza on this side and DDPCR

779
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,919
with the SMR plus machine learning shown

780
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,480
in red or purple and we do pretty good

781
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,919
actually for you know the the first few

782
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,360
experiments out of the gate. This is all

783
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,240
unpublished um data as for the moment.

784
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,960
All right. So um they did some cross

785
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,679
validation and uh and also they did work

786
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,240
to um develop an interpretable

787
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,399
interpretable model for this um so that

788
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,440
we understand essentially you know what

789
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,840
what what relates to what here. Okay.

790
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,440
And um and so one of the things one of

791
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,840
the takeaways so far that we've been

792
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,679
learning is that high high recominant

793
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,919
AAV production correlates to um uh low

794
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,279
mass and volume of the cells. So smaller

795
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,600
cells seem to be making more AAV. Um so

796
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,919
that's interesting and they've validated

797
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,799
that with single cell GFP uh

798
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,159
measurements as well. So one of the

799
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,320
things that we've been doing in

800
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,000
Singapore um is we have an

801
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,600
interdisciplinary research group called

802
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,760
CAMP or critical analytics for

803
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,519
manufacturing personalized medicine. And

804
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,600
so there's a group myself and a group of

805
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,480
about five or six other faculty working

806
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,320
there in Singapore. Um we are making

807
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,799
analytical technologies that support

808
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,399
basically you know stem cell cartis cell

809
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,799
IPSC cell uh isolation characterization

810
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,200
cell processing and engineering quality

811
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,880
assessment um including potency and

812
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,279
safety and then we're working with the

813
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,240
clinical environment there to test our

814
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,799
technologies uh in these areas and while

815
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,360
I won't have time today to tell you you

816
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,399
know more about these um I just want to

817
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,080
you know end by saying that um you know

818
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,760
we've developed a number of different

819
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,600
sterility tests, a number of different

820
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,840
tests that uh a number of different

821
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,200
technologies that can sort cells into um

822
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,840
populations and we've also done a lot of

823
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,159
work to develop um small those smallcale

824
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,720
bioreactors for CARTT production as

825
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,120
well. So, with that, I'm gonna have to

826
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,880
stop apparently and um I'll be happy to

827
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,119
take any questions and I'll try to stick

828
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,079
around through like 10 minutes or so of

829
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,599
the break in case people um would like

830
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,720
to ask me anything. And you're welcome

831
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,320
to email me um and I'll be happy to to

832
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,679
uh answer any questions you have if we

833
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,679
don't have time here. Okay. Thank you.
