00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
A lot of people have a hard time seeing

2
00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:05,120
[music] that climate change is affecting

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,279
our day-to-day lives. They see it as

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
something distant. But the reality that

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,200
climate change is already here. I want

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,360
everybody to close their eyes. Imagine

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
that we're all on the same team and the

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,520
game is on the line. We're not just

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,279
playing for ourselves. We're playing for

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,680
the next generation. Open your eyes.

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,039
Who is willing to do what it takes to

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,039
win? This is the city of champions,

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,039
right?

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
So I think we should all take [music]

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,960
responsibility and carry a championship

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,160
mindset in our environment starts with

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,520
us and we can start a global movement in

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,680
the future. Let's stand together united

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,480
in our purpose with unwavering [music]

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,435
commitment. The time to act is now.

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,455
Thank you.
