data Design Lab and the MIT Urban risk

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,399
lab welcome to John who's presenting

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,840
Civic

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,559
Atlas thanks Trisha um my name is John

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,120
um as Trisha mentioned I'm an urban

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,879
planner and the founder and CEO of Civic

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,640
Atlas we're an AI powered platform for

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,039
tracking Urban Development Across the

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,039
United

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
States prior to my time at MIT I spent

24
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,680
10 years working as an urban planner in

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
Dallas Texas and along the way I found

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,559
out that it's really hard to keep track

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,040
of Urban Development um you see here all

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119
this lovely paperwork on the right um

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,040
these are zoning cases in Dallas a

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,159
really important source of information

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,799
about new development and I was having

32
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,119
to spend tens of hours each week reading

33
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,720
these manually copy and pasting the

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,360
results into spreadsheets and mapping it

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,880
in GIS um today if you actually want to

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,400
understand the building supply pipeline

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,680
of a city you have to do exactly this

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,799
manual process gather data from building

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,200
per permits planning commissions public

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,600
meeting agendas and then map it all in

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,880
GIS very few organizations can afford to

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,079
spend all this time doing this um and

43
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,240
the consequence is that America doesn't

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,280
really know what it's

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,159
building over the past 20 years Civic

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,119
technologists have started working on

47
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,159
solutions to this unfortunately almost

48
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,560
all the tools out there only work for

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,640
one city at a time and they still rely

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,560
on someone manually entering data um or

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,079
for local governments to keep really

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,399
clean well-maintained apis which is Out

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,679
Of Reach for a lot of smaller or rural

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,080
municipalities um the exciting thing is

55
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,400
that new technologies specifically large

56
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,000
language models mean that an automated

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,599
more standardized approach is now

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,760
possible at Civic Atlas we've been

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,319
building an allpurpose workflow where we

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,239
can go into any City regardless of how

61
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,560
they store data around peris res zoning

62
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,879
cases and integrate it to give you a

63
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,920
clear picture of the building supply

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,440
pipeline we start with web scrapers that

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,000
pull raw public records straight from G

66
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,640
websites we then use llms and

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,800
traditional ETL methods to take data

68
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,680
from those 100 page PDFs and put into

69
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,280
Json um a white weight flexible format

70
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,360
um that most web apps can work with we

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,280
then use large language models to enrich

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,400
location information where needed and

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
then we can geocode it um through apis

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,120
like Google Maps um a lot of the time

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,360
zoning cases don't even have addresses

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,879
they have weird legally as phrases

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,319
um you know at the intersection of

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,159
Lovers Lane and and mocking bir Drive um

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,799
but LMS are great at taking that and

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,040
turning into something that apis can

81
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,840
understand we then pull this data from

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,640
every different city in the US put it

83
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,840
into one clean web app and we can make

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,680
it just as clean intuitive and user

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,280
friendly um as apps like Zillow Airbnb

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,080
or Google

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,640
Maps this past November we launched our

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
first beta in Dallas uh we built a

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,799
real-time map of every billing permit

90
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,360
and planning case in the city uh you can

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
try this out for free at Civic gas.net

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,519
um without spending a dollar on

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
Advertising we got over 80 Enterprise

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,799
signups um and really exciting positive

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,200
local news coverage as you'd expect most

96
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,200
of our users are based in real estate um

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,879
but we also have major retailers

98
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,239
Architects um community members

99
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,920
neighborhood associations academics

100
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,760
there's a lot of different people that

101
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,519
want information about building that

102
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,280
just don't have access to it um with

103
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,439
existing tools

104
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,519
today um highlighting a couple of our

105
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,120
major success stories um one of our

106
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,760
users is Crow Holdings they're a major

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,840
real estate investor and developer in

108
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,480
Dallas and they use us to track the

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,280
multif family housing Supply um they say

110
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,199
that having a good understanding of

111
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,440
upcoming development is hugely

112
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,520
significant for determining the

113
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,479
profitability of their Investments

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,919
existing softwares don't do a good job

115
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,560
of this and so we help them invest much

116
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,039
more effectively than their competitors

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,000
Vision Plus is an Architecture Firm that

118
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,039
advises developers on how to build new

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,280
projects in

120
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,479
Dallas as they go through a complex

121
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,680
zoning in a titon process it's important

122
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,039
for them to find examples of other

123
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,440
developments they got City approval

124
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,000
right now this is really difficult you

125
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,320
got to spend a lot of time going through

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
those PDFs but we make it really fast

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,880
for them to find comparable projects

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,800
this helps them reduce project delays

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,000
get new housing built faster um and

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
build trust with

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
communities um lastly kind of a fun

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,000
exciting use um is the Dallas Free Press

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,160
they're a local newspaper um and as you

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
may be aware a lot of local media has

135
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
lost the funding to have reporters

136
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,320
follow City Hall closely um we sort of

137
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,080
act as a force multiplier for their

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,520
reporting team helping them track real

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,560
estate cases that otherwise they

140
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,000
wouldn't afford to cover um and this

141
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,800
gets trusted information out to the

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,360
public and kind of builds a sense of

143
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,319
community knowledge and Trust about

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,880
uping

145
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,960
development our next step is to take all

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,039
this raw data and start turning it into

147
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,880
statistics and highle analytics um we'll

148
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,880
be able to have people compare any

149
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,560
custom geography across the country

150
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,240
things like zip codes census tracks and

151
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,600
see exactly what's getting built and how

152
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,800
it varies across

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,800
jurisdictions we can also layer in

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,680
demographic psychographic and Census

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,319
Data um and start doing Predictive

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,000
Analytics on where we can expect

157
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,120
development to happen um right now we're

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,919
looking for a large Enterprise pilot

159
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,639
partner to help us figure out what these

160
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
data points are most valuable and how

161
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,080
how can we combine it with your own

162
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,599
proprietary data to give you really

163
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,840
powerful tailored

164
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,080
insights um we're open to Partners in

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,120
any industry um a couple obvious

166
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,479
candidates to us would be retail where

167
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,800
we could help out with site selection

168
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,360
and predictive inventory analytics

169
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,599
commercial real estate for that market

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,240
intelligence use case mentioned earlier

171
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,680
um and then governments um we can use

172
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,759
this data to help Drive policy analysis

173
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,560
um and create tools for public data

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,560
transparency um my name is John um and

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
have to open things up for Q&A

176
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,840
excellent thank you so much John real

177
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,880
exciting stuff that you're you're doing

178
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,639
there with Civic Atlas few questions for

179
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,479
you um so you spoke about a little bit

180
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,479
but could you just uh expand are you

181
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:49,199
limited to any specific geography and

182
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,919
and why or why not yeah so uh we are not

183
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,520
limited to any specific geography um our

184
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,919
workflow can work um regardless of

185
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,199
country regardless of State we're

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,400
getting started in Texas um just as an

187
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,319
active real estate market it's a great

188
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,280
time Market but we can deploy this

189
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,800
technology anywhere fantastic and can

190
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,680
you use AI to summarize specific zoning

191
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,440
cases how does that work yeah so

192
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,319
thankfully a lot of these newer models

193
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,039
have context Windows long enough that

194
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,319
they can actually analyze these entire

195
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,000
100 page complex PDFs um so it's on a

196
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,840
road map to start generating kind of

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,840
clear concise summaries um of these huge

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,360
complex legal

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,160
documents fantastic and the next

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,000
question question we have for you is can

201
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,120
you use this approach for other public

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,599
records so um proposed City legislation

203
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,319
for example yeah yeah we we are not

204
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,520
limited to building permits and Zoning

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,520

206
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,639
looking at city council meeting agendas

207
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,720
and other public minutes um whatever

208
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,319
would be useful to to Partners um we can

209
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,720
integrate into the system fantastic well

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,720
