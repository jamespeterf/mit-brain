1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
Thanks for the introduction, Elena. So,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,799
yeah, I'm excited to be here for the

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,800
first uh computing and sustainability

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,040
seminar in the LID seminar series for

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,080
this academic year. And I'm excited to

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,480
be here to talk to you all about

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
foundation models, a uh really promising

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,359
new tool set to help us understand the

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,640
natural world. But I'll also be talking

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,400
about some of the challenges that we

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
still have to overcome before we really

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,439
can start to automate biodiversity

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,760
monitoring at scale with these new

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,439
approaches. And there's a really strong

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,399
sense of urgency around figuring this

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,280
out because as you probably know

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,920
worldwide plant uh biodiversity is under

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,680
threat from rapid anthropogenic changes.

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,040
This includes things such as land use

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,719
change like the 30 years of

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,640
deforestation you can see across the

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,559
Amazon on the left. But that also

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
includes rapid climate warming which you

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,239
can also likely see here on the right

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
from the retreat of the Columbia glacian

26
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,039
Alaska over the similar 30-year period.

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,719
These widespread changes have led to

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
radical losses in biodiversity

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,960
worldwide, including estimates that half

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,160
of the world's plant biomass has been

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
lost since the beginning of

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,479
industrialization and that animal

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,400
populations have shrunk by almost two

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,159
3/4 in the past 50 years alone.

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
These severe threats led to the adoption

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,560
of the conic Montreal biodiversity

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,000
global biodiversity framework in 2021

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,400
2022, excuse me, at COP 15. And the

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,080
these goals include target one of trying

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,040
to reduce loss of areas of high

41
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,040
biodiversity to near zero by 2030.

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,280
Target two of restoring 30% of the

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
world's degraded ecosystems to enhance

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,759
their ecosystem services, ecological

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,759
integrity, and connectivity. And target

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
three to conserve 30% of the world's

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
land, water, and sea to ensure that

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
important areas for biodiversity are

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,680
effectively conserved and managed.

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
However, to actually achieve these

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,119
goals, we need to actually know and

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
accurately assess where the world's

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,960
remaining biodiversity is located. And

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,200
additionally, how it is changing, which

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
is a challenging task.

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
Indeed, anthropogenic biodiversity

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
change is so widespread and happening at

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,320
such astonishing rates that our

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,719
traditional methods for monitoring

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,560
biodiversity on the ground such as surf

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,239
such as vegetation surveys, radio

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,879
tracking, and census counts to name a

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,720
few, they simply cannot keep up. And in

64
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,640
fact, there are so few experts for

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
collecting and identifying these species

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
and this data and so many regions at

67
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
risk around the world that we're quickly

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,599
reaching the point where we are there

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,360
are entire new species of insects,

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,120
fungi, microbes, and plants that we're

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,959
losing before they've even ever been

72
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,080
identified.

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,760
Therefore, for us to truly

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,840
comprehensively track the world's

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,120
biodiversity anthroposine, what we

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,440
really need is new automated

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,200
biodiversity monitoring methods, ideally

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,959
ones that can also leverage novel data

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,480
sources.

80
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
However, traditional approaches to

81
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
automating biodiversity are often data

82
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,480
constrained across many different

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
dimensions. So, for example, if we're

84
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,440
trying to enable comprehensive

85
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,360
wall-to-wall monitoring of biodiversity

86
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,360
at fine tempmporal scales and spatial

87
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,319
scales, we have products such as the

88
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
Neon network. Neon possesses a rich suit

89
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,599
of thousands of automated and

90
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,040
semi-automated insitu measurements that

91
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,720
are taken daily to yearly.

92
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,280
um but they have fewer than 100 sites

93
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
total across the entire continental US

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
which makes it difficult for us to make

95
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,840
inferences from this data at fine

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,760
spatial scales between these sites.

97
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
Similarly, species distribution modeling

98
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,000
approaches which use which are used to

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,000
try and predict species distributions

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,879
that find spatial and temporal

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,640
resolution nevertheless end up not being

102
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,560
at the spatial resolution we need to

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,480
understand how species are changing in

104
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,159
response to land use change because

105
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
these models are built often times with

106
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,760
low resolution climate variables like

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
you can see here in the top center.

108
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
These climate variables fail to capture

109
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
fine scale landscape patterns like the

110
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
vegetation transitions you can see for

111
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,959
the exact same geographic area in the

112
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,200
bottom center of the slide. Similarly,

113
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,840
we do have high resolution in space and

114
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,159
time methods for detecting deforestation

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,640
like forest watch. But these approaches

116
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
only have the spectral resolution for us

117
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
to capture major changes in forest

118
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
structure. Essentially deforestation or

119
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,680
no deforestation which gives us no

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
signal on what species may have been

121
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
deforested in these areas.

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
and in general miss more subtle changes

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
in vegetation community that are

124
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,040
happening as climate change starts to

125
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,280
become even more important on natural

126
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,199
communities.

127
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
Additional modeling challenges include

128
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,959
the scale at which these changes are

129
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,160
occurring and the drivers of which these

130
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,160
occurring are very mismatched.

131
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,919
For example, climate warming is

132
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
consistent in global scale but happens

133
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,160
at a very slow pace for many for many

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
species. For example, you can see here,

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
this is the the creeping up of a tree

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
line in Sweden over 100-year time

137
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,800
period. So, as you can see, obviously

138
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,560
the tree line is moving up as the

139
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,840
climate warms, but it's moving only

140
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,160
about 100 meters every 100 years. On the

141
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,759
other hand, land use change is very

142
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,440
heterogeneous. It's very spatially

143
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
concentrated and very rapid. So, if we

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,199
return to our example of uh

145
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
deforestation

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,440
in the Amazon, we can see that the the

147
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,360
the deforestation is very rapid but very

148
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,919
patchy as well. There's still places in

149
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,160
the forest that are being maintained

150
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,400
even after deforestation has been rot on

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,400
all sides.

152
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
There are yet more challenges when we're

153
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
talking about ecological modeling

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,800
specifically when we're trying to

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,320
understand commal communities. One

156
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,320
additional challenge is habitat

157
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,800
fragmentation like this Ontario boreal

158
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,240
forest. And you can really only best

159
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,080
resolve the effects of habitat

160
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
fragmentation at very spine spatial

161
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,199
scales. So as you can see here only a

162
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
few hundred meter resolutions is the

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,680
difference between no forest and a

164
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
healthy community.

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
Additionally there's challenges with

166
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
community turnover. So this is a Swiss

167
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,479
alpine grassland. You can see here on

168
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,000
the right. What the issue with community

169
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,240
turnover is is that population

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,479
fluctuations between individual species

171
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
may ultimately cancel each other out

172
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,800
when measuring with traditional

173
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
biodiversity statistics. Therefore, we

174
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
may miss changes that are happening at

175
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
the community level as these

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,919
fluctuations cancel each other across

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,039
species. Therefore, when we're really

178
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
trying to think about monitoring

179
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,639
progress towards the Kig Montreal

180
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,479
Accords and trying to synthesize across

181
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,639
all of these change drivers with our B

182
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,919
biodiversity monitoring methods, it

183
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,600
becomes clear that we really need new

184
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,199
sources of data and new models and

185
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
methods to work with said data in order

186
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,000
for us to comprehensively track these

187
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,280
changes in the 21st century. So, this is

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
where the idea of foundation models

189
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,120
comes in. So, foundation models are a

190
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,880
new datadriven machine learning paradigm

191
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,960
that have led to rapid advancements in

192
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,720
the sciences of just the past few years.

193
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
Things such as protein folding, climate

194
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,600
prediction, and the now ubiquitous

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,440
language modeling that we all know of,

196
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,199
which powers products like Chat, GPT,

197
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,520
Claude, and Gemini that are being used

198
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,120
by millions daily.

199
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,960
And so, the central tenant of foundation

200
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,759
models are deep learning models trained

201
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,160
on lots of large scale albeit noisy data

202
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,800
such as text, images, and speech. These

203
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,639
data are then we take a a deep learning

204
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
model and then use a shockingly simple

205
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,560
objective to try and learn the

206
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,080
representation of these of this data. So

207
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,520
for example for language modeling it

208
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,360
would be simply predicting the next word

209
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,759
in the sentence for this example which

210
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,840
would be dog. Through these seemingly

211
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,440
simple tasks, these models nevertheless

212
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
learn complex statistical patterns

213
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,960
across these large collections of data.

214
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,639
Patterns which end up being widely

215
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
generalizable and adaptable for many

216
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
downstream tasks such as chatupt's

217
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,639
ability to answer questions, follow

218
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,880
instructions, and caption images from

219
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,639
just a few examples.

220
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,440
These exciting advancements along with

221
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,280
other recent successes across the bi uh

222
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,280
across biological domains such as

223
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,120
sequence foundation models like ESM3 and

224
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,880
EVO have made it a question of when not

225
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
if similar approaches will lead to major

226
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,000
breakthroughs in ecology and

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,520
environmental science.

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,280
And indeed there has been a recent rise

229
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,759
in these biodiversity focused foundation

230
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,039
models just in the past few years uh and

231
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
especially building out these foundation

232
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,360
model scale data sets. So we have things

233
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,599
like wildlife insights and I naturalists

234
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,319
and other sources as well from acoustics

235
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,680
data to remote sensing. And so my

236
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,280
research really centers around how we

237
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
can start to build these biodiversity

238
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,560
foundation models and how can we start

239
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,039
to curate these data sets in a way that

240
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,319
we can use them ultimately for automated

241
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,919
biodiversity monitoring in the

242
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
anthroposine.

243
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,120
So towards that goal today I'm going to

244
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
talk to you about some of the

245
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
opportunities that we have for adopting

246
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,440
a foundational model approach towards

247
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,199
this task but also some of the

248
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,199
outstanding challenges that lie in our

249
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,039
way. So first I'll start with the

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,479
opportunities which ex includes

251
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,800
exploring how these foundation models

252
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,400
can be actually used to detect the biode

253
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
change at fine spatial and temporal

254
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,319
resolutions. And so for that in the

255
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,400
first chapter I'll present the biosphere

256
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
which is a model from my PhD that we can

257
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
use to predict plant species occurrences

258
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,599
from satellite imagery and citizen

259
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
science data and use that to ultimately

260
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,919
detect biodiversity change across time

261
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
and space. However, many areas of the

262
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,760
world lack large volumes of reliably

263
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,919
labeled data like what we use in order

264
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
to train deep biosphere, especially in

265
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,200
the global south where a lot of the

266
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,320
world's biodiversity is located. So, in

267
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,839
the next section, I'm going to talk

268
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
about the opportunities that we have to

269
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,240
leverage both ecological relationships

270
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and self-supervised learning to improve

271
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,399
foundation models representations of the

272
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
natural world. Lastly, we're going to

273
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,120
switch gears a bit and now we're going

274
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
to focus on some of the challenges,

275
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
these outstanding challenges towards um

276
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,680
operationalizing the datadriven approach

277
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,040
of foundation models, which includes

278
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
that the patterns that these models

279
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,279
learn by nature reflect the biases of

280
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,920
their training data and biodiversity

281
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,080
data especially contains many known and

282
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,760
strong biases. So for this last section,

283
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll discuss div shift which is a new

284
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,160
framework and data set for quantifying

285
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,959
the impact of biodiversity specific bias

286
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
on foundational model performance. So

287
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
just to kick things off first, let's

288
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
dive into the potential that we can have

289
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
for building foundation models for

290
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,120
biodiversity monitoring. And as y'all

291
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
might remember from just a few slides

292
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,640
earlier, one of the few central tenants

293
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,040
of foundation models is the need for

294
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
data and the need for lots of data. But

295
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,320
thankfully across the natural world, we

296
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
now have open and citizen science

297
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
initiatives like I naturalist and eird

298
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
which are generating tens to hundreds of

299
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,040
millions of biodiversity records yearly

300
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,200
across the globe. Similarly, for high

301
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,880
resol high resolution environmental

302
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,480
predictors, we also can turn to remote

303
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,080
sensing data which has high spatial

304
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,680
resolution as we can see here on the

305
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
left. You can actually start to see the

306
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,839
individual tree troughs of old growth

307
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,519
redwoods in Northern California, but it

308
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,040
also has high temporal resolution as

309
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
well, which we can see with the return

310
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,720
of wetlands after a marsh restoration

311
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,320
project in northeastern California on

312
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,839
the right.

313
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
So in order for us to leverage both of

314
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,079
these data sources for this we first

315
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,320
curated a new machine learning optimized

316
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,880
data set of over 650,000 plant

317
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
observations taken from I natural NG

318
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,920
BIFF across the state of California

319
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,320
which is what you can see here on the

320
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,079
left. We then pair these I naturalist

321
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
observations with highresolution remote

322
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,320
sensing images from the national

323
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,240
agricultural imagery program and further

324
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,680
also include pointwise climate variables

325
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
since climate is an important predictor

326
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,680
of species distributions to aid in

327
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,040
training and enable simultaneous

328
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
modeling of multiple species

329
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,519
simultaneously. We also impute nearby

330
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,560
species information turning this into a

331
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,839
weak multi-lel setting. So as you just

332
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
saw the climate data that we're working

333
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,160
with and the remote sensing data that

334
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,839
we're working with come at very

335
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,200
different spatial resolutions. And so

336
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,279
for us to better handle these different

337
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,880
spatial scales, we also worked on

338
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,640
building a new two-headed neural network

339
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,880
architecture which we colloally refer to

340
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,279
as deep biosphere which is able to

341
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,800
extract 2D spatial patterns and using a

342
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,279
convolutional neural network from the

343
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,640
remote sensing data and ensembles them

344
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,320
with pointwise predictions of the

345
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,680
climate data using a simple multi-layer

346
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,160
perceptron which you can see along the

347
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,600
top in this diagram. We also, as you may

348
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
see, include higher toxinomic

349
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,880
information during training for both for

350
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,120
species including their genus and

351
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,800
family, which helps to improve overall

352
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
accuracy, especially for rare species

353
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,040
who may share information with the with

354
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,920
more with species with more observations

355
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,600
from their genus and family.

356
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,040
However, because the biodiversity data

357
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,040
that we're using to build this data set

358
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,519
is largely from opportunistic citizen

359
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,440
science campaigns, what this means is

360
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,640
that most of the remote sensing images

361
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,000
in our data set are lacking labels for

362
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,000
most of the species that are actually

363
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,399
present on the ground. So, as we can see

364
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,560
here, on average, only one or two

365
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,040
species have been identified in the I

366
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,880
naturalist app for every image in our

367
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,640
data set. even though we know that there

368
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,040
on average more than 100 species are

369
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,800
present in any given 250 meter square

370
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,360
foot area that represents one of the

371
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,680
images in our training set.

372
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,360
But given that there's over 200 2200

373
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
classes in our data set, what this means

374
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,519
is that when we're using standard binary

375
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,440
cross entropy loss, which is the typical

376
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,639
loss in a multilel supervised setting,

377
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
the fact that there are many more

378
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,160
species than there are absent than there

379
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,600
are present in a given image means that

380
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,079
we're biasing our network to learn what

381
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,839
species are absent. But again, because

382
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,600
there many species have not yet been

383
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,279
observed on the I naturalist data set

384
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
despite actually being present on the

385
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,519
ground, this means that when we're

386
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,519
learning species absence, the number of

387
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
pseudo absences overwhelms the number of

388
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,519
actual true absences on the ground in

389
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,200
the signal that the model is learning.

390
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,120
And so the model will be biased to learn

391
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
what species are absent versus what are

392
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,519
not present, but only for observations

393
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,240
that have lots of data. And this is

394
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
again a problem when we're dealing in

395
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,760
this imbalanced data labeling setting.

396
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,360
So to help deal with this imbalance,

397
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,360
what we introduced is a sampling aware

398
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800
binary cross entropy loss which

399
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
essentially rescales the loss

400
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,680
contribution of present versus absent

401
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,760
classes for every sample depending on a

402
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,000
given area sampling effort. What this

403
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,240
means is that areas with few I

404
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
naturalist observations. The model is

405
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,160
then focused on learning the species

406
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,480
that we do know are present versus areas

407
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079
with a high sampling density, we're

408
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,399
going to focus learning on those species

409
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,160
that actually are most likely absent in

410
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,560
in that given area.

411
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,639
So after hyperparameter tuning and uh

412
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
many ablation studies we ultimately

413
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,760
found that by combining our new

414
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,440
architecture loss function pre-training

415
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,440
data set which we colllocally referred

416
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,800
to as deep biosphere in general this

417
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
outperformed a broad array of

418
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
traditional species distribution

419
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,240
modeling appro approaches including

420
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,600
classic climate only approaches like max

421
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
and random forest which you can see here

422
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,519
in dark blue but along with remote

423
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,480
sensing only deep learning methods like

424
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,160
in the inception light the inception net

425
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,160
model which you can see in light blue

426
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
and additionally the remote sensing only

427
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,839
component of deep biosphere which you

428
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,440
can see in yellow.

429
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,199
Deep biosphere significantly improves

430
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
modeling performances across species and

431
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,839
geography as measured across dozens of

432
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,600
accuracy metrics including recall or the

433
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,279
number of species is correctly correctly

434
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
predicted as present and which you can

435
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,160
see here on the left which we improved

436
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,639
accuracy by on average 47% over the

437
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,240
baselines. We also check we also

438
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
compared against area under the receiver

439
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
operator characteristic curve which we

440
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,360
can see here in the middle which is a

441
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,720
measure of precision varying under

442
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,320
various um um detection thresholds which

443
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,560
again shows a sustained and significant

444
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,480
improvement for all species including

445
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,959
the rare species with h which have fewer

446
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,320
than 100 observations in our data set

447
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,760
and other metrics that are common to the

448
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
machine learning community like top 100

449
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
per species accuracy which we can see

450
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
here on the right which again shows a

451
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,839
sustained and significant improvement of

452
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,120
4 to 65% per species.

453
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
But when we're going from just improving

454
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,000
accuracy and accuracy metrics to

455
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
actually using an approach like deep

456
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,360
biosphere for for monitoring

457
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,880
biodiversity

458
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,560
um we'll focus on a case study first to

459
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,320
see how these methods can unlock new

460
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,600
monitoring potential focusing

461
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,360
specifically on the northern

462
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,639
California's redwood forests which you

463
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,120
can see here on the left. Um redwoods

464
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,880
contain uh there's only less than 5% of

465
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,720
old growth redwood forests still remain

466
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,480
in their natural habitat after 20th

467
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
century clear cutting. And you can see

468
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,800
some of this 5% of remaining old growth

469
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,480
redwood forest is this thin band of dark

470
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,639
olive running along the right side of

471
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,560
Redwood Creek which you can see here.

472
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,880
These tall old growth trees are so

473
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480
easily visible that we can actually have

474
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,079
humans annotate them and they can

475
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
accurately detect these old growth

476
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,959
groves from satellite imagery. However,

477
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,920
if we take deep biosphere and we impute

478
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,839
it um make predictions across this image

479
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,760
to generate a species presence map for

480
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,480
redwoods, we see that the predicted

481
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,800
presence of redwoods is much more um has

482
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
a much broader extent with the model

483
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,199
than compared to the human annotations

484
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
of old growth redwoods. But if we

485
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,720
actually do take the National Park

486
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,320
Services fine scale vegetation map for

487
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
the area, what we see is that most of

488
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,000
this area is indeed covered by redwood

489
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,160
forests, but it's covered by redwood

490
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,160
forests of two different ages.

491
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
Specifically in red is the old growth

492
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,680
groves that our human annotators are

493
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,079
very good at detecting. So this area

494
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,320
right here. But additionally these areas

495
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,320
in blue are redwood groves but these are

496
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,480
groves regrowing after clear cutting in

497
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
the 20th century.

498
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,839
And so what we see is that deep

499
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,839
bossphere was indeed the only modeling

500
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,759
approach that we tested which was able

501
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
to consistently predict all redwood

502
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,240
containing pixels as accurately

503
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,320
containing redwoods and in and showed an

504
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,880
average improvement of 75% over all

505
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,639
other methods. But beyond large

506
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,000
charismatic overstory species like

507
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,759
redwoods which are easy to see from

508
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,399
remote sensing imagery. If we want to

509
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,160
start also looking below the canopy we

510
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,160
we can also see that deep biosphere can

511
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,920
also detect where understory species

512
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,079
were more likely to grow based on the

513
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,480
relationship with their overstory

514
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,040
species

515
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
ex including examples like rubasar sinus

516
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,519
pacific blackberry which we can see here

517
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,920
on the top from this example and as well

518
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,399
as redwood sorrel oxalos orana here on

519
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,639
the bottom. These two species show very

520
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,640
strong associations with either old

521
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,839
growth redwoods or new growth redwoods

522
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,600
and weak associations with the opposite.

523
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,439
And so then if we take deep biosphere's

524
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,039
predictions for these two species and

525
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
project them across this landscape as

526
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,600
well, we see that deep biosphere on

527
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,600
average predicts rubiser sinus more

528
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,199
often with a higher predicted

529
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,559
probability than oxalis orana in pixels

530
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
that are mapped as secondary growth

531
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,200
redwoods and vice versa for oxalis orana

532
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,280
in the old growth redwoods. This is

533
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,960
additionally matched to field validated

534
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,720
studies of the relationship between

535
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,000
these species in these sporests areas

536
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,240
with additional case studies from

537
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,840
traperal species in southern California.

538
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
In general, we see the deep biosphere is

539
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,360
able to pick out these patterns not just

540
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,360
of the oversource species but also the

541
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
species that we can't directly detect

542
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,840
from remote sensing imagery that they

543
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,760
are associated with which is exciting.

544
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,520
Now, when we're talking about

545
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,520
biodiversity monitoring, we're talking

546
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
about trying to detect change, right?

547
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,960
And so when we're trying to think about

548
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
predicting spatial biodiversity change,

549
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,880
we can again leverage Deep Biosphere's

550
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
learned features in order to map spatial

551
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
change across the landscape. In this

552
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,280
case, what we're doing is we're

553
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,880
comparing local change and deep

554
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,160
biosphere's predicted presence across

555
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,080
2200 plant species here on the right.

556
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
And what we see is that if we actually

557
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,080
then compare how those change how those

558
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,240
pro probabilities change across

559
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,679
individual points in the landscape, we

560
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
can actually measure the intensity of

561
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,360
spatial turnover across the highly

562
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
heterogeneous Marin County, California

563
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,039
here on the left. So this is the map for

564
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,360
this area um developed with deep

565
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,039
biosphere. What's exciting is that these

566
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,799
spatial turnover estimates correlate

567
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,280
strongly with independently measured

568
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,200
maps of vegetation trip across the area,

569
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,600
which means that regions of high spatial

570
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,320
turnover on average do have more unique

571
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,840
vegetation types in that given area. Um,

572
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,760
suggesting that these are areas that are

573
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,120
exhibiting strong spatial turnover.

574
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,600
Now towards predicting temporal

575
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,880
biodiversity change with a biosphere.

576
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,280
Again, we're going to focus on a case

577
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
study, but this time in the 2013 in the

578
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,799
Sierra Foothills of California,

579
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,200
specifically the 2013 Rim wildfire.

580
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,000
If we you which you can probably see

581
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,640
hopefully has a pretty strong a pretty

582
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,600
um obvious burn scar um here using

583
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,039
imagery taken from 2014. If we aggregate

584
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,120
changes in deep bossphere's predicted

585
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,039
presence for all 2200 species, but doing

586
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,039
so across time, so essentially comparing

587
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,200
predictions from imagery taken in 2012

588
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,320
versus imagery take before the fire to

589
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,440
imagery taken in 2014 after the fire, we

590
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,440
see that in on general the areas with

591
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,039
predicted change tend to visually

592
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,919
correlate with areas that have a higher

593
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,360
amount of burn scar um left over after

594
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,600
the fire. from the remote sensing

595
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,640
imagery on the left. We can actually

596
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,200
then see that these uh these estimates

597
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,880
not just visually seem to agree but also

598
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,559
uh empirically agree as well with

599
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,160
independently measured empirical burn

600
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,840
severity metrics which you can see here

601
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,760
on the left. Um oops sorry. And so this

602
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,360
shows a promising example of how we can

603
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,039
use these methods potentially to track

604
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,000
high resolution changes in natural

605
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,840
communities across space and time.

606
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,679
If we start to look more broadly across

607
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,120
the landscape to explore deep

608
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,760
biosphere's potential to capture

609
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,679
biodiversity change at ecosystem scales,

610
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,679
we can also map the short-term temporal

611
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,760
change across the entire state. And if

612
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,080
we actually zoom into the uh Sierra

613
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,600
Nevada region, eco region of the of

614
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,760
California here in the middle of the

615
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,120
state, we can see that there appears to

616
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,280
be a band of increased difference along

617
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,600
the western foothills of this of the

618
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,120
Sika region across the western foothills

619
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,880
of the of the Sierra Nevada

620
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
specifically.

621
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,840
Interestingly enough, this is actually

622
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
an area that is undergoing what we call

623
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
vegetation climate mismatch. And so the

624
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
plants that are living here, the

625
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,720
communities that are present um are now

626
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,240
out of equilibrium with their climate.

627
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,159
It is too hot and too dry for many of

628
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,559
these species to exist, but the forest

629
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,600
hasn't fully transitioned into um a

630
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,360
grass parkland like ecosystem.

631
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,520
What's exciting is that if we actually

632
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,000
map out Deep Biosphere's predictions of

633
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,320
change across time, we see that pixels

634
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that are mapped to have high vegetation

635
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,760
climate mismatch from this independent

636
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
study have a significantly higher

637
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,360
predicted change when when looking at

638
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,080
deep biosphere change prediction

639
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,440
features change predictions providing

640
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
further evidence that biodiversity

641
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,880
foundation models can be used to

642
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,280
potentially track biodiversity change at

643
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,200
continental scales.

644
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,640
So to summarize, deepphere is a new

645
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
foundation model like approach for

646
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,400
mapping species distributions across

647
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,840
space and time. Deeposphere can detect

648
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
the presence of thousands of plant

649
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,840
species simultaneously from remote

650
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,760
sensing imagery and can further estimate

651
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,919
their changes in space and time at high

652
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,679
resolution. All from large scale noisy

653
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,799
citizen science observations and remote

654
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,039
sensing data. Oh, forgot to click there.

655
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,200
Sorry about that.

656
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,120
So next we'll talk about how we can

657
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,039
leverage both ecological relationships

658
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,480
and self-supervised learning to improve

659
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,799
foundation models of the natural world

660
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,120
where biodiversity data is sparse much

661
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,400
sparer than what we see in California.

662
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,400
This is important because public

663
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
biodiversity data is not distributed

664
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,000
evenly worldwide.

665
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,919
If we take our research grade I

666
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,159
naturalist observations availability by

667
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,000
continent we see that the vast majority

668
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,799
of I naturalist observations actually

669
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,400
come from above the tropic of cancer.

670
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,840
While the we know that the vast majority

671
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
of the world's biodiversity is actually

672
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,600
found below the tropic of cancer in

673
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,640
subsaharan Africa, South America,

674
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,320
Southeast Asia, etc. And in fact, if we

675
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,400
focus on California, specifically the

676
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,880
example that I just showed you, our

677
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,400
focus um area of study for deep virus

678
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,919
here, we see that I naturalist

679
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,760
observations are more than 10 times

680
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,919
dense in California than the rest of the

681
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,159
world combined. So, in the face of such

682
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,440
little highquality label data, what

683
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,600
other sources of data could we

684
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,880
potentially leverage instead? Well,

685
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
thankfully the internet has lots of

686
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
images of the natural world taken all

687
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,159
over the planet with public sources like

688
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,840
Google Street View and Lion 5B topping

689
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,559
over 5 billion images of the built-in

690
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,760
natural world. This then motivates uh

691
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,280
the question of how can we actually

692
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
leverage these photos of the natural

693
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,720
world even if we don't have explicit

694
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,799
labels of what species are present in

695
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
them.

696
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,480
But even if we lack specific labels,

697
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,320
nevertheless, biogeography can still

698
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,159
help. Specifically, the ecological

699
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,240
insight that species form and function

700
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,320
are shaped by their local environment.

701
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
For example, many clarkas, which is a

702
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,360
type of plant as you can see here on the

703
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,280
bottom, have evolved traits that have

704
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,840
enabled them to survive in the hot and

705
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,720
dry southern chapel ecosystem of

706
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,559
California. Similarly, tamarisk, which

707
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
is a a tree species you can see here in

708
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,240
the middle, it has also evolved traits

709
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,840
that have helped to expand across the

710
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,240
dry desert southwest of the United

711
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,159
States. And in general, we can see that

712
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,440
the closer species and a region are to

713
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,080
one another, the more similar they look

714
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
and vice versa. This is a relationship

715
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,799
that the wing can then exploit in our

716
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,120
model pre-training process.

717
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,799
Leveraging this ecological relationship,

718
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,720
we developed contrast of image remote

719
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,080
sensing pre-training or crisp for short,

720
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,600
a new representation learning

721
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,039
pre-training strategy that learns a

722
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,039
joint representation space between

723
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,520
ground level and aerial views of plant

724
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,360
species. For crisp pre-training, what we

725
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,039
do is we first pair each I naturalist

726
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,440
ground level image with a remote sensing

727
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,240
image from the same location. We then

728
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,240
pass these through um an encoder and

729
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,000
then for both the ground level and

730
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,760
remote sensing image and then based on

731
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,440
this ecological insight that ground

732
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,440
level and remote sensing views from the

733
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,919
same locations should look more similar

734
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
than images from other locations. We use

735
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,799
the clip loss which we can see here on

736
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
the left to train both the remote

737
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,480
sensing and ground level encoders so

738
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
that paired ground level and remote

739
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,880
sensing image embeddings are more

740
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,000
similar than unpaired image embeddings

741
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,679
which you can see along the red

742
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
diagonal. So we want our images from the

743
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,279
same location in green to have a more

744
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,640
similar representation from images taken

745
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,640
from different locations.

746
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,240
However, since users can upload more

747
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,799
than one photo to an a given I

748
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,720
naturalist observation at a time, some

749
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,559
images in a batch may be from the same

750
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,279
location.

751
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,200
So for this what we do is we um expand

752
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,120
the crisp loss to include any other

753
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,120
observation taken from the same location

754
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,039
as considered to be a positive in this

755
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,480
case. So for this example, we can see

756
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,919
that the first and the fourth images

757
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
were taken from the same geographic

758
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,440
location. So then when we're calculating

759
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,200
the clip loss, we're going to consider

760
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,640
those paired images as well to be

761
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,320
positives in this case. We want those

762
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,760
representations to be similar too.

763
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,440
Lastly, since the ground level and

764
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,000
remote sensing views may not be equally

765
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,520
informative as expressed by the 1/2 and

766
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,919
the base crisp loss, which you can see

767
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,360
here in yellow, we also introduce a

768
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,799
parameterized version of the clip loss

769
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,080
that differentially weights the

770
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,679
contribution of the ground level and

771
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,840
remote sensing loss components

772
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,960
respectively and dynamically learn this

773
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,159
as training evolves, which then enables

774
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,679
the model to learn from the most

775
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,080
informative data source throughout the

776
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,440
pre-training process. Most importantly,

777
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
you'll see at no point during this

778
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,799
pre-training process do we actually need

779
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,960
labels of what species are present in

780
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,400
these images. All we need is an image

781
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,760
from the ground and an image from above

782
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,279
in order for us to train our model.

783
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,720
For us to empirically test this

784
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,440
approach, we also developed the new

785
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,279
nature m nature multiv- view data set

786
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,039
which contains almost 2 million image

787
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,440
eye naturalist observations from across

788
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,760
California for more than 3 million eye

789
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
naturalist observations. These images,

790
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,120
which you can see here on the top, are

791
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,440
then paired with remote sensing images

792
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,240
from National Agricultural Imagery

793
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,240
Program for over 6,500 plant species

794
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,600
from across California. Now, you might

795
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,360
remember I said California has a lot

796
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,440
more naturalist data than most places in

797
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,760
the world,

798
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,480
um, which is represented by the box in

799
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,400
gray. So for us to more closely map to

800
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,400
the biodiversity data availability for

801
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,919
the rest of the globe, we also test the

802
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,520
model's downstream accuracy using

803
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,080
progressively smaller subsamples of

804
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,559
these 2 million research grade images.

805
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,919
And these subsamples roughly m match the

806
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,840
data densities similar to other

807
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,720
continents like Oceanania, Europe,

808
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,240
Africa and Asia respectively.

809
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,679
Challenges of this data set include that

810
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,679
it covers a large diversity of

811
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,919
phenotypes and habitats as we can see

812
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,919
clearly from the imagery. But it also

813
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,600
has a strong taxonomic imbalance as

814
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,200
well. So if we plot the number of

815
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,720
observations per species, we see that

816
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,240
most species have few observations and

817
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,799
few species have a lot of observations

818
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,640
in our data set. Lastly, our data set

819
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,400
has a strong geographic skew where most

820
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,400
observations come from just one eco

821
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,120
region which is near which contains both

822
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,960
LA and San Francisco despite not

823
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,360
covering covering less than half of uh

824
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,080
California's land mass.

825
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,919
So with these challenges in mind,

826
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,600
nevertheless with the nature multiview

827
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,039
data set, we're able to test the model's

828
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,799
performance on a wide variety of

829
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,960
downstream biodiversity monitoring

830
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,480
tasks. The first being species

831
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,640
recognition where the models are tasked

832
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,200
to identify what species is present in a

833
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,960
given ground level image as we can see

834
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,080
along the bottom. So if we compare the

835
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,640
crisp pre-trained encoder fine-tuned on

836
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,000
on progressively smaller subsamples of

837
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,600
our labeled data to in comparing it to a

838
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,919
variety of self-supervised and fully

839
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,520
supervised machine learning approaches,

840
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,520
we see that crisp pre-training often

841
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,559
improves downstream species recognition

842
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,799
accuracy especially on the smallest bits

843
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,720
sorry splits of data that mimic I

844
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,159
naturalist availability in the in

845
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,840
continents such as Asia and South

846
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,679
America.

847
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,039
For these data density splits, we see

848
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,679
that crisp pre-training improves

849
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,520
performance on average of 23% when cons

850
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,240
comparing all examples equally. As you

851
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,440
can see here, up to 14% when comparing

852
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,279
accuracy per species, uh sorry, up to 7%

853
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,440
when considering accuracies per species

854
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,279
and up to 14% per eco region.

855
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,279
So with improvement gains concentrated

856
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,360
again on the most lowest density data

857
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,360
splits, what this implies then is that

858
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,039
the crisp pre-training process provides

859
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,399
the most downstream benefit with the

860
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,000
least amount of label data.

861
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,600
Similarly for species distribution

862
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
mapping, which is where a model is

863
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,399
trying to predict what species is

864
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,320
present in a given remote sensing

865
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,919
imagery, we see again that crisp

866
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,520
pre-training often improves downstream

867
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,399
species distribution mapping performance

868
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,120
as well. And again, most clearly for the

869
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,399
smallest data densities.

870
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,080
This is especially true when we're

871
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,840
considering the rarity of species when

872
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,399
we're calculating accuracy, which is

873
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,559
important in our longtail longtail data

874
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,200
scenario. Again, where most species are

875
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,799
rare and few species are common. If we

876
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,279
further break down this per species

877
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,679
accuracy into frequent, common, and rare

878
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,200
species, we see that the biggest jump in

879
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
improvement is actually for the rarest

880
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,640
species in our data set. These are

881
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,600
species with less than 200 observations

882
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,440
in total from our original data set. And

883
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,600
yes, even though the overall accuracy is

884
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,000
low for these species and especially for

885
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,520
the lowest splits, we again see the most

886
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,840
important thing is that the improvement

887
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,640
over the baseline accuracy of on average

888
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,640
0% is significant because these rare

889
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,000
species are the ones that often times

890
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,919
that we want to monitor in a

891
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,520
biodiversity monitoring setting. So any

892
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,399
improvement whatsoever is important in

893
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,760
this space.

894
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,760
Scaling this approach to continental

895
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,600
levels, we also tested crisp downstream

896
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,200
transferability using the auto arborist

897
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,960
data set which provides both ground

898
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,440
level and aerial images for over 3

899
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,960
million urban trees across 300 general

900
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,880
from 23 cities in the US and Canada.

901
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,480
Pre-training with the crisp pre-training

902
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,000
with crisp on this data set also leads

903
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,919
to uniformly higher downstream

904
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,080
performance on cities unseen during both

905
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,840
pre-training and fine-tuning and for

906
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,840
cities coast to coast. So these are the

907
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,919
three three cities from three regions of

908
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,600
the United States, Central, West, and

909
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,039
East.

910
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,360
More qualitatively, if we actually

911
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,760
visualize the remote sensing encoder

912
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,840
from the pre-training process and do so

913
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,600
for a random subset of images across the

914
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,720
state, we see that in general, images

915
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,480
that are closer to one another

916
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,039
geographically tend to look more similar

917
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,640
in embedding space, but not always. Such

918
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,559
as this example from the central basin

919
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
arranged in the sonor and desert. Even

920
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,679
though geographically these areas are

921
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,360
far apart, their vegetation structure

922
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,120
and species composition are actually

923
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,000
quite similar both visually and in

924
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,679
embedding space. We can also visualize

925
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,840
the ground level encoder across the tree

926
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,440
of life by mapping the average embedding

927
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,600
per genus and again see that more

928
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,919
closely related species visually appear

929
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,679
to have more similar representations

930
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,600
such as these two gymnosperms from my

931
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,760
original example um from the remote

932
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,279
sensing encoder. But these embedding

933
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,279
similarities are not just driven by

934
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,200
simple features like color but also more

935
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,880
complex phenotypic traits like similar

936
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,640
flower structure for broodier. You can

937
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,640
see here that these flowers are all five

938
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,600
leveled and have this this veination

939
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,000
coming off of the the center of the

940
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,080
flower but also the succulent pads of a

941
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,320
punch and ferocus in the cactier family.

942
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,120
So even without an explicit signal for

943
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,120
so in the training process

944
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,480
um using a crisp pre-training approach

945
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,399
the model um is able to learn these

946
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,080
ecological relationships just like

947
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,080
chatpt's next word prediction

948
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,559
pre-training task can model a wide

949
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,519
variety of linguistic phenomena without

950
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,200
explicit training signals for them.

951
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,480
So to summarize, Chris multimodal

952
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,240
pre-training improves downstream

953
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,640
classification accuracy for a diverse

954
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,080
array of natural world tasks and also

955
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,000
enables us to leverage natural world

956
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,080
imagery even if no labels are present

957
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,519
for set images, showing the power

958
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,200
promise of foundation model approaches

959
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,519
for biodiversity monitoring even when

960
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,679
label data is scarce.

961
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,519
Now we're going to um oops, I forgot to

962
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,360
click again. So now we're going to

963
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,039
switch gears one more time and dive into

964
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,880
some of the challenges that um that

965
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,760
still nevertheless uh face these

966
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,799
approaches for biodiversity monitoring.

967
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,880
And we're going to start with the fact

968
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,120
that biodiversity data, the data that

969
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,640
underpins the most of these these models

970
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,200
and approaches contains many

971
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,279
well-documented biases.

972
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,399
And even traditional biodiversity

973
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,000
monitoring and uh modeling approaches

974
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,840
have challenges of dealing with these

975
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,360
biases

976
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,600
and in in also leave foundation models

977
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,320
in general with a worse understanding of

978
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,760
the natural world. Specifically in the

979
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,000
realm of computer vision, these these

980
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,919
biases are are are even more complex

981
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,760
typified by this example of a butterfly

982
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,799
for my naturalist because what we're

983
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,919
trying to do is we're trying to figure

984
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,159
out what the model is trying to figure

985
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,679
out what species is present in image.

986
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,360
But sometimes images will actually

987
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,360
contain more than one species at a time.

988
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,640
So for this example, it's unclear what

989
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,919
from the model's perspective which

990
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,679
butterfly it should predict because

991
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,279
there's two butterflies that are clearly

992
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,200
visible. But for us, it's very obvious

993
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,799
which one matches to a species

994
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,799
observation.

995
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,799
Um,

996
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,600
so to to try and concretize a bit some

997
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,200
of these different biases, the volunteer

998
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,039
collected biodiversity data that I've

999
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,840
been showing you from from products like

1000
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,600
I naturalist and EIRD. These types of uh

1001
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,600
products are especially biased as well

1002
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,840
across five specific axes that we'll

1003
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,399
explore today. This includes spatial

1004
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,480
bias which means that observers tend to

1005
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,440
prefer easy to access green spaces in

1006
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,760
urban areas. Temporal biases such as

1007
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,399
non-ecological spikes from biiob blitz

1008
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,080
events or on the weekends. Observer bias

1009
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,840
which means that most observations come

1010
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,679
from a small but dedicated group of

1011
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,720
users that tend to observe more species

1012
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,399
in more diverse habitats. Taxonomic bias

1013
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,159
which includes a preference for larger

1014
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,320
and more charismatic species when people

1015
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,799
are taking observations. And also

1016
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,960
finally sociopolitical bias where who

1017
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,480
has access to the resources, time and

1018
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,720
areas to collect biodiversity

1019
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,679
observations includes skews towards

1020
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,279
wider wealthier and older observers. But

1021
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,519
for us to actually go from knowing that

1022
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,320
these biases exist to quantifying their

1023
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,440
effects on model performance. We then

1024
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,359
developed a new framework called

1025
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,359
diversity diff shift or diff shift for

1026
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,679
short that cast these biases as a

1027
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,760
distribution shift problem. Essentially

1028
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,280
given D which is our observation sampled

1029
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,919
in a biased way from the broader

1030
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,919
biodiversity across the landscape J what

1031
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,639
we're going to do is partition D into P

1032
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,800
A and PB depending on some known bias in

1033
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,639
in in our data such as for example for

1034
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,320
temporal bias observations tend to be

1035
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,919
taken on the week versus the week or the

1036
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
weekend versus during the week work

1037
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,720
week. What we can then do is compare the

1038
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,119
the distribution shift in label space

1039
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,240
between PA and PB to changes in a deep

1040
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,919
learning model's performance when

1041
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,079
training on one partition and testing on

1042
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,839
another and quantify how different the

1043
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,359
how different the distributions are in

1044
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,359
label space using genten Shannon

1045
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,040
divergence between the labels in PA and

1046
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,119
PB and vice versa. We can then compare

1047
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,119
this label divergence to the model

1048
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,359
performance as well and even to expert

1049
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,720
derived me measures of um abundance for

1050
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,960
get different communities in these

1051
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,480
examples to help us ground how much

1052
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,760
performance change is expected

1053
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,520
ecologically versus unusual

1054
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
to help test this approach with real

1055
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,599
world volunteer collected biodiversity

1056
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,119
data. We again focus on on North America

1057
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,599
and we collect specifically the diff

1058
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,839
shift North American West Coast data set

1059
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,000
which is over 7.3 million images of more

1060
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,920
than 7,500 plant species again from my

1061
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,800
naturalists across 11 states across the

1062
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,320
western US. These observations cover

1063
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
seven of the world's nine terrestrial

1064
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,480
biomes and include some of the coldest,

1065
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,440
hottest, driest, and wetest places on

1066
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,520
Earth. Additionally, it covers a a high

1067
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,680
variation in socioeconomic status as

1068
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,440
well, including California's GDP of over

1069
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,200
3.6 6 trillion the 2024 uh 2023 to Baja

1070
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,359
California surge GDP of only 13 billion.

1071
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,119
Um for this analysis what we do is we

1072
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,839
partition the div shift knock data set

1073
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,200
across the five biases that I introduced

1074
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,480
earlier. And for the sake of time I'm

1075
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,920
only going to cover three of the five

1076
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,280
biases that we introduced but if you

1077
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,720
have questions I'm happy to talk about

1078
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,400
the other two later in the Q&A session.

1079
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
So for the first bias, we're going to f

1080
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,440
focus back on spatial bias, which

1081
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,760
includes again a skew towards more

1082
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
observations tend to be taken in easy to

1083
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,720
access metropolitin parks rather than

1084
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,160
hard-to-reach wilderness areas.

1085
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,920
We can see this very clearly in the div

1086
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,839
shift knock data set from this histogram

1087
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
that you can see here. Different knock

1088
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,960
observations, what we can see here on

1089
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,720
the bottom, have a significantly

1090
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,640
stronger skew towards more modified

1091
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,119
areas as measured by the human footprint

1092
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,119
index versus if we compare that to the

1093
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,320
total land mass of all the areas of the

1094
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,760
states that are included in the div

1095
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,920
shift knock data set, we can see that

1096
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,599
these areas tend to be overwhelmingly

1097
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,520
wilderness thanks in large part to

1098
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,880
Alaska's large um geographic extent.

1099
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,240
For this partition, we therefore

1100
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,599
partition the div shift knock

1101
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,599
observations into as the human footprint

1102
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,800
index describes wilderness and highly

1103
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,560
modified observations. So blue being

1104
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,440
highly modified and orange being

1105
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,280
wilderness regions. As we if we actually

1106
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,200
dis um plot out the number of

1107
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,800
observations we have per species across

1108
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,040
these two data sets or these two

1109
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,599
partitions of our data set specifically,

1110
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,200
we see that there is nearly

1111
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,400
uh 10 times more data from human

1112
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,839
modified regions as compared to

1113
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,680
wilderness regions for nearly three

1114
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,119
times as many species, which really

1115
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,640
highlights just how underrepresented

1116
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,400
these wilderness regions are in

1117
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,640
volunteer collected biodiversity data

1118
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,160
sets.

1119
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,680
Applying the div shift framework to this

1120
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,200
partition, we see that on average

1121
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,960
training on observations from less

1122
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,599
disturbed habitats in orange. So these

1123
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,359
two parts you can see here tends to lead

1124
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,960
to a uniformly worse performance than

1125
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,880
training on observations from both area

1126
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,680
from areas of high human activity in

1127
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,359
blue. This is using testing test

1128
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,359
observations from both human modified

1129
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,119
and wilderness regions. This is again

1130
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,720
likely due to the significantly larger

1131
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,160
size of the modified training portion.

1132
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,079
There's simply more observations for the

1133
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,240
model to learn a good signal from.

1134
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,599
However, if we actually only look at

1135
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,200
species that are most common in

1136
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,440
wilderness regions, as we can see here

1137
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,040
on the right, instead of all species in

1138
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,119
the wilderness partition, we see that

1139
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,599
the wilderness train model here on the

1140
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,520
far right does actually outperform the

1141
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,680
highly modified model, but only for

1142
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,880
observations from wilderness regions for

1143
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,400
these wilderness associated species.

1144
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,920
What this suggests is that the growth

1145
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,920
form or the environment of these

1146
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,599
wilderness associated species is highly

1147
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
unique and that the model is leveraging

1148
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,440
them to make accurate predictions and

1149
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,200
really highlights the need that we need

1150
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,200
more data in these underststudied

1151
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
regions.

1152
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,640
Switching gears, we're going to now talk

1153
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,240
about space uh temporal bias,

1154
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,760
specifically the bias introduced from

1155
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,440
the city nature challenge, which happens

1156
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,960
every year during the last weekend in

1157
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,480
April. Um, which introduces this large

1158
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,480
spike in observations from observers.

1159
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,720
Volunteers during this week are

1160
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,640
encouraged to maximize the number of

1161
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,960
observations and also the unique species

1162
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,880
that they collect within this week. So

1163
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,320
again, if we plot out the label uh the

1164
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,800
the data for each of these two

1165
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,160
partitions for observations taken during

1166
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,839
the city nature challenge versus

1167
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,079
observations taken from the rest of the

1168
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,680
year, we see that while the majority of

1169
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,200
photos on our natural list are taken

1170
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,000
from outside of the city nature

1171
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,920
challenge, a sign uh a significantly

1172
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,040
higher number of species are are

1173
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,040
observed during this time as we can see

1174
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,320
again. So more than half of the species

1175
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,000
from the rest of the year are observed

1176
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,520
in just this one week.

1177
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,520
So for this partition, what we

1178
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,359
hypothesize is that these observations

1179
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,520
from the city nature challenge may be of

1180
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,359
higher quality due to the changes in

1181
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,880
user behaviors. Users are really focused

1182
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,640
on collecting as many observations as

1183
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,920
they can. Hopefully those observations

1184
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,599
would be of higher quality if they're

1185
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,760
really focusing on using the app within

1186
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,680
this week. So for this partition again,

1187
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,200
we compare observations from the city of

1188
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,359
nature challenge to the rest of the

1189
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,880
year.

1190
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,400
However, against our expectations, what

1191
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,560
we see is that the model trained on city

1192
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,560
nature observations actually shows an

1193
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,720
uniformly worse in domain and out of

1194
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,079
domain performance than model trained on

1195
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,640
the model trained on observations from

1196
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,599
the rest of the year. And interestingly

1197
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,800
enough, the model trained on

1198
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,440
observations of the rest of the year

1199
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,720
also classifies images from the city

1200
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,240
nature challenge better than the model

1201
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,160
trained on proper city nature challenge

1202
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,079
images as we can see here in the left

1203
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,680
side histogram.

1204
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,520
And in fact, if we break this accuracy

1205
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,760
down by day, we can indeed see that the

1206
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,359
city nature train model in purple is

1207
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,359
overfitted. It has a significantly

1208
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,960
higher accuracy during the days for

1209
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,880
observations from the days of the city

1210
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,359
nature challenge, but then shows a

1211
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,119
strong decrease in accuracy that is also

1212
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,280
scaled with the number of species seen

1213
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,560
in a given day,

1214
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,800
implying that the model has actually

1215
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,520
overfit to observations from the city

1216
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
nature challenge.

1217
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,160
Conversely, the model trained on

1218
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,079
observations from the rest of the year

1219
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,000
has a significantly higher and

1220
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,520
consistent accuracy no matter how many

1221
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,200
species were observed in a given day.

1222
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,720
This suggests that user behavior is in

1223
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,480
fact altered during the city nature

1224
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,640
challenge, but is not necessarily

1225
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,480
altered in good ways and in fact in ways

1226
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,000
that allows the model to cheat on

1227
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,520
observations for those um uh uh during

1228
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,760
that week at the detriment of

1229
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,760
generalizability.

1230
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,880
So for the last axis of bias that we're

1231
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,800
going to look at is the observation

1232
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,400
quality bias where most of the volunteer

1233
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,839
collect and biodiversity data that we're

1234
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,319
working with tends to come from a small

1235
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,760
group of high interest users. So if we

1236
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,680
actually break down the diff shift knock

1237
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,440
data set by naturalist user. So each of

1238
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,079
these yellow dots is a user from our

1239
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
from um from I naturalist we start to

1240
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,720
see two different user behavior patterns

1241
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,960
emerge. We see in yellow our equin

1242
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,720
infrequent observers tend to obser

1243
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,800
observe only one observation per species

1244
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,640
and then move on to the next species

1245
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,880
whereas frequent users highlighted in

1246
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,640
blue here on the very end. These users

1247
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,640
tend to observe species more than once

1248
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,880
and they tend to end oftentimes in

1249
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,720
diverse habitats.

1250
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,400
Noting these two different patterns um

1251
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,720
of user behavior, we then partition the

1252
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,960
div shift knock data set into two

1253
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,040
categories by observer engagement

1254
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,839
specifically into casual users in yellow

1255
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,280
versus engaged users in blue.

1256
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,760
What's interesting here is that there

1257
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,800
are only 521 engaged users which is

1258
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,040
again this blue p partition here. But

1259
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,880
these 521 users have collected over

1260
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,440
three times the amount of data that the

1261
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,560
75,000 users in the casual category have

1262
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,400
collected. really um which really goes

1263
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,119
to to highlight the the the

1264
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,280
long-tailedness as well in the user um

1265
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,040
engagement um side of our data as well.

1266
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,880
So if we compare the out of distribution

1267
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,960
test set performance for models trained

1268
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,400
across these two partitions and then we

1269
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,480
bend them by the number of observations

1270
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,319
per user, we see that models trained

1271
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,079
with engaged observations and tested on

1272
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,240
casual observations have a significant

1273
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,000
and sustained outofdistribution test set

1274
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,160
performance on obser on observations

1275
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,599
from casual observers.

1276
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,040
Interestingly enough for this engaged

1277
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,040
train model we see a strong negative

1278
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,760
relationship between the number of

1279
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,079
observations a user has taken and the

1280
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,839
engaged model performance. This suggests

1281
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,359
that the I naturalist observers who use

1282
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,920
the app least frequently. So the

1283
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,920
observers down here

1284
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,599
um tend to generate the most easy to

1285
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,599
identify data and the most generic kinds

1286
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,000
of observations focusing likely on the

1287
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,960
most common species that the model has a

1288
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,960
very easy time to identify.

1289
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,200
Um alternately if we uh look at the

1290
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,880
model trained on click

1291
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,800
here we go. If we look at a model

1292
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,560
trained on casual observations, then

1293
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,839
tested on observations from engaged

1294
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,760
users, we see that there's a a strong

1295
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,839
positive relationship. The click is

1296
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,839
still not working. Here we go. Come on.

1297
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,040
So even though casual train the casual

1298
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,800
train models performance is worse, we

1299
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,960
see that the more photos that a user

1300
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,960
takes, the higher the accuracy. This

1301
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,040
suggests that the most engaged users on

1302
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,280
the I Naturalist app take the best

1303
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,720
photos for species identification. These

1304
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,720
users know what features and what

1305
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,640
phenotypes to focus on when identifying

1306
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,480
species in the field to make those

1307
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,319
individuals more easily identifiable

1308
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,920
later on from images alone.

1309
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:01,760
So ultimately these findings imply that

1310
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,599
from spatial bias volunteer collected

1311
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,359
data is simply insufficient for us to

1312
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,599
use these models for the wildest places

1313
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,720
on Earth. From temporal bias that we

1314
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,319
really should use more than just

1315
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,680
bioblitz data and that there's some

1316
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,079
challenges with the way data is

1317
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,599
collected during these events. For

1318
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,280
taxonomic bias, which I didn't have time

1319
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,720
to get into today, we see that the

1320
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,319
commonness of rarity means that the

1321
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,160
modeling choices that we want to make

1322
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,000
when we're training models really

1323
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,079
depends on the downstream use cases of

1324
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,119
the of the actual products we build on

1325
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,880
top of them. For observer bias, when

1326
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,560
possible, we want to consider discarding

1327
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,359
data from those most infrequent users

1328
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,040
and focus on power users when possible.

1329
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,160
And lastly, for sociopolitical bias,

1330
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,240
which I also didn't have time to get

1331
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,920
into, we see that sparse data confounds

1332
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,920
performance degradation by distance. And

1333
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,000
so when possible, it's best to use

1334
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,560
expert curated validation data in low

1335
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,480
density areas to assure ensure that our

1336
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,079
models are making accurate predictions.

1337
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,720
So to summarize, one of the biggest

1338
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,000
challenges that still faces biodiversity

1339
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,760
foundation modeling is bias and

1340
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,560
biodiversity data. And so now we've seen

1341
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,480
that this bias driven this bias driven

1342
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,920
distribution shift does indeed affect

1343
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,200
biodiversity foundation model

1344
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,800
performance, but in unexpected ways. So

1345
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,400
in the face of these challenges and but

1346
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,160
also these opportunities where do we go

1347
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,599
from here?

1348
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,200
So looking forward towards building

1349
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,119
biodiversity foundation models that can

1350
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,040
have real world sustainability impact in

1351
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,640
the biodiversity monitoring space. We

1352
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,359
need to engineer models with three key

1353
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,200
traits including

1354
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,760
centering ecology and ecological

1355
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,000
principles. when building these models.

1356
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,240
Two, a global focus with an eye towards

1357
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,319
accuracy in the global south. And three,

1358
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,000
making sure these m models are safe and

1359
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,520
reliable enough for deployment and high

1360
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,280
stakes real world decision-making

1361
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,800
scenarios.

1362
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,160
With these three key traits in mind,

1363
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,400
there are still some significant gaps

1364
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,920
remaining towards building these reli uh

1365
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,119
biodiversity foundation models that are

1366
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,400
reliable enough for automated

1367
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,839
biodiversity monitoring tasks.

1368
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,400
If we return to the foundation model

1369
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,319
paradigm and the encology setting, we've

1370
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,000
seen that there are even more rich data

1371
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,359
modalities for us to pull from than what

1372
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,200
have traditionally been used in the in

1373
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,200
the foundation model setting. We have

1374
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,000
things such as camera trap imageries,

1375
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,319
bio acoustic satellite data, genetic

1376
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,319
data, etc. However, these data

1377
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,560
modalities are sparse and heterogeneous

1378
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,920
across space and time. Therefore, for us

1379
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,599
to further center ecology and

1380
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,359
biodiversity foundation models, we

1381
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,160
really need to focus on building better

1382
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,960
pre-training strategies as this part of

1383
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,119
the foundation model pipeline.

1384
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,119
Alternately, the idea of one model to

1385
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,119
rule them all across so many modalities

1386
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,440
and so many biological scales may not

1387
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,200
necessarily be feasible or even

1388
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,119
ecologically correct. And so, we may

1389
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,800
need different pre-training strategies

1390
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,960
in different foundation models depending

1391
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,200
on our different downstream monitoring

1392
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,800
tasks.

1393
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,240
Additionally, we should also focus on

1394
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,079
better alignment strategies when

1395
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,520
thinking when all modalities are not

1396
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,000
necessarily universally present,

1397
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,160
including recent work like Taxabine in

1398
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,640
order for us to align modalities when

1399
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,920
data gaps exists and but nevertheless

1400
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,680
utilize data at scale.

1401
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,079
Lastly, for the integration step, we

1402
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,000
want to incorporate a global focus. And

1403
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,119
so we really need to think about the

1404
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,200
fine-tuning strategies and other um

1405
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,599
fine-tuning strategies and especially

1406
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,079
validation that centers performance on a

1407
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,680
global scale and emphasizes accuracy in

1408
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:22,160
the species rich tropics

1409
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,920
and and including a critical eye towards

1410
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,440
when and when not to use these sorts of

1411
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,280
approaches depending on the different

1412
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,160
biases etc that are present in this

1413
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,599
data. So taken together, these

1414
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,280
directions will help us to build better

1415
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,440
biodiversity foundation models that

1416
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,920
better represent and ultimately protect

1417
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,440
the natural world and with the goal of

1418
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,680
helping us to see and track the forest

1419
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,520
for the trees. So with that, I'd like to

1420
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,200
thank you all for listening and I as

1421
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,880
Elena mentions, I'm starting a new lab

1422
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,160
here u next year at University of

1423
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,839
Michigan and so I'm in the process of

1424
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,359
recruiting PhD students. If any of this

1425
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:56,440
work seems interesting to you, please

1426
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,440
feel free to reach out. That's all.
