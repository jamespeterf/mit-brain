00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,359
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,359
MPG primer. We have Raymond Walters

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,559
talking about heritability of common

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,719
complex traits. Uh he is an instructor

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,000
in investigation in the analytic and

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,760
translational genetics unit at MGH and a

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,119
group leader in the Stanley Center for

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,119
Psychiatric Research here at the Broad

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,840
Institute. He joined the Broad in 2014

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,359
as a postoc with Dr. Benjamin Neil after

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,560
completing his PhD in quantitative

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,040
psychology at the University of Notre

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Dame. Dr. Walters has extensive

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,399
experience in large-scale analysis of

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,200
human genomic data sets including as a

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,120
lead analyst in the psychiatric genomics

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,360
consortium and multiple projects

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,960
investigating patterns of heritability,

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,640
missingness and late infecture

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,120
structures across the UK bio bank. Um,

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,199
thank you Raymond.

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,399
Thank you. Um good morning everyone. Uh

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,840
going to dive in this morning to the fun

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,520
topic of heritability. Uh mostly in the

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,000
context of uh complex common complex

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,840
traits the oh at least the initial

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,040
things we talk about generalized to kind

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,040
of all traits. Um but gonna spend the

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
time this morning kind of starting from

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,159
just kind of as a theoretical concept

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
what do we mean by heritability and then

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,040
spend a fair amount of time talking

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,320
about how we actually go about

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,680
estimating that quantity um and some

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,840
results of what that looks like in

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,159
practice. um and then a little bit of

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,799
time at the end to kind of further

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,159
motivate like even if this quantity I

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
introduce of heritability isn't

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
necessarily of interest to you itself

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,880
the ways in which it informs kind of

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,560
other directions within genetics

43
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,200
research. Uh so kicking off the the top

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,799
on just what do we mean by heritability

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,439
kind of the the very old and kind of

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,000
very qualitative observation is simply

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,759
that children resemble their parents.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,479
This kind of continues over generations

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,960
within families. So some idea of there

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,200
being inheritance of traits and so that

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,200
trait is heritable. You can inherit it

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,640
from your

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,239
parents. and kind of early statements

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,480
about thinking about this as a more

55
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,640
quantitative idea go back to kind of

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,200
like the earliest concepts of regression

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,120
and work by Golton and others kind of

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
just making the statement more formal

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,480
that for example if you look at the

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
height of a child relative to the

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,519
average height of their parents that you

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
do see a relationship there in this kind

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,760
of regression style and then thinking

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,280
about what that means for how much of

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,000
that trait is inherited versus coming

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
from other sources.

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,360
And so to kind of formalize that into a

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,519
mathematical quantity, at least in some

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,760
intuitive sense, we can think about any

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,959
given human phenotype as being some

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,080
combination of a genetics piece and an

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,160
environmental piece. Uh and then the

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,800
heritability from that simple model is

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,200
simply saying how much of that overall

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
variation in the phenotype comes from

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,440
that genetic piece as opposed to that

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,840
environmental piece. So kind of

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,560
splitting up that pie chart of the kind

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,560
of total variability in that observed

80
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,680
trait. Um and that very simple

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
conception that everything else we'll

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,680
talk about rests on makes a lot of kind

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,319
of simple intuitive sense until we have

84
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,560
to start dealing with a lot of kind of

85
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,200
the mathematical things that pop up out

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
of this being an

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,360
oversimplification. And so to maintain

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,879
that definition of heritability, we have

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,239
to make decisions about what do we do if

90
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,000
that genetics risk for the phenotype and

91
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,640
the environmental risk for a phenotype

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
are correlated or if they interact. And

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,400
so we could choose to take this in a

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,400
direction of that genetics piece being

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
just some sort of causal definition of

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
the genetics

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,360
um and thinking about some kind of true

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,040
underlying causal effect sizes there. Or

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,599
we could think about this in terms of

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,920
the maximal variance explained by a

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,120
genetic risk

102
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,599
prediction. Um, and essentially the

103
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,280
environment then becomes the residual

104
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,079
the for what could be explained by the

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,120
genetics regardless of kind of the

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,199
underlying causal mechanisms there. And

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199
we'll we'll see that pop up as we get

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,520
into actual methods for trying to

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,120
estimate this quantity.

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,600
The the other thing that emerges just

111
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,120
from looking at this definition is that

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,320
these are quantities that aren't

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,440
necessarily stable across time and place

114
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,360
or even how you measure a given

115
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,240
phenotype. Uh in that if the environment

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,160
changes if suddenly there is like an

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,639
increase in the variability of

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,479
environmental risks towards a phenotype

119
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,199
that'll shift the heritability because

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,080
now as a proportion of that total

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,639
variability the genetic contribution has

122
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,199
shrunk. Similarly, if as population

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,199
demographics shift over time or you look

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
in a different population, the

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,080
variability of that genetic component

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,600
may differ due to drift and al

127
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,440
frequencies, selection, assorted mating,

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,759
all these kind of population genetics

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
forces that will also change that

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,120
heritability. And so what we have is a

131
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,280
like parameter that describes a fraction

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,840
of a trait that might be attributable in

133
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,240
some way to genetics, but that is very

134
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,400
much going to be attached to a given

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
population at a given time and place.

136
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
And so uh while it's easy to fall into

137
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,199
the idea of thinking about like there

138
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
being a heritability of your favorite

139
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,600
trait, so like the heritability of

140
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,759
height is 80% or something like that,

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,440
that is very much a contextual statement

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,160
rather than some fixed statement about

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
the trait.

144
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,000
Um the another thing we'll run into with

145
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,919
this definition is and you may already

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,680
be catching on to if you've seen

147
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,639
discussion of heritability before. I've

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,360
written this with a capital H. Uh but

149
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
most of the times you'll see

150
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,880
heritability kind of the notation with a

151
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,360
lowercase H. This reflects that we have

152
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,840
to make a decision um about what all is

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
captured in the types of genetics we're

154
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,000
going to include in that numerator of

155
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:23,680
this fraction. And as especially in the

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Goss era but even before that um often

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,000
we talk about heritability in a slightly

158
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,919
narrower sense than what is this broad

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,960
sense

160
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,440
heritability and so in particular

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,440
there's kind of a range here starting

162
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,360
from that broadest sense where when we

163
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,440
say we're going to say genetics means

164
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,960
all of genetics but we can quickly kind

165
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,319
of subset that to well all of genetics

166
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,080
is computationally hard and there's some

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,759
benefits to simplifying it too. We'll

168
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,440
just talk about additive effects of

169
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,600
genetics because that's easier to

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,479
estimate. And so that's that's what that

171
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,479
the lowercase H square comes from is

172
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,199
that narrower sense of just the additive

173
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,960
contribution of

174
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,199
genetics.

175
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,440
Um getting below that and is as we've

176
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
gotten to being able to do genetics

177
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
directly off of measured genetics as

178
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
opposed to inferring it from things like

179
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
family structure.

180
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,360
uh we can think about the the genetic

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,039
contribution that is coming just from

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,440
common varants and uh or or common snips

183
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,880
and so the kind of standard notation

184
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
that's emerged in the field for that is

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,759
this H square subg

186
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,720
um just to note that kind of common

187
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,240
genetic piece and so leaving aside that

188
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,919
like we're going to get to estimation

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,080
methods that are using GWS data and so

190
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,919
don't capture necessarily CMVs maybe

191
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,319
aren't capturing the contribution of

192
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,039
rare variants or especially denovo vari

193
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,479
variants which are kind of in this weird

194
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
space of like they're a genetic

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,440
component but they're not inherited so

196
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,000
do we want them in the definition anyway

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,000
um so that kind of shift and then if you

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,919
go back

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,520
to some of the early days of G-W was

200
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,360
there was also some discussion of these

201
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,680
later two uh quantities thinking of kind

202
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,520
of the variance explained by a PRS or

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,400
the variance explained by top

204
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,400
significant lossi energy was as kind of

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,160
a heritability like quantity

206
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,919
in the sense that they very directly are

207
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,360
this kind of ratio of like what's

208
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,199
explained by that more directly measured

209
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,680
observable genetics relative to the

210
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,680
phenotype but now less a theoretical

211
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,440
quantity about kind of overall

212
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
contribution of genetics and more a

213
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,599
directly observed quantity off of some

214
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
specific attempt at measuring genetic

215
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,120
risk via PRS or from uh some individual

216
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
let's say and so I I ordered them this

217
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
way in part because there is a strict

218
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,440
ordering of these quantities and so the

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,440
heritability will range between zero and

220
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,200
one because it's a fraction of that

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,959
total variability. But the narrow sense

222
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
heritability has to be less than or

223
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,680
equal to the broad sense heritability in

224
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,120
that either all the effects are additive

225
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,560
or there are some additive effects and

226
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
then there's some fraction beyond that

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,959
from dominance effects or other such

228
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
things um that would make the broad

229
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,080
sense be larger than the narrow sense

230
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,080
and that kind of continues them this

231
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,200
chain. Um, so those are all different

232
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
versions of how to define the

233
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,680
heritability. There's another problem

234
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,920
that arises for many of the traits we

235
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,160
care about in that this kind of idea of

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,880
separating the variance into a genetic

237
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,200
piece and a non- genetic piece doesn't

238
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,440
immediately translate to the variance of

239
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
a binary phenotype just because a binary

240
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
phenotypes variance is a function of its

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,360
mean and doesn't have this natural

242
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,839
partitioning in some like additive

243
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,040
linear model kind of sense.

244
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,160
And so the classic solution has been to

245
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,440
imagine uh as kind of already exists for

246
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,920
things like logistic or probit

247
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,600
regression that there's some underlying

248
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,320
continuum of risk that is a continuous

249
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,560
value that we refer to as the liability

250
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,920
for that phenotype. Um and then we can

251
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,399
talk about the heritability of that

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,800
continuous liability as reflecting the

253
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,800
heritability that we care about. Um

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,360
rather than the heritability defined

255
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:16,519
directly off of the

256
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,399
uh directly off of the the observed

257
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,839
phenotype. Um and so kind of graphically

258
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,920
the the idea here is um uh starting in

259
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,800
that top panel. So if we have the

260
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,160
combination of a distribution that is

261
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,560
the environmental effect and the

262
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,640
distribution that is the genetic effect.

263
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,279
I'll just get the cursor so I can

264
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,760
actually gesture this. Perfect. So an

265
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,680
environmental piece and a genetic piece

266
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
that combine into some population

267
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,200
distribution that is continuous like

268
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,720
this. And the thing that matters to the

269
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
phenotype is the combination of them

270
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,839
here. And so, oh, if we had a continuous

271
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,480
phenotype, this might be directly the

272
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,839
observed phenotype. But for um a binary

273
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,560
phenotype, we'll imagine that this is

274
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,959
some unobserved underlying liability.

275
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,800
And then so for that binary phenotype

276
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,640
where the statement is that that same

277
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,360
kind of combination of environmental and

278
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,440
genetic risk combining into uh kind of

279
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,120
the observed phenotype, it still exists.

280
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,360
But now what we observe instead of that

281
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,440
smooth continuation is simply the

282
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,240
distinction between uh these points in

283
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,560
black and these points in red based on

284
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,519
uh cases being above some threshold in

285
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,120
that continuum. And so that kind of

286
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,160
mathematical slide of hand solves our

287
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,839
question about how to define

288
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,959
heritability uh for a binary trait. Um

289
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,480
the other way you can think about this

290
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,399
if you prefer the kind of equation

291
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,600
statement is that we do the swap to that

292
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,680
uh the phenotype that is genetics type

293
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,440
plus environment is uh the liability and

294
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
what we observe is a function of that

295
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
liability being above above or below

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
that

297
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,720
threshold.

298
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,399
Um, so putting all those pieces together

299
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
and trying to summarize like what is

300
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,120
what are you talking about with

301
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,120
heritability that we're focused on that

302
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,600
idea of a proportion of variation in a

303
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,959
trait that comes from or is explained by

304
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,600
genetics. This is again a population

305
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,959
parameter in that you know can shift

306
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,880
based on how we measure the phenotype

307
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,160
and who we measured it in and the forces

308
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,320
happening in that population. Um, and

309
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,200
kind of depending on our decisions about

310
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,600
how exactly to define that genetic piece

311
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,639
versus that environment piece, it might

312
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,120
make sense to think about this as like a

313
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,959
causal proportion of the the phenotype.

314
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
But it may also make more sense to just

315
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,959
think about it as the most you could

316
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,600
explain by the best possible genetics

317
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,480
predictor, possibly subsetting to say

318
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,399
common variance or, you know, observed

319
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,880
variance in some way. that is kind of

320
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:55,000
the population level observed underlying

321
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,680
like best possible prediction

322
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,880
level. Uh what that means for what it is

323
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,440
not is that it's not a statement about

324
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,760
how mutable the phenotype would be over

325
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,440
possible interventions or amount of

326
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,079
variability that could exist in uh

327
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,120
shifts in the environment.

328
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,040
Um, this was there's a lot of good

329
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,399
literature trying to hash out kind of

330
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,519
the theoretical statements of this,

331
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,120
especially out of the sociology

332
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,320
literature and especially around debates

333
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,160
over the heritability of things like

334
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,040
intelligence. Um, and perhaps the the

335
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,959
cleanest summary I've uh heard goes back

336
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,440
to this favorite from Goldberger who

337
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,160
remarks that we could find that the the

338
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,720
heritability of say eyes height maybe

339
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,880
approaches 100%. practice it probably

340
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
doesn't. But for sake of argument, we

341
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,639
could say it does. But that wouldn't

342
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
mean that we necessarily need to give up

343
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,720
on the idea of making glasses for

344
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,639
people. Like we, you know, just because

345
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
a biological phenomena has some

346
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
contribution of genetics and some

347
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
variability in the population doesn't

348
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,320
really speak to the opportunity to

349
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,399
intervene on it. It's simply a measure

350
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
of the variability as it exists at the

351
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,560
moment. The other thing is because it's

352
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
a population parameter, it doesn't tell

353
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,959
you anything really about the difference

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,959
between populations. Like you other than

355
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,600
that you could say that the heritability

356
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,440
in some population for a phenotype is

357
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
higher or lower than in a different

358
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
population for that same phenotype. That

359
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,519
doesn't tell you about whether observed

360
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,760
phenotypic differences between those

361
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
populations are due to genetics or not

362
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
because it's a within population

363
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,199
parameter rather than a between

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,199
population parameter.

365
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,000
Um so all those are statements about

366
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,880
kind of heritability as a theoretical

367
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,079
quantity. Um and now we can get into in

368
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,240
practice how do we actually go about

369
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:48,240
trying to estimate this

370
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,839
quantity. Um and that estimation

371
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,519
historically started in the same place

372
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,600
the observation about what we even mean

373
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,680
by this concept of variability did which

374
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,279
is with that resemblance within

375
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,600
families. Um and so in particular the

376
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,279
kind of quantitative way to get there so

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,880
keeping our same model that we're

378
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,839
talking about the phenotype that has

379
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,040
genetics and environment in it. If we

380
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,519
have a pair of people the similarity in

381
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,600
their phenotype should reflect the

382
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,920
combination of how similar their genetic

383
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,000
risk for that phenotype is and how

384
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,800
similar their environmental contribution

385
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,320
to that phenotype is. mathematical

386
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,160
arrangement gives you that the

387
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,079
heritability lives as coefficients on

388
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,320
kind of those pieces and assembling a

389
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,519
total

390
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,800
correlation. And for related pairs of

391
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,480
individuals, we don't actually need to

392
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,959
observe their genetics directly to know

393
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,000
at least in expectation how similar

394
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,079
their genetics are simply as a by virtue

395
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,759
of their relatedness.

396
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,079
This is a slightly easier statement to

397
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,720
make for like common complex traits

398
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,519
where we expect that the kind of overall

399
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,759
relatedness for a pair of individuals

400
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
should fairly directly translate to how

401
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,519
similar they are on the genetic

402
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,680
component for any given phenotype just

403
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,759
because polygenist exists. Um it gets uh

404
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,720
the the level of certainty of there gets

405
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,360
much less certain once you're talking

406
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,440
um uh mandelian phenotypes where like

407
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,320
the the level of expectation is the same

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,959
but the amount of variability and uh

409
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,959
between uh individuals with the same

410
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,240
level of relatedness

411
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,959
uh um how often they'll have that kind

412
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,560
of same amount of sharing will be yeah

413
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,199
assumption here is just that this is all

414
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,600
multivaried Gaussian right that goes

415
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,880
into this. So this is just like a large

416
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,120
locus large number of locus assumption.

417
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Yeah, that same way works better in

418
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
complex traits. That's the assumption.

419
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,279
Yeah, that one it's a large number of

420
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,920
lowi that kind of central limit theorem

421
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,519
kind of mini loi contribution gets you

422
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,120
there. You don't have to make that

423
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,959
assumption because even in mandelian

424
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,120
inheritance in expectation that

425
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,959
correlation works out the same. It's

426
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
just that you don't have the kind of

427
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,919
nice law large numbers kind of behavior

428
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,919
for getting

429
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,919
there.

430
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:18,000
Cool. Uh so with that kind of intuition,

431
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,000
the kind of canonical example of how

432
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,760
this has been gone about is thinking

433
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,199
about

434
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,919
this within families or especially

435
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,720
within twins. And so the idea here is

436
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,720
that kind of schematically

437
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,320
um if you think about pairs of

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
individuals based on the nature of their

439
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,400
relationship is kind of drawn out along

440
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,799
the the x-axis of this this diagram here

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,520
kind of the more related you are

442
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,200
especially for for twin pairs. If a

443
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,280
trait is heritable, you should see that

444
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,160
that phenotype is more similar between

445
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,559
those pairs of individuals versus if a

446
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,919
phenotype isn't heritable, then kind of

447
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,919
regardless of how similar the

448
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,280
individuals are genetically, the traits

449
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,520
only being driven by environmental

450
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,320
features. And so, oh, you'll just have

451
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,840
some kind of average background of uh

452
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,760
similarity in phenotype that's

453
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,360
essentially null.

454
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,520
And so you could do this with the full

455
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,280
spectrum of relatedness, but turns out

456
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,760
you can get there fairly easily just

457
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,039
with twin pairs uh that are either

458
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,160
identical twins or uh fraternal or

459
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,440
dygotic twins. And so I won't belabor

460
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
stepping through all the math, but

461
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,880
essentially the idea here is is that the

462
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,960
identical twins will share all of their

463
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,679
genetics. The dygotic twins will share

464
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,919
half of their genetics on average um as

465
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,840
any siblings

466
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:38,080
would. We'll make an assumption that the

467
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,480
similarity in the environment between a

468
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,919
pair of twins is the same regardless of

469
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,480
whether they're identical twins or

470
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,840
they're zygotic twins. It's a rather

471
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
questionable assumption but is the

472
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,200
common assumption that gets us to the

473
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,720
easiest estimator. And so in that

474
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,760
scenario, the heritability emerges as

475
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,280
simply the difference uh as a function

476
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
of the difference in the correlation

477
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,360
between pairs of twins that are

478
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,440
monozygotic versus ones that are

479
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,799
digygotic. Um because you have that

480
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,960
difference and how genetically similar

481
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,039
they are, we can subtract out away that

482
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,679
kind of equivalent environmental piece

483
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,320
and get to just an estimate of the

484
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:21,039
heritability. And so kind of as an old

485
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,160
so simple version of getting there um

486
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,039
you get an estimate like

487
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,320
this. Um you know there's much room to

488
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,000
generalize upon that model and get more

489
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,520
sophisticated. Um so often this will get

490
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,880
represented in terms of something like

491
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,039
the the ACE model where we now have an

492
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,760
additive genetic component, a dominance

493
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,480
genetic component, a shared common

494
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,000
environment piece and a unique

495
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,480
environment or residual error term for

496
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,320
each individual phenotype and we can set

497
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,000
expectations about how correlated

498
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,960
between the individuals each of those

499
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,160
species should be. So the the dominance

500
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,000
piece will behave different than an

501
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,600
additive piece. which room to allow

502
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,039
variability on what that shared

503
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
environment looks like, especially as

504
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,280
you incorporate dzygotic twins versus

505
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,880
other forms of siblings versus cousins.

506
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,160
You can extend this with individuals

507
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,640
from those other forms of relatedness.

508
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,720
Um, and they, you know, essentially get

509
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,120
to more sophisticated estimation off

510
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,679
that same basic uh familial form of

511
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,679
thinking about

512
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,480
heritability. All that is done without

513
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,720
observing the genetic data though. And

514
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,720
so we now have many methods that work

515
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,120
with data that we can observe genotype

516
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,039
and attack this question of how much

517
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,720
genetic contribution to phenotype there

518
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,720
is in other ways. This list isn't

519
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,480
exhaustive but but is intended to just

520
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,360
give you a flavor of is kind of the

521
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,320
diversity of methods that that exist.

522
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,320
There's a wide range. Um, and so for for

523
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,720
today, I'm going to talk mostly just

524
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,520
about to these two that are probably the

525
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,000
the most common in circulation and kind

526
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,799
of provide a good reference point for

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,559
many of the other methods here. Um, but

528
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,480
what I'm talking about by no means is

529
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919
exhaustive for the different ways that

530
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
have been proposed for estimating

531
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,120
heritability.

532
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,360
Um so starting with this method called

533
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,039
greml um which comes from it's a

534
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,760
restricted maximum likelihood estimate

535
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,919
using genetic relatedness. And so it

536
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,640
emerges from ex that exact same idea

537
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,320
that existed for our twin or family

538
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,240
based estimation that more related

539
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,159
individuals will be more phenotypically

540
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,480
similar proportional to how heritable

541
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,760
the phenotype is. but says instead of

542
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,240
working at the extreme of um like

543
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,039
perfectly related twins, can we do that

544
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,840
with nominally unrelated individuals

545
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,840
based on the kind of much more subtle

546
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,840
variation in people who are slightly

547
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,000
more genetically similar than average or

548
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,640
slightly less genetically similar than

549
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,720
average. Um, and when you play that idea

550
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,520
out, the the model that you kind of get

551
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,000
to is that you essentially say that the

552
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,600
that variation across individuals in the

553
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,520
phenotype. Um, and the similarity or

554
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,640
dissimilarity between those individuals

555
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,600
is a function of kind of a residual

556
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,240
error term that is I that is independent

557
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
across those unrelated individuals. And

558
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,320
then this genetic component that is

559
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,480
proportional to the gen observed genetic

560
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,559
relatedness between those people based

561
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,679
on a genetic relatedness matrix

562
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:33,039
estimated from you know estimates of IBD

563
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,159
and genetic sharing. And so

564
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,840
um while what the the literal estimation

565
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
of that VA maximum likelihood isn't

566
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,760
quite the regression shown here,

567
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,039
conceptually they end up in a very

568
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,520
similar place and that you have this

569
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,520
kind of narrow range of very small

570
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,000
genetic related assessments that are

571
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,480
slightly above or below zero and a

572
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,360
relationship to that for any given pair

573
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,280
of individuals to kind of how similar or

574
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,280
dissimilar their phenotype are on some

575
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,120
standardized scale. And the very very

576
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,520
subtle slope that does exist in that

577
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,000
line prod would give you an estimate of

578
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,600
heritability and conceptually that is

579
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
approximately what you're getting out of

580
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,919
the actual way that GCDA does this in a

581
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,840
maximum likelihood sense for fitting

582
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,159
that

583
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,760
model. And so, oh, kind of the key here

584
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
is as long as with your observed

585
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,159
genetics, you can make that estimate of

586
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,000
how genetically similar people are and

587
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
kind cross your fingers in the same way

588
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
we already discussed that you know,

589
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,159
especially for things that are polygenic

590
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,320
on average that you know observed amount

591
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
of little bit of higher or lower genetic

592
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,720
relatedness will track with the

593
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,400
phenotype because somewhere in that

594
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,480
estimate of the genetic relatedness is

595
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,799
the relatedness on the pieces of the

596
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,080
genetics that actually inform the trait.

597
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,760
Um and so this gives you um an estimate

598
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,760
off of that observed genetics of the

599
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
heritability.

600
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,039
Yeah. On the left that sorry

601
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,640
sorry on the left that that's the

602
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,480
variance coariance matrix in the

603
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,840
phenotypes or the uh in the equation.

604
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,520
Yeah the and the i that's is that's not

605
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,440
the identity matrix or it is the

606
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,440
identity matrix or just matrix of ones.

607
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:19,840
Uh it is the identity matrix.

608
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,200
So it's it's it's it turns into a

609
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,720
slightly weird statement. So the the

610
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,559
implied matrix on the left hand side is

611
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,039
n byn. So individual by

612
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,559
individual. In practice, the kind of

613
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,039
sufficient statistic observation there

614
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,720
ends up being just the crossroduct of

615
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
the two phenotypes between the two

616
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,919
individuals with some standardization

617
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,480
for for scale.

618
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,559
And so yeah, then you have a term that's

619
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,120
on that matrix of correlation in

620
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,880
genetics and a term of what is meant to

621
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,640
be correlation in environmental terms

622
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,279
that we take to be the identity matrix

623
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,679
and say that their environments are

624
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:55,679
independent since they're

625
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,720
unrelated. Cool.

626
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,159
Uh uh the other method I want to spend

627
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,400
some time talking about is called LD

628
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,679
score regression which takes a slightly

629
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,520
different tactic uh particularly living

630
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,279
within our GWS era and asks um so we

631
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,200
have G-W wases looking at the amount of

632
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,360
association of all of our common genetic

633
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,000
variants with a given trait here the the

634
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,640
example of the 2014 paper on

635
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,200
schizophrenia and so instead of looking

636
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,080
directly from how related individuals

637
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,240
are. Can we take our observation of the

638
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,559
amount of association signal in a G-W

639
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,679
was and turn that into an estimate of

640
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,840
heritability partially for the benefits

641
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,919
of being able to do this hopefully off

642
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,919
of just the G-W was results without

643
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,240
needing to refer back to the individual

644
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,840
level genotypes in a way that allows us

645
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,600
to keep up with say metaanalyses

646
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,159
um and maybe some lower computational

647
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,279
overhead. And so the intuition that

648
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,559
turned into LV scorecore regression um

649
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,799
was that if we imagine our our genome

650
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,760
here at toy genome of with 20 little

651
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,919
snips on it um and we we know that the

652
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,039
genome has this structure in terms of

653
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,120
blocks of linkage to

654
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,720
sigilum. Um and we'll we'll lay down

655
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,080
some blocks of that on our little toy

656
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,600
example here. Um and we have some snips

657
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,080
that aren't in LD with any of those

658
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,880
blocks. We'll call them lonely snips.

659
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,480
They have no friends. Um, and for sake

660
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,559
of illustration, we'll say that the the

661
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,400
snips in the LD blocks are all perfectly

662
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,919
correlated with one another. No

663
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,159
variability in that R square, just

664
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,159
perfect LD

665
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,039
blocks. Um and so we asked the question

666
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,760
of so if this is our toy little genome

667
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,480
and if polygenicity exists and there's

668
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,880
some set of causal variants that kind of

669
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,360
exist at random across her miniature

670
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,279
genome what might we observe in GWS

671
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,240
association and so if we play that out

672
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,919
we can say that well we had you know

673
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,559
there's a couple causal snips we'll say

674
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,320
at random they fall in these two

675
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,640
locations and so for GW was what we'd

676
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,360
observe is that for each of those causal

677
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,120
snips, all of the snips in that LD block

678
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,400
would show association in the G-W was.

679
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,760
We can't really differentiate which is a

680
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
causal variant because they're all

681
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,320
perfectly correlated. And so each of

682
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,919
those blocks would be fully associated.

683
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,919
The things not in those blocks would not

684
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,880
be

685
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,480
associated. But we're doing this kind of

686
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,159
at random. So, you know, you know, maybe

687
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,279
in a a different reality it look like

688
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,799
this or maybe in a different

689
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,400
equivalently structured section of the

690
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,559
genome. You see causal snippets in these

691
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,679
locations. And so again, you'd see their

692
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,039
corresponding LD blocks show

693
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,520
association. You wouldn't see

694
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,120
association elsewhere. We play this out

695
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,559
as kind of a random process that

696
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,760
continues to happen. Every once in a

697
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,919
while, we do actually hit one of those

698
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,440
lonely snips. And so, oh, it doesn't

699
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,400
show association for a block. We see

700
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,559
association just for that snip. Hooray.

701
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,480
But if we, you know, thought about that

702
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,120
process kind of happening at random at

703
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,520
large scale, what we'd observe is that

704
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,760
the likelihood that a given snip shows

705
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,799
up as associated with our phenotype in a

706
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,880
G-W was sense, would be proportional to

707
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,960
the size of the LD block it lives in or

708
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,000
how much genetic variation it's tagging

709
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,880
kind of equivalently there. And so it

710
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,360
turns out that that

711
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,320
observation with some simplifying

712
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,720
assumptions lets you derive a

713
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,679
mathematical expectation that the the

714
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,520
result in the G-W was represented here

715
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,200
kind of in the expectation of its

716
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,600
kaiquare statistic for a given snip is a

717
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,559
function of

718
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,880
uh some pieces that have to do with

719
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,000
confounding or population

720
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,000
stratification. But then a piece that is

721
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,399
related to that concept we just laid out

722
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,880
which is how much variation does that

723
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,840
snip tag. So in practice taken as the

724
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,200
sum of correlation of that snip J with

725
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,279
all all surrounding snips. And it turns

726
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,240
out that when you walk through that kind

727
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,559
of expectation that you have a piece

728
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,720
that is constant with respect to snip

729
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,640
because it is more about overall

730
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,760
inflation that's not a spec in the G-W

731
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,360
was that isn't related to LD and then

732
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,039
something that we you know if we think

733
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,440
of this as a regression equation would

734
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,120
be the slope attached to that

735
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,440
information about LD and that slope

736
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,640
happens to be a function of

737
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,480
heritability.

738
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,880
and sample size and number of snips

739
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,279
which are known quantities. And so we

740
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,919
can do this regression, get a slope and

741
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,799
turn that back into an estimate of

742
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,799
sniper

743
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:40,480
heritability. Um, and since the only

744
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,159
inputs here are G-W was information and

745
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,840
information about LD, which we could

746
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,480
pull from some reference panel without

747
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,799
needing to go back into individual level

748
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,720
data. We can do this just from the

749
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,960
information that's in the G-W was. And

750
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,480
it turns out that we can get this

751
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,000
estimator because there is a link

752
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,480
between that amount of signal in a G-W

753
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,120
was and the kind of and that overall

754
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,120
heritability under some

755
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,679
expectations. Didn't get good at time.

756
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,480
All right. So that's at least kind of

757
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,880
the main ways in which heritability

758
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
estimation has happened in the field.

759
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,520
What do these different approaches tell

760
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,279
us about heritability in our complex

761
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,919
traits?

762
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,240
And so kind of especially out of the

763
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,720
long history we have now of twin twin

764
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,440
family studies the kind of broad

765
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,039
takeaway has been the statement that's

766
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,880
uh you know been been described as the

767
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,559
first law of behavior genetics that

768
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,880
could probably also apply to kind of

769
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,720
human genetics at large which is that at

770
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,919
least as a first approximation all

771
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,760
traits are heritable.

772
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,399
um was kind of the rule of thumb that

773
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,520
people expected and kind of reviews of

774
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,000
the literature have upheld that idea. So

775
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,720
this is a review done about 10 years ago

776
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,960
now looking across about 50 years worth

777
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
of twin studies and meta analyzing as

778
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,360
much as possible within traits that have

779
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
been studied over that time. um and

780
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,799
found that kind of broadly across

781
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,360
phenotypic domains in these different

782
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,320
clusters of parts here that you see kind

783
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,960
of this moderate heritability often you

784
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,399
know either side of 0.5

785
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,919
um in the it's in the purple bars here

786
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,840
versus there's uh some information on uh

787
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,679
the kind of shared environment estimates

788
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,679
in those green bars can so kind of yeah

789
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,240
I had a question um earlier you

790
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,720
mentioned heritability as a population

791
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,880
level parameter. Have people made

792
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,880
similar plots for this for other

793
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,679
populations or should we assume this is

794
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,679
the white European

795
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,640
um estimates we're looking at? Yeah,

796
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,320
it's a good question. So, this

797
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,919
is the estimates in here include

798
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,200
estimates from multiple populations

799
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,720
going into these averages, but the

800
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,559
preponderance of those studies and so

801
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,640
the prepoundonderance of the weight in

802
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,920
the these values are coming from kind of

803
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,159
white European predominant populations.

804
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,840
[Music]

805
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,880
Um

806
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,120
the values do tend to be similar um up

807
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,240
to variations that are more study

808
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,240
specific factors but there's not like

809
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,760
broad differences I would say in terms

810
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,320
of the takeaways for different like

811
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,320
ancestral

812
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,200
populations. Um yeah so in these

813
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,720
different phenotypic domains you see

814
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,399
maybe some variability where some of the

815
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,159
more you know anthropometric or more

816
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,080
directly measured kind of phenotypes or

817
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,039
maybe slightly higher inheritability and

818
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,159
slightly lower for you know personality

819
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,080
or social values kind of phenotypes but

820
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,960
by and large strong heritability and

821
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,159
basically every type of measure we care

822
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,640
about in people.

823
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,960
Um and the same broad statement probably

824
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,240
applies to our estimates off of the

825
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,320
genetic data. So here looking at methods

826
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,399
with that LD uh estimates from that LD

827
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,440
score regression method applied to G-W

828
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,360
was in thousands of traits in UK bioank.

829
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,080
Uh the particular results here are from

830
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,080
an effort we did in the lab. Um but this

831
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,399
has been kind of replicated in kind of

832
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,200
multiple publications of different

833
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,880
domains of phenotypes as well. And so

834
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
kind of broad strokes, you can see the

835
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,200
distribution there and the significance

836
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,279
on those values stratified by kind of

837
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,440
our level of certainty in those

838
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,440
phenotypes due to sample size and

839
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,919
measurement scales and things like that.

840
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,519
But kind of broad statement, the middle

841
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,760
of that distribution is solidly away

842
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,399
from zero with an average heritability

843
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,519
of around 0.1 in this form of

844
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,159
estimation. Looking at this is a sniper

845
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,000
heritability as opposed to a family

846
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
based heritability estimate. It's in

847
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,279
theory at least all of the narrow sense

848
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,039
heritability. Um but at least for all

849
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,640
the things that are well powered for G-W

850
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,120
was and subject to some kind of QC we

851
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,440
see that the preponderance of things

852
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,960
that are well powered show signs of

853
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,039
genetic signal that align with having at

854
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,360
least some heritability out of our G-W

855
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,200
was results. Um so at least uh kind of

856
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,200
qualitatively concordant with the the

857
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,839
idea that everything is heritable.

858
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,040
Um that difference though between that

859
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,800
0.1 that exists in like an LD square

860
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,159
regression or other efforts that have

861
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,280
been made to quantify the genetic signal

862
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,280
in G-W was versus the like 50%

863
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,599
heritability in a lot of the historic

864
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,960
twin family

865
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,240
studies did has did at least for a time

866
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,119
was the kind of crisis of faith of

867
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,919
thinking about why are these estimates

868
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,919
in G-W was estimates so much lower than

869
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,879
what we observed in twin family studies

870
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,399
the so-called missing inheritability

871
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,200
problem. Um, and part of that goes back

872
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,280
to kind of thinking more carefully about

873
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,200
the different quantities that are being

874
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,560
estimated. So that twin and family

875
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,000
methods are really after that the all of

876
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,920
narrow sense heritability

877
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,680
versus GCTA or LD score are at least

878
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,520
somewhat attached to the observed

879
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,400
genetics and so are more in that sniper

880
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,119
heritability H squared G kind of

881
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,480
estimation. uh and some of the

882
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,760
statements about missing heritability

883
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,000
were more concerned about

884
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,359
difference differences down to the the

885
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,680
more PRS or toposai type uh variance

886
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,800
explained

887
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,880
estimates. Um but there are probably

888
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,359
other reasons that due to differences in

889
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,000
in methods that like are more than just

890
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,320
that they're estimating different

891
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,760
quantities. Um, so even between LD score

892
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,680
and GML or GCTA, we observe kind of some

893
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,240
variability where often the LD score

894
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,160
type estimates a little bit lower. Part

895
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,520
of this goes back to more subtle

896
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,440
differences in the quantity they're

897
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,760
estimating. But also there's a lot of

898
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,880
impactful decisions that exist there

899
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,960
about um kind of implementation details

900
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,960
particularly

901
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,599
around treatment of al frequency and how

902
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,960
that contributes to what is the presumed

903
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,560
model of signal in a G-W was um and how

904
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,560
that contributes as far as relative

905
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,440
weight that is captured in a genomic

906
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,160
relatedness matrix. And so you can see

907
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,920
wide variability, you know, in

908
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,760
simulation studies from different

909
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,960
versions of these methods that attack

910
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,800
these questions in different ways and

911
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,800
relative to different underlying genetic

912
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,640
architectures and distributions of where

913
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,760
the causal effects live and things like

914
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,680
that. Uh and so there is room in all of

915
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,520
these methods for different biases to

916
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,200
kind of percolate through and so not

917
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,960
only be estimating different quantities

918
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,680
but also be um

919
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,000
estimating and making different

920
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,599
assumptions about how to get there that

921
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,880
could have biasing effects in in either

922
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,960
direction. Um and this isn't a statement

923
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,400
just about like LDL score and GCTA. This

924
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,760
exists back in the the twin and family

925
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,839
studies as well because we had to make

926
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,560
that assumption about the similarity of

927
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,040
the environment between the identical

928
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,359
twins and the dygotic twins and so if

929
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,760
that violation is assumption is violated

930
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,359
will similarly have biases there where

931
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,520
that might contribute to those higher

932
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,760
heritability estimates as well. Yeah. uh

933
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,160
the estimates from chas data is that

934
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,160
purely additive

935
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,800
uh everything I'm talking I've tried to

936
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,599
summarize here yes there are uh

937
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,320
extensions of both the gcta and ldcore

938
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,880
that also get into dominance effects by

939
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,280
and large kind of searches across traits

940
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,960
with those have found very little signed

941
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,880
dominance effects and trying to do a

942
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,760
dominance g-was

943
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,200
um mostly things that tend to be at low

944
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,480
size that are already well captured by

945
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,920
additive effects and you're just looking

946
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,560
at the residual around that that's

947
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,320
dominance. But that is also in the low

948
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,480
frequencies represented in G-W was as

949
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,160
opposed to kind of more rare variant

950
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,079
studies where we might expect a lot of

951
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,800
more dominant or recessive recessive

952
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,800
acting variants to

953
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:57,200
live. Any other questions or

954
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,200
paused? All

955
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,720
right, cool. Uh so before I move on from

956
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,200
the topic of how we do estimation, just

957
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,800
like a quick highlight of some of the

958
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,280
ways that these things go wrong in their

959
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,359
respective estimation. Um there's kind

960
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,599
of a garbage in garbage out phenomenon

961
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,280
that just because you get to like rely

962
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,040
on somebody else's G-W was doesn't mean

963
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,440
you aren't now attached to the decisions

964
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,119
they made in terms of where measurement

965
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,960
error may have affected their phenotype

966
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,680
where the ascertainment

967
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,920
uh kind of aspects of the study design

968
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,200
uh contribute in

969
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,440
um ancestry and stratification are real

970
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,320
concerns for all of these methods in

971
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,160
terms of needing to different whether

972
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,440
they're ever going to try to differenti

973
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,920
iate ancestry liated signal from overall

974
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,079
genetic signal and if so how they're

975
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,599
going to accomplish that because genetic

976
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,520
similarity between individuals will

977
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,119
include the similarity of their ancestry

978
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,200
unless you do something to try and

979
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,079
portion that out but how successfully

980
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,200
that's done may

981
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,720
vary. Um, we've already talked a bit

982
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,119
about the assumptions that exist around

983
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,160
kind of the environmental piece. Um,

984
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,880
whether that's the shared environment in

985
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,960
related individuals or kind of just

986
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,359
treating it as a residual term that we

987
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
assume to be independent in a GCTA type

988
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,200
model.

989
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,880
Um, and then some of the kind of tricky

990
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,280
aspects that exist around things like

991
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,599
actually applying a correction for

992
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,119
getting to that liability scale amount

993
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,440
of signal off of having an observed uh

994
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,280
binary phenotype. It's easy to state

995
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,359
what we want and as a theoretical

996
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,000
concept generally, but actually getting

997
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,280
that in an unbiased matter uh can be

998
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,599
difficult. There's some standard

999
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,760
transformations that work approximately

1000
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,839
fairly well, but how well they work

1001
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,760
depends a bit on just how common the

1002
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,400
phenotype is and some of the other

1003
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,440
features

1004
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:52,320
there. Uh, cool. So, the the last bit to

1005
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,920
talk about is uh kind of where

1006
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,359
heritability gets into um other related

1007
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,640
uh kind of areas of genetics research.

1008
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,560
And so without having infinite time to

1009
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,760
talk about any any of these in great

1010
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,839
detail, kind of a few places of interest

1011
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,920
that I thought were worth mentioning

1012
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,680
starting with polygenic risk scores. And

1013
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,119
so when I introduced early on, I made

1014
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,119
the note that kind of uh heritability or

1015
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,880
particularly at least a sniper

1016
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,960
heritability kind of exists as a

1017
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,960
theoretical quantity that would be the

1018
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,760
variance explained by our best possible

1019
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,480
genetic predictor. uh including all of

1020
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,240
those kinds of variants. And so, you

1021
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,920
know, for the sake of thinking about

1022
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,560
polygenetic rest scores, this exists as

1023
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,800
kind of the in the infinite data limit,

1024
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,599
we might expect that like we could reach

1025
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,760
that level of predictive

1026
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,839
power, never more than that. And so, how

1027
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,359
that informs on where we think, you

1028
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,480
know, all polygenic horror may or may

1029
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,240
not end up being able to be useful or

1030
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,000
how much it'll contribute at least has

1031
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,800
this kind of theoretical bound on it

1032
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,800
provided by heritability.

1033
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,400
Um, in a more direct sense, even before

1034
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,119
you get to that infinite limit, you can

1035
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,560
derive expectations for how well a PRS

1036
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,280
should predict as a function of

1037
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,520
heritability and the available sample

1038
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,160
size for the the G-W was that V's used

1039
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,400
to create that PRS.

1040
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,520
um which uh generally comes down to a

1041
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,880
function of heritability as well as uh

1042
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,920
so this um this row G term has to do

1043
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,760
with the correlation between the

1044
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,599
discovery sample that was used for G-W

1045
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,920
was and the target sample where you're

1046
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,440
actually applying the PRS. So if there's

1047
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,280
some difference either that you're

1048
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,480
predicting into a different phenotype or

1049
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,720
just there are differences in that

1050
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,960
phenotype that exists between cohorts

1051
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,119
that'll attenuate your prediction and

1052
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,119
then as a function of kind of the the

1053
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,240
the sample size and number of snips

1054
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,880
contributing to that PRS. Um so you can

1055
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,119
get actually the expectations about kind

1056
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,079
of future forecasting of how well a PRS

1057
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,520
should be behaving that come out of

1058
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,520
heritability. Um and even in the

1059
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,760
construction of polygenic risk scores a

1060
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,640
number of the kind of polygenic risk

1061
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,960
scoring methods now uh kind of

1062
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,440
incorporate heritability as part of

1063
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,920
setting priors for expectations about

1064
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,680
the distribution of effect sizes to more

1065
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,440
robustly estimate the effect sizes that

1066
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,760
should be used as the coefficients for

1067
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,440
constructing a polygenic score. So the

1068
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,920
example equation here comes from LD

1069
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,760
prred um that I won't belabor the

1070
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,079
details on but are basically getting

1071
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,200
expectations about those effect sizes

1072
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,480
that depend again on sniper

1073
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,200
heritability. Um another place where we

1074
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,800
see heritability pop up as kind of

1075
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,319
conceptually related is thinking about

1076
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,040
enrichment testing for various

1077
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,119
enrichments of signal across the genome.

1078
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,200
And this kind of follows from the idea

1079
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,240
that our null hypothesis for most

1080
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,319
enrichment testing is some idea that the

1081
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,319
genetic effects that exist for a given

1082
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,280
phenotype are kind of uniformly

1083
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,119
distributed across the genome. Um, and

1084
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,920
we're looking for places where that

1085
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,560
doesn't actually follow and that we have

1086
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,720
some enrichment in some place. And so

1087
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,040
one way we can formalize that and get to

1088
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,599
the quantities of estimation is if we

1089
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,640
can estimate heritability in some subset

1090
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,079
of the genome whether that's you know

1091
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,480
separate regions or snips that have some

1092
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:21,520
annotation or some concept like that and

1093
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,240
get heritability that is specific to uh

1094
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,240
that category these C's here and

1095
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,000
relative to um kind of the the size of

1096
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,880
that annotation or how many snips are

1097
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,200
present in that that relative signal in

1098
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,280
that category to the overall

1099
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,240
heritability in kind of a uniform

1100
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,760
expectation across all snips gets a

1101
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,800
natural statement as far as what we mean

1102
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,800
by this quantity of

1103
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,920
enrichment. Um and that you know enables

1104
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,160
all the things we see in terms of

1105
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,160
talking about enrichment in uh signal

1106
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,720
and GWA studies. So things like looking

1107
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,960
at enrichment of signal in conserved

1108
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,640
regions or in regions that are

1109
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,640
associated with um expression or open

1110
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,280
chromatin in particular cell or tissue

1111
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,040
types um and all those kind of secondary

1112
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,880
analyses of G-W was to try and pull out

1113
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,560
this kind of signal relative to a

1114
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,880
baseline measure of how much overall

1115
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:18,119
signal there is that is showing up in

1116
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,119
different places.

1117
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,520
Um, heritability is also stepping to

1118
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,920
stone towards other kind of genetic

1119
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,160
architecture parameters. They kind of

1120
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,720
live as extensions of that same kind of

1121
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,680
model of a phenotype is simply genetics

1122
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,119
plus environment. And so, oh, one common

1123
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,960
direction of that is genetic correlation

1124
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,920
where we say now we have that same model

1125
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,280
but exists for two different

1126
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,440
phenotypes. And then our genetic

1127
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,359
correlation is defined kind of by the

1128
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,440
correlation between the genetic

1129
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,079
component of crate 1 and the genetic

1130
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,280
component of crate 2. And to estimate

1131
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,040
that it often is you know occurs that

1132
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,200
we'll have some estimator for the

1133
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,720
covariance of those two terms and

1134
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,119
standardize that relative to the

1135
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,640
heritability of the two phenotypes. And

1136
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,119
that again gets us to our genetic

1137
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,640
correlation. So kind of extending from

1138
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,640
that one phenotype

1139
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,119
um that one phenotype variance parameter

1140
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,160
now to a coariance parameter and getting

1141
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,079
these now these statements about

1142
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,079
correlation across phenotypes extending

1143
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,920
that idea. Um and so wrong direction

1144
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,800
there. And so again this is has been

1145
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,560
done increasingly across phenotypes uh

1146
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,359
and observing kind of pervasive genetic

1147
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,359
correlations in various domains.

1148
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,240
Um, and it turns out that like even

1149
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,079
beyond genetic correlation, um, other

1150
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,160
kind of moments of that distribution of

1151
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,000
effect sizes that live kind of in that

1152
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,440
that same space of ideas are also

1153
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,200
informative about aspects of genetic

1154
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,000
architecture. Um, so this pair of papers

1155
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,480
from Luc Connor and Alcus Price kind of

1156
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,839
get into how some of these quantities

1157
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,839
also manifest in asking questions about

1158
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:58,000
polygenicity or about causal

1159
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:00,880
relationships. again coming from uh

1160
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,040
these same kind of extensions of

1161
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,640
parameters of

1162
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,960
architecture. Um and then lastly in

1163
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,280
thinking about kind of uh selection or

1164
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,079
population genetic forces, heritability

1165
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,599
also lives in expectations about the

1166
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,000
kind of relationship between strength of

1167
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,480
selection on a phenotype and how much

1168
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,960
impact that'll actually have in shifting

1169
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,880
genetic drift over time um and how much

1170
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,800
the the phenotype will actually be able

1171
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,680
to move in response to the selective

1172
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,680
pressure on the the phenotype. Um so

1173
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,680
kind of the these fundamental quantities

1174
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,480
just connect in many ways um kind of

1175
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,240
across our landscape of genetic

1176
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,280
research. Uh so just to kind of wrap up

1177
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,119
again the rundown here. So again

1178
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,440
heritability is conceptually this

1179
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,440
proportion of phenotypic variance uh

1180
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,079
that can be attributed to genetics in

1181
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,760
some form or another but is very much a

1182
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,160
population parameter and not a statement

1183
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,119
about our ability to intervene. We have

1184
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,720
a multitude of methods for uh estimating

1185
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,119
this from those old twin and family

1186
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,560
studies into methods using G-W was data

1187
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,920
that each come with kind of their

1188
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,560
various hiccups and things to be

1189
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,960
concerned about um in how we estimate

1190
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,640
them. But by and large the takeaways

1191
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,920
have been that we observe lots of

1192
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,000
heritability across the human genome. Um

1193
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,599
and this is informative both for those

1194
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,400
estimates directly and in the ways those

1195
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,839
estimates inform uh uh everything else.

1196
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,760
And so the the slides will be

1197
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,839
distributed and also has an appendex

1198
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,400
full of kind of related resources and uh

1199
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:29,599
publications. Um but hopefully that you

1200
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,720
know it's covered the space as far as

1201
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,720
getting introduced to the idea

1202
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:44,160
here. We are almost well we're at time.

1203
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,200
Um if anyone has a question they can

1204
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,000
come up to the mic. Um I do have one

1205
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,920
from online uh from anonymous attendee.

1206
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,440
There's one there's a question about is

1207
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,119
um are there any problems if we are

1208
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,119
comparing heritability across

1209
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,119
populations?

1210
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,560
Yeah. So

1211
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:08,240
the for comparing comprehensive across

1212
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:10,800
populations conceptually it's possible

1213
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,960
um but often the thing that emerges is

1214
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,800
that matching all of the features of the

1215
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,000
studies to actually make that an

1216
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,079
applesto apples comparison can be quite

1217
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,440
difficult and so like I mentioned that

1218
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,359
even things like measurement error will

1219
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,440
affect this and that is that like if you

1220
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,359
have measured a phenotype comparatively

1221
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,760
worse and just have more measurement

1222
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,680
error in there the that'll lower the

1223
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,200
heritability as an overall proportion of

1224
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,559
that variance. And so by no statement

1225
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,800
about how much genetics actually

1226
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,960
contributes to some like true trait

1227
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,119
there, um you'll observe differences.

1228
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,040
And so getting those kind of features

1229
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,559
comparable is quite difficult. Um so

1230
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,160
even while in principle that kind of

1231
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,599
comparison should be possible, in

1232
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,599
practice it's quite difficult.

1233
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,760
Thanks for beautifully clear talk. Um,

1234
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,079
early on you mentioned that there's this

1235
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,000
fundamental ambiguity of interpretation

1236
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,079
between kind of like direct causal maybe

1237
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,839
mechanistic style effects versus ability

1238
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,839
to predict. And I just wanted you to say

1239
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,200
more about your views on that if you

1240
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,400
view that as something that the field

1241
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,640
needs to grapple with and help

1242
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:20,000
disambiguate by I don't know introducing

1243
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,000
more concepts or or if it's something we

1244
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,400
should live with and if that's dangerous

1245
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,720
etc. Thanks. Yeah, it's a good question.

1246
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,000
Um I think there are there there's a

1247
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,319
place in the world for both versions of

1248
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,520
thinking about that

1249
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:35,119
estimation and most of the challenges

1250
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,520
arise in the fact that we are applying

1251
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,520
the same name of heritability to mean

1252
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,440
possibly either of those concepts and

1253
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,760
thus implementing methods that attack it

1254
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,839
in different ways.

1255
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,000
Um the the version that is best possible

1256
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,040
prediction is certainly easier to get at

1257
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,079
because then you can think of the

1258
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:57,040
environment is solely the residual piece

1259
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,359
and it also gets you out of some of the

1260
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,240
problems that also exist in GIWAS about

1261
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,480
you know well whether it be

1262
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,920
stratification or effects that are the

1263
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,680
environment that comes from your parents

1264
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,440
and so is correlated with the genetics

1265
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,359
but has nothing to do with how the

1266
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,200
actual inherited genetics are acting

1267
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,440
that will show up in G-W bus signal

1268
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,040
unless you're doing within family study.

1269
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,200
All those pieces are much harder

1270
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:23,839
to practically deal with. But there's,

1271
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,920
you know, there is still value to

1272
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:30,160
wanting to think about the quantity that

1273
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,800
is the like true underlying like causal

1274
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,200
effect of the genetics and having a name

1275
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,599
for that and thinking that in concept.

1276
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,280
Um, it's just a a practical difficulty

1277
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,960
in terms of making sure that we are

1278
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,800
thinking clearly about what we've

1279
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,800
estimated and what that actually says

1280
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,880
versus what we might wish we could get

1281
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,319
to and like thinking about where the

1282
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,520
pitfalls are. If what we want to think

1283
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,520
about is the causal effect version.
