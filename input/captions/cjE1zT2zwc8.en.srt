1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,000
for the kind introduction it's a

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:08,080
pleasure to be here today and to talk to

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,599
you about building an aviation system

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,200
that can connect the world while at the

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,920
same time hopefully doing so with near

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,600
zero environmental

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,359
impacts so as I address this question

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,080
I'm trying to do this in three questions

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,599
today I will start by actually trying to

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,960
give you a sense of where the impact of

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,480
Aviation on the atmosphere spe

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,640
specifically on climate and air

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,239
pollution is actually coming from giving

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,200
you a baseline understanding then we use

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
that Baseline understanding to actually

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,399
strategically think about what are the

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,520
key technologies that we need to

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,399
actually get to this near zero

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,199
goal then you have a set of Peace meal

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,520
Technologies so we will talk about how

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,239
can we bring these Technologies together

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,559
into an aviation system that can

23
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,719
actually work connect the world with

24
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,960
near zero environmental impacts

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,799
so I don't have lots of time let's jump

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
right into it and let's start with the

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,000
first question so where do the impacts

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,520
of Aviation on the environment actually

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,200
come from let's start with climate if

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,520
you talk about climate impacts of

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,439
Aviation you probably have heard a ton

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,320
of different metrics on how you can

33
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,400
measure the climate impact of Aviation

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,360
you've probably had CO2 and global

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,920
warming potential and all this kind of

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,680
stuff I will use a metric that is

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,960
actually environmental cost cost to the

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,840
society because of these climate impacts

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,840
of Aviation how does that work well you

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,360
look at a unit of fuel burnt so a ton of

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,439
fuel you track that to the emissions

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,040
that come out of the jet engine you

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,079
track that to everything that happens in

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,560
the atmosphere until you actually get

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,240
concentration of greenhouse gases you

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,280
track that to warming and you track that

47
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,880
to socioeconomic impacts like for

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,920
example changes to agricultural yields

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,240
or for example Environmental disas

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,719
disasters similar to the social cost of

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,920
carbon so let me show you how that

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,599
assessment actually looks like so if you

53
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,239
look at a ton of fuel you actually have

54
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,040
some emissions that actually are cooling

55
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,440
so that's why you start with a negative

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,040
cost but then if you look at the cooling

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,760
component you see it's basically driven

58
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,440
by two effects one it's driven by CO2

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,080
that's no surprise to anybody in the

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,160
room because that is driven by you know

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,239
the fossil fuel use meaning we take

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,400
carbon from the geosphere and from crude

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,120
oil refine it combust it release the CO2

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,440
into the atmosphere increase atmospheric

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,840
CO2 concentration which contributes to

66
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,640
warming you all know that however the

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,519
effect of Aviation doesn't stop here it

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,599
also includes contrails condensation

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,560
Trails the white line shaped ice clouds

70
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,840
that you sometimes see forming behind an

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,760
aircraft what this actually is is it is

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,800
an icecloud it forms when the conditions

73
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,760
are sufficiently cool cool sufficiently

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,519
humid so that water which is in the

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,799
exhaust of the exhaust stream of the

76
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,840
aircraft so that first condenses and

77
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,840
then freezes so that you get an ice

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,760
Cloud many situations if you look up

79
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,519
into a sky you see something like on

80
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,680
this picture this is actually what we

81
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,959
call a non-persistent contrail that only

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,360
lasts seconds to minutes we don't

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,680
actually worry about those guys what we

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,640
worry about are these condensation

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,400
trails that actually last for long

86
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,959
periods of times possibly staying linear

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,319
potentially becoming diffused and even

88
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,599
indistinguishable from natural cus

89
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,680
clouds it's these clouds that have been

90
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,360
shown to be warming on

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,720
average however we do need to note this

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,040
impact is still subject to substantial

93
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,040
uncertainty so this effect may be a

94
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,360
little smaller a little larger however

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,680
the consensus is there's still

96
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,640
warming so this is the climate part of

97
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,280
the equation what's often forgotten is

98
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,480
Aviation also has an air pollution

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,120
contribution

100
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,480
where does this come from well we have

101
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,560
aircraft emission aircraft emissions

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,840
directly or indirectly lead to the

103
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,360
formation of air pollutants specifically

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,920
ozone and fine particulate matter and

105
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,639
that has Health impacts and you see this

106
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,239
impact isn't small it's actually on the

107
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,320
same order of magnitude again as CO2 and

108
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,520
it's mostly driven by nox

109
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,440
emissions so overall this externality I

110
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,440
I promised you a dollar metric is about

111
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,680
$860 per ton of fuel burnt a ton of fuel

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,960
costs about $730 right now so we are

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,240
talking a number which is very similar

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,440
to the cost of fuel but just to give you

115
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,320
a sense how large this climate and air

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
pollution externality for Aviation

117
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,479
really

118
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,600
is now this chart also leads you

119
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,199
directly into our second question so

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,280
what are the key technologies that we

121
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,440
now need to solve the problem well three

122
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,000
things right we need to worry about the

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,639
CO2 I talked about it this this is

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,560
really the low carbon energy transition

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,240
for the aviation sector because we need

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
to get away from fossil fuel use the

127
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,160
second thing we need to worry about is

128
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,680
contrails we need to avoid them

129
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,280
otherwise we can't get to near zero and

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,039
we need to worry about nox emissions

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,400
from aircraft engines and we need to get

132
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,479
rid of that as well so what we need to

133
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,360
do is talk through these three areas and

134
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,600
see what technologies we have to solve

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,319
the problem so let's do it let's start

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,120
with the low carbon energy transition as

137
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,120
I mentioned before here we really need

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,680
to get away from this Paradigm of fossil

139
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,280
fuel use first step we can take is use

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,479
drop in fuels we call them sustainable

141
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,520
Aviation fuels fuels you can use in

142
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,120
existing aircraft that look chemically

143
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,680
very similar

144
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,880
to Fossil Jed a however now you may say

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,560
well if this is chemically very similar

146
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,280
then it's a hydrocarbon which means if

147
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,880
you combust it you will release C2 into

148
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,120
the atmosphere the trick here is it's a

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,080
typical biof field trick you actually

150
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
try to sequester that carbon from the

151
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,880
atmosphere first as you make for example

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,680
your biomass feed stock and then

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,800
re-release it so you get this perfect

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,280
carbon cycle so this is how you can get

155
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,360
to zero obviously now you can get

156
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,199
worried about the scalability of the

157
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,319
biosphere to really produce all this

158
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,520
feed stock so you may want to do the

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,960
same thing with direct air capture as a

160
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,599
technology combine that carbon with

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
hydrogen and make a fuel out of that

162
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,039
yeah you can do this as

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
well however the base problem is that

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,919
jet fuel is basically a longchain

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,039
hydrocarbon it's a lot of carbon atoms

166
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,599
in a row so making that is a very energy

167
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,759
intensive process so are we better off

168
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,360
using this energy directly and put that

169
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,360
on board the aircraft in a non-rop in

170
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,680
fuel for example hydrogen or maybe even

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,440
the electric aircraft well if we want to

172
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,960
do this this obviously becomes an

173
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,599
aircraft level challenge and we know

174
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,680
that the electric aircraft doesn't

175
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,599
really solve that easy easily we also

176
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,520
know none of this actually has direct

177
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,560
CO2 emissions but we need to consider

178
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,479
the emissions in the supply chain to see

179
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,039
how close to zero we really get but

180
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,840
that's true for South as well and this

181
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,199
will come back in a

182
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,000
moment so that's the CO2 question we

183
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,520
know how we can attack that although

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,599
lots of work still to do second thing

185
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,680
that we need to do is we need to avoid

186
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,280
contrasts so what are we doing about

187
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,240
contrs well here lots of things are

188
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,039
being discussed you can change engines

189
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,080
and fuels to solve the problem however

190
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,479
one thing that people are really excited

191
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,440
about is flight path deviations changing

192
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,280
your flight path why you know that from

193
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,960
your own field experiment you looked up

194
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,000
into the air and not every flight makes

195
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,879
a

196
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,120
contrail so why is that because the

197
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,960
contol only forms if it's sufficiently

198
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,800
cold and sufficiently humid that's not

199
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,680
always the case so why don't we fly

200
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,639
around regions where contrails would

201
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,599
form

202
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,159
well that sounds like a good and very

203
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,479
intuitive approach and you can do that

204
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:09,039
horizontally you can fly around it but

205
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,960
the point is that these contal forming

206
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,960
regions are very flat they're very thin

207
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,520
a little pancake shaped so you can just

208
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,720
dive underneath or climb above them to

209
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,720
avoid the problem usually just a few

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,759
thousand feet now this is obviously

211
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,680
subject to a fuel burn trade-off because

212
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
you're not flying your optimal flight

213
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,120
anymore however the literature clearly

214
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,839
says that this fuel this benefit is very

215
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,440
small and likely outweighed by far by

216
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,479
the control

217
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,399
benefit now you might say why don't we

218
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,839
do this this sounds like a very cool

219
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,519
thing right so easy to do you have a

220
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,519
flight he has a cut through a flight

221
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,240
path Red Line you see it flies through a

222
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,240
contra forming region you take the green

223
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,279
line fly around it problem solved sounds

224
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,640
like something we could do today right

225
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,480
well not so fast because if you want to

226
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,680
be successful about this you have to be

227
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,079
right about two things

228
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,040
one actually have to be sure that the

229
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:07,560
flight would actually form a contrail if

230
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,120
you didn't reroute

231
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,200
it so that's Point number one which is

232
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,120
actually hard point number two that's

233
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,079
actually hard is you need to reroute the

234
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,640
flight into a region where it won't form

235
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,360
a contrail you need to know that as well

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,200
and you want to be as close to the to

237
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,959
your original flight path to minimize

238
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,880
your fuel band penalty it turns out this

239
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,200
is a really tough data Challenge and

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,320
we're doing a lot of research on this to

241
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
really figure out how we can dependably

242
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,920
do

243
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,320
this so lots of work still to be done

244
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,360
last problem aircraft nox

245
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,000
reductions this is something that we

246
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,720
rethought a little bit where we looked

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,800
at what can you actually what actually

248
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,399
do other sectors do to solve this

249
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,200
problem so look at Road Transportation

250
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:54,279
look at Power Generation in both cases

251
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,760
the way they solve the problem

252
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,640
is emissions control devices we don't do

253
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,880
that in aviation why not because

254
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,279
historically we couldn't because the

255
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,680
mass flow from a gastr is just too high

256
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,480
to put it through a catalytic converter

257
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,440
but with smaller gas turbines that we're

258
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,839
getting smaller course we start to be

259
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,240
able to do this but then still you don't

260
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,200
want to put a long bulky emissions

261
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,959
control device under the wing way too

262
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,399
much drag so how would you do this well

263
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:23,440
you would put the gas turbine in the

264
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,200
fuselage of the aircraft put the

265
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,040
emissions control behind it and have the

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,920
gas turbine actually produce power and

267
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,320
then use electric motors under the wing

268
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,600
to actually drive the aircraft turns out

269
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,720
if you do this furn penalty less than 1%

270
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,920
nox reduction about

271
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,440
95% so off the shelf you you may be able

272
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,760
to do this now we have three peace meal

273
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,240
Technologies can we put it together in a

274
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,279
coherent system in a system that has low

275
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,279
carbon energy that has our nox reduction

276
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,399
technology and that has control

277
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,279
avoidance well if you want to do this

278
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,160
you have to redesign your aircraft

279
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,959
around hydrogen around post combustion

280
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,320
emissions control and we can do this and

281
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,240
we did it for a 220 seat aircraft so

282
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,160
roughly like your Boeing

283
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,440
73710 or like your Airbus a321 3,000

284
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,279
nautical mile range we found a solution

285
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,560
big question is is this solution worth

286
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,839
it for

287
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,839
society so for that I'm going to go full

288
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,639
circle I'm going to go back to the very

289
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,200
beginning and you've basically seen this

290
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,440
chart it shows you the environmental

291
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,680
impacts of a conventional aircraft

292
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,920
climate and air quality this time not

293
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,959
per unit fuel bur but scaled to the

294
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,320
network that we're modeling

295
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,480
here and we put on top the fuel cost the

296
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,360
private cost of operating the system you

297
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,240
could also add other Airline operating

298
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,800
costs but we assume they don't really

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,839
change so we didn't add them here now

300
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,040
the big question is does this overall

301
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,000
environment societal cost of operating

302
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,480
the system go down if I go to our zero

303
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,639
impact aircraft here's the one that's

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,839
driven by sustainable aviation fuel you

305
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,440
see it does go down why because we get

306
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
the environmental cost to near zero fuel

307
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,959
is not entirely zero you have to do a

308
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,399
little bit of carbon removal but then

309
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,880
the fuel is much more expensive Factor

310
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,279
2.3 that's what we have here it's a very

311
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,120
expensive saf but it's worth it you do

312
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,760
get an overall cost reduction now the

313
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,120
question is is hydrogen better did the

314
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,959
same thing we modeled the hydrogen

315
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,079
aircraft you see it basic basically is

316
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,760
can do the same thing the cost reduction

317
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,160
is a little higher is because the energy

318
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,240
is a little cheaper which actually is a

319
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,079
trade-off because the aircraft needs a

320
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,279
little more energy but the fuel is more

321
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,040
expensive but still it's a little better

322
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,760
I wouldn't say this is conclusive at

323
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,959
this

324
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,399
point so what does this all lead to and

325
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,120
we imagine a zero impact air

326
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,800
transportation sector yeah I think this

327
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,040
is possible these were the three key

328
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,639
technologies that we just talked about

329
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,120
you didn't hear me talk about technical

330
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,040
efficiency your operational efficiency

331
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,600
why because it's not at the core of the

332
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,760
problem but it's very important you saw

333
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,320
the energy cost increase we need to be

334
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,800
as efficient as we can possibly be to

335
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
make this

336
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,399
work from here there's a lot left to do

337
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
that we're doing improving our

338
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,079
understanding of impacts and

339
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,560
Technologies that's what we do in the

340
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,279
lab for Aviation and the environment

341
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
here at MIT and we need to work with

342
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,440
Partners in the value chain to really

343
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
figure out how we can overcome the

344
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,480
hurdles to really get to the goal we're

345
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
working on that on the Zero impact

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,880
Aviation lines with that I'll leave it

347
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,440
there and um do I still have a time for

348
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,440
a question or

349
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,000
two okay we can take the first one do

350
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,079
contrast reflect any sunlight like was

351
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,880
recently recovered absolutely so the

352
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:51,480
point about contrails is not every

353
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,759
contrail is warming a contrail is like a

354
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,519
normal Cloud what it does is every

355
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,240
Contra does two things reflects incoming

356
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,800
sunlight which is a cooling impact and

357
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,000
it traps out going heat and for every

358
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,880
contrail whether it's warming or cooling

359
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it's a balance of those two effects so

360
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,959
there are contrails that absolutely are

361
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,440
cooling there are also cont controls

362
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,399
that absolutely are warming every

363
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,399
nighttime contol is warming because it

364
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,120
doesn't have the reflection component so

365
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,680
what I told you is the average contrail

366
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,639
is warming however that can be cooling

367
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,759
contrails so that's very important to to

368
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:30,320
know okay perfect thank you very

369
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,320
much thank you leing fascinating thank

370
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,480
you so

371
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,320
much all right our next talk on the

372
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,160
carbonizing the industry I invite

373
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,079
Professor Jam tasan to speak about

374
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,720
sustainable steel Professor tasan is a

375
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,480
professor of Metallurgy in the

376
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,560
department Material Science and

377
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,560
Engineering at MIT professor

378
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,740
[Applause]

379
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,279
all right can everybody hear

380
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,199
me hi everybody um I'm my name is Jam

381
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,720
Tashan thank you for the invitation I'm

382
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,279
an associate professor in the department

383
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,480
of Material Science and Engineering here

384
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,120
at MIT and the work that I'm going to

385
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,680
talk about today is about steel making

386
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,279
and it's carried out mostly by postto in

387
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,000
my group who's also here with me Dr

388
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,920
honor Guan and other co-workers in our

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,600
group so the question on a Tuesday

390
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,680
afternoon at 4:30 might be do we really

391
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,959
need to talk about steel um and the

392
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,920
answer is yes uh so if you look at the

393
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:50,160
steel production uh in the short term um

394
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,600
you see a clear increase if you look at

395
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,079
projections uh about steel manufacturing

396
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,360
you also you know if you look at

397
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,560
projections going forward decades you

398
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,759
see an increase in steel uh steel

399
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,319
production that is projected now this is

400
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,480
for a reason we need steel and we will

401
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:10,000
keep on needing steel I don't know how

402
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,120
many talks you hear from MIT that talks

403
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,639
about new materials graphine and you

404
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,079
know spider silk and so forth we will

405
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,680
still need steel to do things now if you

406
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,079
look at the applications for which we

407
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,839
need steel some of these are very

408
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,600
demanding applications right so there's

409
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,720
a reason why we call this guy the Man of

410
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,560
Steel when you think about steel you

411
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,639
think about these demanding applications

412
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,759
right so so automotive industry you

413
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,319
think about bridges you know suspension

414
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,639
bridges and those cables that carry

415
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,440
those bridges and you nowadays you even

416
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,199
think about you know

417
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,759
spacecraft but also when we talk about

418
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,920
steel there are all those less demanding

419
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,319
applications any more or less any

420
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,240
restaurant that you would walk in in

421
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,399
Cambridge or in Boston if you could find

422
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,720
your way to the kitchen and take a look

423
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,319
at the um tabl Toops there you would see

424
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,639
that it's often stainless steel and

425
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,199
garbage cans and containers and all kind

426
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,600
of other things and this is not just a

427
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,679
standing Trend if you look at the

428
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,439
numbers again for instance the new

429
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
constructions over the over the years

430
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,039
looking at projections of new

431
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,079
constructions household appliances uh

432
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,360
you know air conditionings worldwide Etc

433
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,760
it's all increasing we will we use steel

434
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,679
and we will need steel so what's the

435
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,280
problem the problem is steel making is

436
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,039
demanding of course you hear about this

437
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,439
very very often but looking at numbers

438
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,199
is kind of shocking often so if you take

439
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,919
Hut roll steel for instance and if you

440
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,520
look at primary steel making so blast

441
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,799
furnaces and just take a look at these

442
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,400
numbers here this is really gigantic

443
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:39,799
both from an energy consumption

444
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,160
perspective and also from CO2 emissions

445
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,520
perspective now we often talk about

446
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,480
electric Arc furnaces and how it's much

447
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,840
better but because the numbers are so

448
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
large while it's much better in terms of

449
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,160
the energy penalty and in terms of CO2

450
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,039
emissions it's still gigantic now this

451
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,880
is sort of things that you often talk

452
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,919
about or or read about but there's also

453
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,000
additional challenges for instance

454
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,400
related with water consumption related

455
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,960
with steel uh processing so this is a

456
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
very demanding industry it's one of the

457
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,120
most demanding industries that we have

458
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,520
as humankind now if you want to think

459
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,760
about the solution for this we need to

460
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
look at the current processing

461
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,559
Technologies as most of you would know

462
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,320
we produce Steel in two different ways

463
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,360
you can start from an iron ore put it in

464
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,240
a blast furnace and go then through a

465
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,200
basic oxygen furnace continuous casting

466
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,159
rolling in some finishing treatments and

467
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,159
then you get this coil you make a car

468
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,640
out of it or you can start from a steel

469
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,799
scrap use an electric Arc furnace melt

470
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,840
it cast it and and similar steps now the

471
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,000
problem here from the pers from our

472
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,159
perspective is related with this initial

473
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,520
initial part now what you would notice

474
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,159
there is that we are dealing with liquid

475
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,480
metal and when we deal with liquid metal

476
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,400
then we need to increase the

477
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,159
temperatures we need very complicated

478
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,960
equipment we need very demanding

479
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,440
processes and that's the core reason why

480
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,440
this is so energy intensive and it's so

481
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,000
uh CO2 emitting now if there would be a

482
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,400
way to deal with steel in a solid state

483
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
life would be easier but it's of course

484
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,559
not so easy now this is what honor and I

485
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,720
have been working on for a while now for

486
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,440
it's been three four years where we are

487
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,640
trying to transform steel scrap to sheet

488
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,240
metal without melting it now you start

489
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,039
from a steel scrap you put it in an

490
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,559
envelope you know imagine pieces of

491
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,440
scrap you put it in an envelope and then

492
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,200
you roll it so that you can diffuse

493
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,880
bonded into a sheet and then you coil it

494
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,720
so that now now you have a coiled

495
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,000
steel now it looks very nice on a

496
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,760
PowerPoint uh you know schematic here

497
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,600
but obviously many of you would look at

498
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,880
this and already start thinking that it

499
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,200
may not be possible so easily for all

500
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,039
those kind of different

501
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,360
challenges and but if it were possible

502
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,720
just imagine the level of Energy savings

503
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,679
and CO2 emissions and you know capex

504
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,400
savings and so forth it it would be

505
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,159
pretty great now what owner has been

506
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,120
doing over the last few years is

507
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,120
literally trying tens of samples of

508
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,720
Steel sheet metal scrap industrial metal

509
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,679
scrap even corroded metal scrap using it

510
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,559
in our technology to make them into

511
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,240
coils and then to make them into sheets

512
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,799
rather and then mechanically test them

513
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,720
to demonstrate that this is actually

514
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,480
possible so this is actually possible we

515
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,000
can do it in our lab right now now when

516
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,039
you hear this kind of Technology there

517
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,960
are many reasons to be skeptical believe

518
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,880
believe me I I've been very skeptical

519
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,440
about this myself and I'm going to go

520
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,679
now one by one over each of these

521
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,159
concerns and hopefully show you that

522
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,960
there there's actually not so much of a

523
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,520
reason to be skeptical so let's start

524
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,559
with the first one now you think about

525
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,720
scrap and you think about bonding them

526
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,799
into a sheet that sounds like a terrible

527
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,600
idea because when you think about scrap

528
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,360
you think about the junkyard and all

529
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,840
these corroded irregularly shaped

530
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,799
components how are we even make them

531
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,640
into a into a sheet like you can't

532
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,120
really roll Bond these things and there

533
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,039
would be rust layers right oxide layers

534
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,600
well first of all keep in mind here what

535
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,200
we are talking about is high quality

536
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,039
manufacturing scrap so we are not

537
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,400
talking about junkyard scrap we are

538
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,080
talking about manufacturing scrap here

539
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,440
so form and damage factor is on our side

540
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,880
so what does that mean if you make a

541
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,600
simple plot here so in the y- AIS I have

542
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,279
shape change um and in the x-axis I have

543
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,080
the amount of damage or the locality of

544
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,000
damage so if you are thinking about an

545
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,320
end of life steel product ideally for

546
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,720
reuse or reapplication the opportunities

547
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,799
in this lower um left

548
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,240
quadrant if we have small amount of shap

549
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,000
change at the end of life and if we have

550
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,919
localized damage it's much more easy to

551
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,720
reuse it and Manufacturing scrap

552
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,240
actually falls into into this category

553
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,039
so there's an opportunity here now the

554
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,480
second point is that we've actually been

555
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,400
doing all these tests so we've been

556
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,600
doing test after test and what we see is

557
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,360
that you need to develop the right

558
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,559
processing regimes to be able to achieve

559
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,640
bonding so here for instance in the

560
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,480
xaxis you see processing temperature so

561
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,000
this is a hot rolling process in the y-

562
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
axis you see amount of reduction so how

563
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,400
much you reduce the thickness as you

564
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,480
roll versus how hot it is and basically

565
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,559
for all kind of different materials you

566
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,360
can see stainless steel mild Steel in in

567
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,840
that batch in those curves you get a

568
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,960
proc you get a line that determines the

569
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,559
regime of um bondability so basically as

570
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,400
you go from uh to the other side of the

571
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,640
red curve on stainless steel you would

572
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,159
always get bonding and for mild steel

573
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,400
basically more or less all you need to

574
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,559
do is go above 800° then you would

575
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,840
always get bonding based on our

576
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:34,520
experiments so there's really no reason

577
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,600
to be skeptical about not having bonding

578
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,000
so then you might say well I might Bond

579
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,880
these things but will they be usable

580
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,760
will you be able to do something with it

581
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,279
will it be formable so that I can make

582
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,799
something else from it uh you can

583
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,600
imagine for instance that there could be

584
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,880
gaps well basically what we've done is

585
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,640
all kind of mechanical testing uh that

586
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,880
shows that the formability of these

587
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,640
scrap bonded sheets are similar to

588
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,400
monolithic sheets of the same grade of

589
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,600
Steel so you can you can have the same

590
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,080
forming Behavior here here in fact I I

591
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
really like this image this is from one

592
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,279
of our graduate students who carried out

593
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,880
this measurement forming experiment the

594
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,000
sample is basically as the size of my

595
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
hand here palm of my hand and it shows

596
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,440
how formable these Steels can be you can

597
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,320
really deep draw these guys and the

598
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,640
reason for this is that the bonds that

599
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,279
we generate are pretty strong so now now

600
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,880
it's real science you are looking at

601
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,880
this is an insm experiment we actually

602
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,600
put a mechanical deformation device in a

603
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,720
scanning electron microscope so that we

604
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,600
can see these bonds here so now I so so

605
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,600
that you can easily see the bones I put

606
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,640
these lines over there so now we are

607
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
going to pull this in the horizontal

608
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,520
direction and you would expect that I

609
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,559
have this maybe imperfect Bond there so

610
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,880
it's going to collapse from that Bond

611
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,960
and fracture and what you actually see

612
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,679
as you pull this is that it seems like

613
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,919
it's going to indeed develop over that

614
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,240
Bond but afterwards it actually turns

615
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,760
right so the bond stays intact and the

616
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,400
crack appear somewhere else so by

617
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,919
bonding actually you can create um a

618
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,720
material response that's stronger than

619
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,039
the bulk response um of the

620
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,679
material now there are other examples of

621
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:07,360
this so this is for instance looking at

622
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,480
another cavity again in an electron

623
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,480
microscope we are Banning this to see if

624
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,159
this cavity will grow or rather if this

625
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,039
cavity will lead to cracking incidents

626
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,520
and it doesn't you see some growth but

627
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,640
you start from a five Micron crack and

628
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,320
now it becomes six microns it's nothing

629
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,480
basically from a stress

630
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,080
perspective all right so the next

631
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,159
question might be well you you might say

632
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,039
well you might be making the these uh

633
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,880
you know roll bonded sheets of scrap but

634
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,080
it might it still might not be feasible

635
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,840
there might be no real business case for

636
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,240
this well then you might the the very

637
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,399
here might be related with scrap

638
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,600
availability or scaling of the process

639
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:45,520
that I'm mentioning after all we are in

640
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,080
a lab here at the moment in terms of SC

641
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,919
scrap uh scrap availability basically

642
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,480
there is no concern I provide you some

643
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,520
data here and there is much many other

644
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,799
data available in the literature that

645
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,640
there is enough there's going to be

646
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,799
enough scrap and also there's going to

647
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,919
be enough manufacturing scrap to be able

648
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:04,960
to realize a technology of this sort and

649
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,120
in terms of uh whether this process can

650
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,159
be scaled up this is a recent patent

651
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,720
from owners work that shows that

652
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,120
basically you can do what we do in the

653
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,279
lab in a manual way in a in a scaled

654
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,360
continuous process a process that

655
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,919
essentially combines in our minds at

656
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,080
least it combines pipe M pipe making and

657
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,159
and rolling so this is what's going to

658
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,039
be happening next in our in our activity

659
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,440
now another reason to be skeptical might

660
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,200
be you know having a business case I

661
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,240
mean Metallurgy is a relatively old

662
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,080
field and there's a lot of inertia for

663
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,120
Change and even the typical example I

664
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,279
give is that even if I invent the next

665
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,159
best automotive steel and I go to

666
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,919
automotive industry and say this now I

667
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,880
have a new steel for you that's 50%

668
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,120
better than your current steel they say

669
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,760
it's great and then it takes 20 years

670
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,200
for them to use them in their cars

671
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,200
typically so it's a it's a slow industry

672
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,320
how do we deal with it well it turns out

673
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,880
that there's a very actually nice uh U

674
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,880
business model for this now the steel

675
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,640
industry normally works in a way where

676
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,559
you produce steel steel manufacturer

677
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,520
produce steel sends it to a fabricator

678
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,640
the fabricator makes a car a pipeline

679
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,399
whatever then gets some scrap sells it

680
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,799
to a scrap Trader scrap Trader sells it

681
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:16,159
to a steel maker now our technology is

682
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,600
so uh easy to miniaturize actually that

683
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,000
you can actually work only with the

684
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,960
fabricator so you can go to the

685
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,559
fabricator and say hey here's a

686
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,559
technology rolling technology that can

687
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,600
fit in a container if you want and

688
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,600
you'll get your own scrap and then

689
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
process it within your facility to give

690
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,240
back to you to to do the things that to

691
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,600
produce the things that you keep on

692
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,080
producing all the way so I'm not coming

693
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,279
to you to say I have a new material

694
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,000
that's going to be amazing I'm going to

695
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,600
give you your material back and you can

696
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,840
easily test it to see how how good it is

697
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,600
and remember here we are not talking

698
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,960
about airplane engines steel is

699
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,799
beautiful in that sense there are all

700
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,480
these less demanding applications that I

701
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,720
said that I mentioned at the

702
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,559
beginning and finally you might argue

703
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,600
that this kind of approach might not be

704
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,799
impactful um remember we start with some

705
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,799
you know sustainabil this is

706
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,520
sustainability conference after all so

707
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,480
when we put the numbers here so now I'm

708
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,159
showing the same graph i' same plot I've

709
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,720
shown at the beginning I've shown for

710
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,840
hot rolling but now you see it for Cold

711
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,880
Rolling for primary steel making and

712
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,919
secondary steel making and now I show

713
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,600
you the corresponding numbers if you use

714
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,840
solid state process in this scrap metal

715
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,440
consolidation process so you get a

716
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,039
tremendous benefit all in on all these

717
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,960
accounts energy um CO2 emissions water

718
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,880
use and and so forth so these were the

719
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,000
reasons to be skeptical at first I hope

720
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,960
I could convince you that um there are

721
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,399
really not many reasons to be skeptical

722
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,399
I mean if I put my scientist haton I can

723
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:41,559
still find many reasons to be skeptical

724
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,039
but you know we've been in a much better

725
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,559
place than we thought we would be at

726
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,279
this point so with that I would like to

727
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,000
conclude my talk and thank you very much

728
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,760
for your attention um and thanks also

729
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,720
for the researchers who contributed to

730
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,960
this work thank you

731
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,960
[Applause]

732
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,159
and happy to answer questions of

733
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,720
course um so should I be reading this um

734
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,440
what percentage of Steel now is used for

735
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,120
high strength applications or versus low

736
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,519
strength applications such as kitchen

737
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,840
equipment so there are many numbers that

738
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,559
can be thrown here uh but the one number

739
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,840
I remember in this context is that many

740
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,720
of the appliances cover if I'm not

741
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,919
mistaken around 10%

742
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,360
so use of Appliance Steels use for

743
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,360
appliances like dishwashers and

744
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,159
things and then of course um high

745
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,159
strength uh applications fall into many

746
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,840
different categories right so um whether

747
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,080
it's construction or Aerospace or others

748
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,279
um they cover different

749
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,960
percentages are there not many kinds of

750
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,760
Steel with various composition of other

751
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,039
elements is this a logistical challenge

752
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,799
very good question so the question is if

753
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,320
I have different compositions and if I'm

754
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:01,640
sort of combining things together is

755
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,159
this not a problem well remember the

756
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,519
business model there we are working with

757
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,360
one fabricator right the fabricator is

758
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,559
using their own steel the same type of

759
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,480
Steel for the application so for that

760
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:13,559
case the answer is no there's not going

761
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,159
to be big variation well there's going

762
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,559
to be variation within the scatter that

763
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,519
the steel provider originally provides

764
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,559
now what we see independent from that is

765
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,159
that even when there is variation even

766
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,960
when we intentionally create some

767
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,320
compositional variation many of the

768
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,880
formability elements uh formability

769
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,840
behavior is still is still okay unless

770
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,080
you go out of your way to you know add

771
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,080
really problematic elements like

772
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,679
copper thank you very

773
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:49,880
much Professor tson thank you so very

774
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:53,080
much and let's uh make a

775
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,080
Ste thank

776
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,240
you all right and uh

777
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,120
next talk design and computational

778
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,679
strategies for reusable building

779
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,120
components I invite Professor Caitlyn

780
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,399
Miller she's an assistant professor in

781
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,240
the Department of Civil and

782
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:13,519
environmental engineering building

783
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,720
Technology Program where she leads the

784
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:20,760
digital structured research group and

785
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,760
co-directs the structural Design Lab

786
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:28,320
Caitlin great thanks so much for having

787
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,840
me I'm wonderful to be with you at the

788
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,840
end of the day today I'm going to

789
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,519
continue the conversation on circularity

790
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,039
and materials um but focus on a

791
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,279
different application in a different

792
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,679
material stream um I want to start by

793
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,799
acknowledging the team that worked on

794
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,960
this project so um this is a project

795
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,399
that I'll present called pixel frame um

796
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,240
completed by an interdisciplinary team

797
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:49,000
at MIT between architecture Structural

798
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,120
Engineering mechanical design and

799
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,799
computation and it was a project um

800
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,799
funded through the MIT climate and

801
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,600
sustainability Consortium um together

802
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,200
with

803
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,960
wholesome um I'll start by talking about

804
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,960
the built environment which all of you

805
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,360
know well because we all occupy it every

806
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,880
day um buildings and infrastructure

807
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,039
together account for 42% of total

808
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,240
greenhouse gas emissions which is a

809
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,960
staggering number considering how

810
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,279
relatively little attention it often has

811
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,880
in sustainability conversations in

812
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,000
particular within this we often divide

813
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,760
between operational and embodied carbon

814
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,760
emissions and today I'm going to focus

815
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,519
on embodied the the carbon emissions

816
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,799
associated with extracting producing

817
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,840
transporting and assembling materials

818
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,320
into roads Bridges and buildings that

819
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,840
that occupy the entire world what's

820
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,039
really interesting about this within the

821
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,960
embodied emissions which is about 15% of

822
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,080
total greenhouse gas emissions about 8%

823
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,360
are from concrete and cement and another

824
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,760
7% are from steel um today in particular

825
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,159
I'm going to talk about cement and

826
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,000
concrete which is again um one of the

827
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,880
most ubiquitous materials on Earth and

828
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,880
only projected to grow as we saw from

829
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,639
steel similarly because of um rapid

830
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,399
urbanization and um the need for housing

831
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:02,320
around the world um in fact in in a few

832
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,519
years we're projected that um the amount

833
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,519
of concrete on Earth will surpass all of

834
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,200
the biomass on the planet um and what's

835
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,919
interesting about concrete is it's often

836
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,360
used in relatively short life cycles um

837
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,120
typical buildings only lasts for 20 30

838
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,320
years maximum up to 50 years maybe um

839
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,840
and the the end of life streams for them

840
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,679
are not very um there there aren't a lot

841
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,360
of good end of life life uses for them

842
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,480
they're typically either used either go

843
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,679
to landfill or they're used for back

844
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,679
there's a very tiny amount currently of

845
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,840
post um demolition concrete that is

846
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,399
recycled as aggregate but that's

847
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,399
considered down cycling because it's a

848
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,840
substantial degradation of the strength

849
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,919
in the original material in fact about

850
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,720
half of all of the concrete that we have

851
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:49,480
demand for globally on an annual basis

852
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,720
um by mass is demolished every year um

853
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,519
and often times the demolished concrete

854
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,080
um is functionally um still viable so

855
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:58,080
we're demolishing concrete not because

856
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,559
it's lost strength or it's no longer are

857
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,120
safe but because our demand for

858
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,559
buildings and infrastructure changes

859
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,120
over time in fact we anticipate that the

860
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,480
built environment will need to adapt and

861
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,519
change much more frequently in the

862
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,200
coming years um all this leads to a lot

863
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,200
of different possible solutions for

864
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,760
decarbonizing the Concrete Construction

865
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,039
sector we hear a lot about um so-called

866
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,480
production side um reduction strategies

867
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,799
so things like um changing the fuel

868
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,480
source to make cement using alternative

869
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,440
materials instead of cement um embedding

870
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,000
carbon or other materials that capture

871
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,639
car CO2 directly into concrete um and

872
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,240
these are all really exciting but a lot

873
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:34,919
of them are far away from large scale

874
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,080
application and require quite a lot of

875
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,519
investment and um large scale technology

876
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,320
changes to be deployed um I'm going to

877
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,720
instead Focus today on two um

878
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,320
alternative Pathways that are more on

879
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,240
the downstream demand side one is

880
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,600
efficiency based and the other is

881
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,639
looking at circularity through um

882
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,159
component

883
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:55,639
reuse efficiency has been along for a

884
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,240
around for a very long time um in most

885
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:59,840
Concrete Construction today we use far

886
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,320
more material than is structurally

887
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,519
mechanically necessary because um our

888
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,240
standards have evolved to prioritize

889
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,280
Simplicity in construction and a lot of

890
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,879
this is around sort of 20th Century

891
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,960
Technologies about what is easy to build

892
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,399
um if instead we look to how we could

893
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,359
remove material that is structurally

894
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,119
unnecessary we see substantial

895
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:21,399
reductions this is some from some of my

896
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,960
previous research showing that 50 60 70%

897
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:24,960
of the embodied carbon in Concrete

898
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,200
Construction in ubiquitous systems like

899
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,240
beams and slabs and Frames can be

900
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,320
removed just by removing unnecessary

901
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,679
structural

902
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,000
material we also have the potential to

903
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,040
reuse um structural material at various

904
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,040
scales all the way on the right we have

905
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,119
adaptive reuse that's the idea that a

906
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,679
whole building should be reused um for a

907
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,359
new purpose um and that's ideally the

908
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,839
most impactful but also the hardest to

909
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,320
implement at scale because many

910
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,359
buildings functionally need to change

911
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,240
over time all the way on um the left we

912
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,359
have down cycling so taking concrete

913
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,280
crushing it up and using it as aggregate

914
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,240
as I said that's a severe loss of value

915
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,079
and the value chain so while it's easy

916
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,119
to do it doesn't make a lot of sense

917
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,200
either from an economic or environmental

918
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,200
perspective I'm going to focus on in the

919
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,079
middle on on modular reuse and whole

920
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,320
element reuse and in particular I'm

921
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,800
going to tell you about a system that

922
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,119
we've developed that is a new pre-cast

923
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,920
concrete system made out of flexible

924
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,160
modules that can be taken apart and

925
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,359
reassembled into many um a wide variety

926
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,440
of um building structural systems um so

927
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,320
this is a system made out of individual

928
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,320
pre-cast concrete Parts called pixels

929
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,720
they're um they're geometrically

930
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,920
identical but have varying strengths

931
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,520
they are dry jointed and post tension

932
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,520
together with a recyclable steel system

933
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,400
that allows them to um create many

934
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,480
different spans with many different

935
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,119
capacities in many different

936
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,240
configurations um and are able to be

937
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,160
taken apart and reassembled many times

938
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,000
without

939
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,960
damage um this system is mostly a

940
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,480
functional system but as we've developed

941
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,040
it we've also thought about this as a

942
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,200
sort of Aesthetics and sort of marketing

943
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,040
exercise so part of this is about

944
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,760
changing the dynamic culturally about

945
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,359
how we see reuse in society so that

946
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,040
things that are treated as garbage like

947
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,000
concrete which is sent to the landfill

948
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,680
typically could instead really become a

949
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,880
valued asset that makes sense to take

950
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,119
care of keep track of and use and reuse

951
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,319
many

952
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,599
times the system is meant to balance

953
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:23,400
efficiency UPF front so it uses a very

954
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,520
smart cross-section that uses way less

955
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,000
concrete than a typical rectangular beam

956
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,880
and a post tensioning system that

957
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,520
allocates tension and compression in an

958
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,599
optimal configuration with modularity so

959
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,720
a typical shape optimized beam would be

960
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,000
really customized for every application

961
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,440
here we want to develop something that's

962
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,040
modular that can be used in many cases

963
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,319
and we wanted to develop a system that

964
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,400
had a lot of adaptability so there's a

965
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:46,960
small component size unlike a lot of

966
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,359
kind of kits of parts for buildings with

967
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,040
whole beams and columns here the small

968
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,760
unit size allows for many different

969
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,760
geometric configurations so you could

970
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,440
create houses schools commercial

971
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,440
buildings hospitals all with the same

972
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,400
kit of parts

973
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,400
um a lot of the Ingenuity of this comes

974
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,280
from the variation of strengths that we

975
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,240
allocate to different pixels so those of

976
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,960
you who are new to concrete and cement

977
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,839
the amount of cement in the concrete

978
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,119
determines both its carbon content and

979
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:15,319
its strength so higher strength concrete

980
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,000
is great because it allows you to use

981
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:19,599
less material but it also has a much

982
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,040
higher carbon intensity per unit um per

983
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,839
unit Mass so here we're creating this

984
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,440
pallet of pixel strength so that we only

985
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,200
use high carbon high strength elements

986
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,720
where they're structurally necessary but

987
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,319
they also fit together geometrically

988
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,640
because they have the same overall shape

989
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,440
and then they're all dry jointed

990
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,200
together into this um steel post tension

991
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,680
system um all the P pieces connect

992
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,280
together um with this non-structural

993
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,240
core that allows them to slide together

994
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,240
um and allows them to achieve many

995
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,680
different capacities this was a really

996
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,119
challenging problem to design this

997
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,119
system because most engineers and

998
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,440
Architects are designing oneoff products

999
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,000
over and over and over again each

1000
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,760
building is different every structure

1001
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,280
has different requirements here we

1002
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,440
developed an ALG mic process to um

1003
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,119
anticipate thousands and millions of

1004
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,640
buildings in the future all of the

1005
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,680
possible scenarios and loadings and uh

1006
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,560
structural challenges they might undergo

1007
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,680
and we designed our system in a data

1008
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,480
Centric way to respond to that cluster

1009
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,680
of possible buildings rather than a

1010
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,200
single um instance um we nevertheless

1011
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,680
also designed it to meet building code

1012
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,960
today so we're making use of

1013
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,720
Technologies and knowledge that is

1014
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,040
already well established in the building

1015
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,640
sector um this is a life cycle

1016
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,000
assessment showing the pixel frame

1017
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,000
system compared to um traditional

1018
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,119
reinforced concrete so as you can see RC

1019
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,119
stands for reinforced concrete the the

1020
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,040
pixel frame system UPF front so this is

1021
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,160
not considering circularity just A1

1022
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,319
through A3 Cradle to gate emissions is

1023
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,960
um dramatically reduced compared to

1024
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:47,160
concrete the reinforced concrete and

1025
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,880
that's because of the more intelligent

1026
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,160
cross-section so just by having a

1027
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,480
smarter shape and a better allocation of

1028
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,160
strength where we're only using high

1029
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,720
strength where it's necessary we can

1030
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,480
achieve a lot up front and that not only

1031
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,480
Compares well to concrete it compares

1032
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,960
well to all other structural systems

1033
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,000
that are on the market today so even

1034
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,160
things like Mass Timber which g a lot of

1035
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,400
attention for being very low carbon but

1036
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,119
come at a cost premium the pixel frame

1037
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,079
system is competitive in terms of carbon

1038
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,000
with that um when we consider reuse or

1039
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,680
second life um the savings are are more

1040
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,359
significant so we can reduce the savings

1041
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,160
by another 50% by reusing the pixel

1042
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,240
elements all of the concrete parts are

1043
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,480
designed to be reused many times and the

1044
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,000
metal parts are designed to be recycled

1045
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,960
we've also developed an algorithmic

1046
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,760
process for designing buildings with the

1047
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,000
pixel frame system so normally design is

1048
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,359
a fairly um traditional process an

1049
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,079
architect and engineer draws a design

1050
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,520
does the calculations figures out what

1051
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,640
material is needed and asks the

1052
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,359
contractor to build it here we have an

1053
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,880
inventory Centric um process in which we

1054
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:49,960
have a set of material and we need to

1055
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,920
figure out how we can use that to make

1056
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,880
any kind of building we want to solve

1057
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,920
that problem we've um leveraged an

1058
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,000
algorithmic um assignment workflow that

1059
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,520
has a digital twin of our inventory and

1060
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,920
a and a design that the building owner

1061
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,720
or architect is is interested in and

1062
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,480
automatically figures out which pixels

1063
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,480
in the inventory should go where um in

1064
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,960
the design and here you see we're also

1065
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,720
saying sometimes we might need to add a

1066
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,200
new pixel to this design so those are

1067
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,920
colored

1068
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,440
pink um we're also thinking quite a lot

1069
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,119
about how to manage this inventory this

1070
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,599
is again very different from traditional

1071
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,160
construction suddenly we need to keep

1072
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,760
track of all of these assets in a

1073
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,599
building there's a lot of thinking about

1074
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,440
this in the circularity world um the

1075
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,960
idea of material passports um promotes

1076
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,440
creating a digital inventory or a

1077
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,680
digital twin of all your pieces that are

1078
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,720
linked physically to objects through

1079
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,800
some kind of um RFID or other kind of

1080
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,640
code this is just a quick example of a

1081
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,800
material passport that we created for

1082
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,319
the pixel frame system where one pixel

1083
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,079
was cast about two years ago it then got

1084
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:49,480
assembled into a large- scale beam that

1085
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:51,760
was structurally tested for our research

1086
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,480
it was then disassembled um so that we

1087
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,160
could use it for something else that

1088
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,640
same pixel became part of a new

1089
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,920
demonstrator structure for an exhibition

1090
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,119
where it was packaged and transported um

1091
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,280
from MIT to Washington DC to be part of

1092
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,079
an exhibit we kept track of that same

1093
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,079
pixel on its way back where it was used

1094
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,119
again for another structural test here

1095
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,160
testing the sheer capacity of the system

1096
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,079
where we finally um tested it on purpose

1097
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,319
to failure and we retired the system

1098
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,319
from the inventory we can repeat this

1099
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,160
process at scale um here's a digital

1100
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,200
representation of a larger inventory

1101
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,240
that we've simulated where the same

1102
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,440
pixels could for example become part of

1103
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,000
a warehouse structure that has perhaps a

1104
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,760
shorter life cycle

1105
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,680
the same Parts could be taken apart and

1106
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,880
reassembled into a cultural space like a

1107
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,880
museum exhibition or Pavilion and then

1108
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,760
again used even in an Adaptive reuse

1109
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,240
setting here we imagined a large um

1110
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,480
existing structural core where we've

1111
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,240
designed an office frame around it to

1112
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,800
make use of some existing

1113
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,240
resources um with that I'll I'll end I

1114
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,079
want to thank again the team and say

1115
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,640
that the pixel frame system um started

1116
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,079
as a research project but is now um um

1117
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,319
in the fledgling stages of

1118
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,119
commercialization so so these two former

1119
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,480
students are co- founders of the pixel

1120
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:02,280
frame company um which was recently

1121
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,680
funded by the Massachusetts clean energy

1122
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,800
center and they'd be very happy to talk

1123
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,180
to you more if you're interested in

1124
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,640
testing the system thank

1125
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,640
[Applause]

1126
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,599
you yep um is steel corrosion a risk due

1127
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,280
to the joints do the joints need to be

1128
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:24,319
sealed I mean we're we're imagining this

1129
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,000
in indoor applications where steel is is

1130
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,480
widely used already so we're not

1131
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,839
proposing um a change to Steel we if

1132
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,520
necessary we could either we could use

1133
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,119
various um corrosion or fire protection

1134
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,640
systems for the steel like intumescent

1135
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,599
pain or other protect protective um uh

1136
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,480
finishes but we're we're imagining using

1137
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,200
steel as it already is very widely used

1138
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,200
in post engined

1139
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,720
applications yeah um this solution

1140
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,319
definitely is a change to status quo

1141
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,000
labor um our partners at holom are

1142
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,200
actually really excited about the fact

1143
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,040
that this is a much faster assembly

1144
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,359
sequence so these individual Parts could

1145
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,760
be assembled into beams and columns

1146
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,480
offsite in a in a factory transported to

1147
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,160
site and then assembled much much more

1148
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,440
quickly than traditional reinforced

1149
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,760
concrete ready mix construction cast in

1150
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,640
place where um the setup time of the

1151
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,839
concrete is a big um is a big sort of

1152
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,400
pressure point in construction

1153
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,599
sequencing here um these parts could be

1154
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,640
because they're pre-cast and they're

1155
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,559
already at full strength all the parts

1156
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,599
could be assembled um much more quickly

1157
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:29,119
with a lighter crew similar to how steel

1158
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,119
and mass Timber is assembled today

1159
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,679
thank

1160
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,679
[Applause]

1161
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:44,119
you all right and the last uh talk of

1162
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,200
the day the last lightening

1163
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:51,160
talk uh I invite uh San deep biswas a

1164
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,280
young researcher to talk about

1165
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,119
sustainable Transportation low carbon

1166
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,359
Trucking s d perceived his Masters in

1167
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,520
chemical engineering from MIT last year

1168
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:05,319
he's currently a PhD candidate under the

1169
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,319
supervision professor professor William

1170
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:08,319
Grim

1171
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,680
[Applause]

1172
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,160
DP thank you so much for the invite and

1173
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,200
the uh intro there so yeah I'm shy deep

1174
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,760
I'm a graduate student uh working with

1175
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,880
Professor William green and today I'll

1176
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,880
be sharing a little bit about uh the

1177
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,480
onboard dehydrogen ation based loc power

1178
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,760
train that we are developing for

1179
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,800
decarbonizing long hold Trucking the the

1180
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,000
title can be a mouthful but I'll try to

1181
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,720
sort of break it up into uh more

1182
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
digestible pieces so the way of sort of

1183
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,760
structured the talk is that we'll we'll

1184
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,280
sort of start with why is Trucking sort

1185
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,839
of a problem and what's the motivation

1186
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,079
for this uh for this re research in the

1187
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:51,720
first place I'll talk a little bit about

1188
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,119
what the existing uh Solutions are and

1189
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,079
why they don't really fit the tring

1190
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,119
space we'll talk about potentially uh

1191
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,000
promising fuel options for the trucking

1192
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,119
space but then again sort of discuss

1193
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,319
where this technological uh barrier is

1194
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:05,760
that we're trying to solve I'll also be

1195
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,720
talking a little bit about the

1196
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,400
technoeconomic assessments and and what

1197
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,079
sort of um you know like what what is

1198
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,280
sort of the cost penalty for some of

1199
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,960
these decarbonizing efforts and also

1200
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,000
share with you guys uh what sort of

1201
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,480
technical progress we have made and

1202
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,640
where we are on that technology

1203
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,680
Readiness scale uh kind of thinking

1204
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,800
forward into commercializing this

1205
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:28,079
technology as well so with that uh let's

1206
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,000
kind of just look at the some of the U

1207
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,640
numbers that that you know describe

1208
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,440
Trucking today it's 7.1% of the annual

1209
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,160
emissions so that's that's a pretty non-

1210
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,920
negligible amount and I think something

1211
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,920
that's more concerning is that when you

1212
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,400
look at the look at the projected

1213
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,119
Freight emissions It's actually an

1214
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,880
upward Trend uh even by 2030 so instead

1215
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,160
of going downstairs we're going to kind

1216
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,119
of just keep we keep going up uh So

1217
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,400
within the group we have kind of looked

1218
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,040
very holistically at this problem so we

1219
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,760
have kind of done technoeconomic studies

1220
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,960
that look at um you know biofuels that

1221
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,760
look at um battery electric options and

1222
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,280
obviously conventional hydrogen options

1223
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,640
that sort of include compressed and

1224
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,599
liquified hydrogen I think one thing

1225
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,920
that sort of keeps coming back is that

1226
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,319
you you sort of see that there's this

1227
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,400
massive cost penalty uh where it's like

1228
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:17,319
more than two times uh expensive and

1229
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,359
then even when you go all the way up to

1230
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:22,640
2050 some of these options seem seem

1231
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:24,599
quite pricey and trucking is sort of a

1232
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,359
low margin business so you really do not

1233
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,880
have that much um of a you know that of

1234
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,400
that comfort that you can just um

1235
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,559
increase the prices and everybody sort

1236
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,599
of feels the the from the increase of

1237
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,400
you know Trucking prices um so what we

1238
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,359
sort of found from these technoeconomic

1239
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,000
analyses was that hydrogen was a

1240
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:45,079
promising option uh but what really

1241
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,839
kills it is the fact that delivery of

1242
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,599
hydrogen is super expensive so this is

1243
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,839
where you can sort of look at different

1244
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,200
options such as loc's that are liquid

1245
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,800
organic hydrogen carriers so very

1246
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,040
quickly to describe them they're these

1247
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,559
organic molecules that can be reversibly

1248
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,520
hydrogenated and dehydrogenated so you

1249
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,160
can sort of um imagine that wherever

1250
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,000
you're making hydrogen you perform the

1251
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,839
hydrogenation Reaction store it in the

1252
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,280
molecule now it's a room temperature

1253
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,240
liquid which is easy to transport and

1254
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,400
then as in when you use it you sort of

1255
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,520
release it uh by heating it up in that

1256
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,720
endo endothermic dehydrogenation process

1257
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,119
uh the big big advantages of of loc's is

1258
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,440
the fact that you know they're room

1259
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,319
temperature liquid fuel so they

1260
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,680
integrate well with our existing fuel

1261
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:29,559
distribution infrastructure uh there's

1262
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,400
very little additional safety concerns

1263
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,000
very similar physiochemical properties

1264
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,680
to existing liquid Fields like diesel uh

1265
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,040
this is particularly important you know

1266
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,599
considering these compared to like

1267
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,319
ammonia for example which has the

1268
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,119
toxicity issue the other thing is also

1269
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:44,920
like it's commercially produced so when

1270
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,960
you're kind of looking at applications

1271
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,079
such as fuels uh you really kind of have

1272
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,920
to think about can you get these

1273
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,640
molecules at the scale that you need so

1274
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:57,119
for Locs that's a yes um but if you look

1275
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,839
at what existing Loc distrib ution

1276
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,119
supply chain looks like and how people

1277
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:03,599
imagine powering trucks with it you kind

1278
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,800
of end up with this situation where you

1279
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,240
have the dehydrogenation happening at

1280
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,520
the gas station uh and then you take the

1281
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,400
hydrogen that comes off of your off of

1282
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,880
your um sort of hydrogen release unit

1283
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,720
you compress it again to 700 bars put it

1284
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,480
on trucks that have to like travel like

1285
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,800
600 miles a day that's kind of Long Haul

1286
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,920
Trucking and the issue is the

1287
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,680
dehydrogenation requires you to burn

1288
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,160
sort of 30% of the hydrogen that you

1289
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,160
release just to keep it going it Al the

1290
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,480
compression is super energy intensive

1291
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:35,319
that's another 20 30% of the of the uh

1292
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,480
you know energy intensity and then also

1293
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:39,720
the fact that there is um there is sort

1294
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,079
of this capital investment to convert

1295
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,079
every existing gas station to be able to

1296
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,040
deliver hydrogen that becomes more than

1297
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,000
a million dollar investment and a pretty

1298
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,839
difficult proposition in that regard so

1299
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,920
effectively yeah from the OPC side the

1300
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:54,920
supply chain is quite inefficient where

1301
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,240
roughly 60% of the hydrogen is lost

1302
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,839
before it actually makes it to the

1303
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,240
engine or the fuel cell on the truck and

1304
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:02,760
there is the capex limitation as well

1305
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,520
also if you kind of look at it from the

1306
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,280
emissions perspective given the fact

1307
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,280
that we are so inefficient with the

1308
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,880
hydrogen Supply if you're looking at

1309
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,040
sort of the emissions of blue hydrogen

1310
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,599
and the fact that you know when you're

1311
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,040
running this compressor at a gas station

1312
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,359
you're probably connected to the grid

1313
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,920
which is also not clean you you realize

1314
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,480
that this whole supply chain would have

1315
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,160
minimal emission savings when you

1316
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,480
compare it to diesel so how do we sort

1317
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,720
of come in and fix this from a technical

1318
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,680
perspective and for for us the idea is

1319
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,280
to do this onboard dehydrogenation

1320
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,400
scheme where the idea is now you load

1321
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,280
your truck with this liquid instead of

1322
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,280
like hydrogen gas so loading it with

1323
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,599
liquid immediately takes carees of the

1324
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,440
fact that the refueling station no

1325
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:43,319
longer has to change how it currently

1326
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,559
conducts business uh the other thing is

1327
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:47,440
the Lo's do have sufficient volumetric

1328
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:49,200
energy density so there's no range

1329
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,960
anxiety or issues you can kind of have

1330
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,839
the same as what diesel has uh the other

1331
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,880
benefit we sort of get is the exhaust

1332
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,680
heat now that comes from your internal

1333
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,480
combustion engine or fuel cell you can

1334
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,319
sort of think of using that to power

1335
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,240
some of the dehydrogenation so you have

1336
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:06,520
heat integration in that situation and

1337
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,920
finally hydrogen can be generated at

1338
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,319
sort of the necessary pressures for the

1339
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,079
applications in ic engines or or fuel

1340
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:15,200
cells so the compression cost has

1341
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,319
completely been eliminated so all of

1342
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,520
this together kind of really hits the

1343
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:21,760
pain points of compression and and the

1344
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,559
heat that needs to be provided this is

1345
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,319
kind of a quick schematic of what we

1346
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,400
envision the powertrain to be obviously

1347
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:29,119
there's a lot more complexity

1348
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,280
going on but the main idea sort of being

1349
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,880
is you have your loc tank you heat it up

1350
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,799
you send it to the reactor where the

1351
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,559
dehydrogenation happens then you have

1352
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:40,319
the separation train where you separate

1353
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,880
out the hydrogen and the loc the the

1354
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,920
lean loc goes back sort of to another

1355
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,960
storage tank and your hydrogen sort of

1356
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,520
keeps moving forward goes through your

1357
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,040
engine and then you have sort of the

1358
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,599
secondary burner which is sort of

1359
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,040
important because 100% integration is

1360
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,720
not possible you still need to burn a

1361
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,559
little bit of hydrogen I'll talk to a

1362
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,680
little bit about what what percentage of

1363
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,880
that that we burn and what efficiencies

1364
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,280
we're getting but effectively the idea

1365
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,960
is by doing this on the truck you're

1366
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,680
getting sort of the um savings from from

1367
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,559
the heat integration and elimination of

1368
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,280
compression also just to point out you

1369
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,559
know for a schematic this is this has

1370
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,720
been enlarge but in a real truck this is

1371
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,839
really just 20 fet cubed worth of space

1372
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,119
so you're really not taking out a lot of

1373
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:23,240
payload or or or actually not really

1374
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,440
affecting payload at all in in this in

1375
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,760
this

1376
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,920
situation um let's kind of quickly look

1377
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,720
at the technoeconomic results that sort

1378
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,079
of Feed in from the technical efficacy

1379
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,720
as well so with the new proposed power

1380
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:37,799
train what we sort of see is the the

1381
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,480
Opex that uh that we sort of get from

1382
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:42,520
Fuel and efficiencies the 40% delivery

1383
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,839
efficiency can go all the way up to 80

1384
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,760
87% so that's a that's a big massive

1385
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:50,079
saving there uh additionally given that

1386
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,400
loc's offer one to1 replacement to

1387
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,920
diesel trucks this kind of comes from

1388
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,920
like you're not really adding a lot of

1389
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,760
weight with the L the main weight is the

1390
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,480
fact that the fuel is not as

1391
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,079
gravimetrically energy dense as diesel

1392
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,359
so you put more fuel fuel on board you

1393
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,680
kind of have to look at this hybrid

1394
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:05,559
system so you have some batteries and

1395
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,480
the reactor system but effectively all

1396
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:10,280
of that barely adds any additional

1397
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,359
weight it's about like 3,000 to 4,000 lb

1398
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,400
for a truck that can weigh up to 80,000

1399
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:16,720
other analysis shows that uh it's a

1400
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,839
pretty minimal increase so when you kind

1401
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,680
of put all of these numbers in the main

1402
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,520
uh output is like when you're when

1403
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,440
you're looking at you know a hydrogen

1404
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,520
price of $2 a kilogram which is

1405
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,599
something that is reasonable for blue

1406
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,119
hydrogen today you sort of see that

1407
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,200
you're getting sort of in that 18% more

1408
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,160
expensive than the 2019 diesel Baseline

1409
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,839
but given the sort of the volatility of

1410
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,079
diesel prices that we have seen it's

1411
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,359
very much within that range where you

1412
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:44,160
can say it's compartible and you're also

1413
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,799
getting sort of a 71% reduction in in

1414
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,880
emissions so pretty big emission

1415
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:51,520
reduction for what is a pretty minor or

1416
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,440
almost no um cost penalty in that in

1417
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,160
that regard and you know the other thing

1418
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,200
is uh the prices of hydrogen are only

1419
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,000
prod directed to sort of go down so if

1420
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,680
this technology were to uh exist in a

1421
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,079
commercial scale you can sort of think

1422
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,200
that Trucking could be uh decarbonized

1423
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:08,920
in a very competitive fashion the other

1424
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,240
big thing to point out is the additional

1425
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,599
Capital cost on a truck especially when

1426
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,599
we running with hydrogen combustion

1427
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:17,160
engine is only 30 to 40,000 extra and

1428
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,599
this is quite important because you know

1429
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,480
if you're looking at some of the battery

1430
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,480
electric or the fuel cell based option

1431
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,960
that people are looking at uh those

1432
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,480
trucks are immensely expensive and that

1433
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,200
cap capital really really uh messes up

1434
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,000
the economics as well uh one thing to

1435
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,760
definitely point out is we use a

1436
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,040
platinum Catalyst for this reaction

1437
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,240
which is kind of the primary reason for

1438
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,359
that extra capex which is $10,000 um for

1439
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,160
every truck but the big thing is there

1440
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,680
are there's a lot of research going on

1441
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,440
to sort of replace that with Earth

1442
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,200
abundant metals and further bring that

1443
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,000
price down uh so even sort of with the

1444
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,599
with the economics sort of what we see

1445
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,400
here one of the big things with um with

1446
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,400
sort of the you know the system is like

1447
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,880
the fuel delivery is still 30% that's

1448
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,000
because you're still moving a lot of uh

1449
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,240
loc it's like almost five times as much

1450
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,920
um compared to the diesel and that

1451
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,440
accounts for 30% of the cost but there

1452
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,280
are different ways in which we are

1453
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,280
looking at potentially reducing that

1454
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,839
factor as well so this is all fun and

1455
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,880
great but you know like where are we

1456
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:19,280
with the with the system yeah um so I

1457
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,839
I'll probably skip this a little bit

1458
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,280
because of the time but I'll quickly

1459
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:25,119
present sort of like the main um thing

1460
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,400
as well here so where we are currently

1461
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,319
sitting is we have a 10 kilowatt reactor

1462
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,440
that we have already built uh for this

1463
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,079
system in in the lab and we are

1464
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,480
currently testing sort of this pilot

1465
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,640
scale system which is about on10th the

1466
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,480
size of the entire truck and currently

1467
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:45,079
we are working to purchase modify and

1468
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,040
engine uh to run it on with with

1469
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:49,559
hydrogen that we will um sort of that we

1470
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,200
will sort of integrate with the rest of

1471
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:53,359
the system kind of looking at um you

1472
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,760
know that's something that we're

1473
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,599
expecting to demonstrate by May 2025 and

1474
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,280
that would be the first time that a you

1475
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,400
know like a fully integrated system has

1476
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,599
been demonstrated and we really hoping

1477
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,480
that that would be sufficient um you

1478
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,280
know like technology demonstration for

1479
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,480
oems to sort of also collaborate and

1480
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,559
really really pick up the technology so

1481
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,400
with that I'll just uh like to thank

1482
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:16,119
everybody for being here and happy to

1483
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,960
happy to take questions so I do see some

1484
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,400
of those so I can maybe start with one

1485
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,039
of the first ones rehydrogenation either

1486
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,160
in the vehicle or the station without

1487
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:26,640
needing yeah so this is something so the

1488
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,240
same Catalyst can be used for for the

1489
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,200
hydrogenation as well it just so happens

1490
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,680
that you know if you are transporting it

1491
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,520
as the loc you really do not want to

1492
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,960
remove the hydrogen and and sort of put

1493
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,200
it back so you want to keep keep it as

1494
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,640
the loc from wherever your hydrogen

1495
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,000
generation is uh so that's why the the

1496
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,920
idea of like okay maybe I put compressed

1497
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,359
hydrogen and then use that to sort of um

1498
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,280
charge my loc it's possible but um that

1499
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,520
particular um situation is actually less

1500
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,480
cost competitive than what we propos

1501
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,240
where you just sort of send the loc back

1502
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,520
because the uh the current trucks you

1503
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,440
know that would deliver the loc uh still

1504
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,760
have to go back sort of empty so you can

1505
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,599
sort of send the the spent Lo back with

1506
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,839
that doesn't really add too much to the

1507
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:16,079
to the cost there um is the loc system

1508
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:18,920
scalable yes so we are just to kind of

1509
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,839
understand um I'm not sure if are you

1510
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,359
talking about the supply chain system or

1511
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:25,280
or maybe the um you know like the the

1512
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:27,920
powertrain system so maybe I'll take the

1513
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,640
question as is it aable on the on the

1514
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,000
truck itself like to the truck itself so

1515
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,119
we we sort of definitely feel that we

1516
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,720
can get it to the scale of 100 to 150

1517
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,200
kilow which is the amount of power

1518
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,599
that's needed for for a truck uh the

1519
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,520
additional thing is you know something

1520
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,000
that I skipped is we are currently in

1521
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,920
talks with a lot of people oems in the

1522
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,039
in the Marine space in the locomotive

1523
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,440
space and those would be systems that

1524
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:56,039
are significantly larger uh it's still a

1525
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,920
little um it's still a little too far

1526
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:59,319
away way to say definitely like what the

1527
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,960
transients and things would look like

1528
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:04,200
for the big big systems but um it is

1529
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,880
something we we definitely feel as an is

1530
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,400
an opportunity to to sort of explore and

1531
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,839
more scientific work kind of has to be

1532
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,760
done in that that space to figure out

1533
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:15,119
how how large we can we can go on um on

1534
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,720
you know like the ships or or the

1535
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,640
locomotive there but there's definitely

1536
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,880
opportunity there so I guess yeah with

1537
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,119
that I think that's my time so I'm still

1538
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,520
uh going to be sticking around so if

1539
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:28,160
there's any more questions happy to

1540
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,160
happy to uh take them as well thank you

1541
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:33,760
thanks sh thank you so much
