1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm uh you know it's a pleasure to be

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,720
here today to to talk to all of you uh

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,679
about some of the work that I've done in

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,960
the Boyer lab um on you know fluoresence

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,240
microscopy so I want to start out with

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,160
uh a pretty simple claim that microscopy

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,320
is a very important tool in cell biology

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,119
in particular there are two things that

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
I think microscopy does really well um

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,000
the first is it gives us information

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,000
about morphology of cells and organel

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm showing you here a couple of um

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,040
there's two screens a couple of uh

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,239
cardom myosite nuclei that tend to have

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,559
pretty interesting morphologies and I'll

16
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,520
uh I'll get back to that a little bit

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,960
later and then I'm showing you um some

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
other work on the on the right that

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,199
we're working on in the Boer lab um we

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,039
work with a a putative mitochondrial

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,520
protein and using microscopy we were

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
able to show that it has some some sort

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,680
of unique spatial relationships with

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
with mitochondria and so that's really

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,160
the other thing um is is spatial

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,600
relationships or something that we can

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,559
get really nice information about with

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,080
microscopy now if we look at the

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,759
microscopy Market landscape it's it's

30
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,680
really diverged into high content uh

31
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,080
machines um like the the Perkin Elmer um

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,159
Opera Phoenix that I use um and and

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,439
other sort of super resolution machines

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,640
that are developed by uh a bunch of

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,079
companies and I want to take a second to

36
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,640
um try and espouse the value of super

37
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,680
resolution microscopy to you guys so I'm

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,200
showing you here a couple of cells that

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
are staying for a structural protein

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,240
called alpat tub ul and in a in a high

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,920
content High throughput microscopy

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,600
system um this is about the resolution

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,720
that you can get um and and when we

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,960
apply super resolution to this image we

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,159
can really start to pick apart the

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,960
individual fibers in these cells in a

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,840
way that can allow us to ask pretty

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,159
interesting questions so we think that

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,200
that you know higher resolution

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
microscopy is really important in cell

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,759
biology and I don't think I need to um

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,360
convince this audience that high content

53
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,560
or high throughput microscopy is also

54
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,520
super important so in the bo we kind of

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
asked if we could come up with a

56
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,880
compromise between these two

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
camps and in thinking about that we came

58
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,360
across a technology that was developed

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,599
in Ed boyden's lab in 2015 called

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,160
expansion microscopy if you're not

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,720
familiar expansion microscopy is a a

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,959
super resolution microscopy technique

63
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,160
that works by um uh having doing

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,959
something on the sample rather than

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,519
changing the microscope and so to be a

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,560
little bit more specific we'll do the

67
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,280
the standard fixation and uh imuno

68
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,360
stating protocol and then we'll um add

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,080
an anchor molecule into the cells that's

70
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,640
going to uh coent bind to proteins we'll

71
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:47,360
peruse in uh a mono uh sorry

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,920
uh um uh a monomer solution that uh we

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,800
can then polymerize to form a hydrogel

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,760
that sort of incorporates the anchored

75
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,800
proteins in the sample after we digest

76
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,560
the the cells we can add water and the

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,879
the gel will essentially swell

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,040
um and it'll bring the fluorescent

79
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,000
molecules with it and and the the

80
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,519
outcome of that is essentially larger

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,120
cells a larger sample that we can image

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,640
at effectively a higher resolution and

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
so you can see this process happening on

84
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,159
some cells that are staying for that

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,519
that structural protein off a tubulin

86
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,319
here and you can see they're kind of

87
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,760
expanding up to the right um in this

88
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,440
little

89
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,360
video uh

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,120
so we this this technology was developed

91
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,920
like I said in 2015 um and it's been

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,080
used since then in hundreds of papers by

93
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,319
uh a large number of of labs across the

94
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,040
world um but the implementation has

95
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,120
pretty much always been uh sort of

96
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,159
handheld very meticulous sample by

97
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,439
sample so we wanted to take this core

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,959
technology and adapt it to 96 well

99
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,879
plates in a manner that would be

100
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,799
conducive to high content Imaging and

101
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,000
what we came up with was this this

102
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,640
device we call the high XM device it's a

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,840
simple plastic wellplate insert that

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
works by essentially collecting small

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,040
volumes of the hydrogel solution and

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
depositing them into the well plates in

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,760
a in a manner that's conducive to uh the

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,280
expansion microscopy and so in this

109
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,319
first step we're collecting small

110
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,040
volumes of the gel basically just by

111
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
dipping the device into a

112
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,959
reservoir this this collection process

113
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,280
is mediated by uh geometry on the

114
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,400
surface of these tips after which we can

115
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
take the loaded device insert it into

116
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,120
the wells of the well plate where the

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,400
gels will be

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
deposited uh on the cell culture surface

119
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,080
where we have our fixed and stained

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,120
cells um we then polymerize with

121
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,880
ultraviolet light and we have this gel

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,479
that has U sort of a doughnut shape uh

123
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,320
which means that we can add our digest

124
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,840
out our water to the well while the

125
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,800
device is still there um the gel will

126
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,759
swell and it will effectively remove

127
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,240
itself from the device after which we

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
can remove the device from the well

129
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,039
plate and go to image without ripping

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,320
the gels out of the well

131
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,400
plate um and so we're able to use this

132
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,320
device and

133
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,840
form uh you know these these gels in

134
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,520
these Wells and mass in 96 well plates

135
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,880
and we can take those samples and bring

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,560
them to a high content Imaging system we

137
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,360
use um the Opera Phoenix uh one of the

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,039
oper phoenixes at the broad

139
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,400
Institute um and we can generate you

140
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,560
know essentially terabytes of data from

141
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,120
uh super resolution samples quote

142
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,759
unquote um without really too much

143
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,360
effort um and I want to take a moment to

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
uh uh kind of address one of the most

145
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,960
common questions that we get about

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,160
Manion microscopy particularly in this

147
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,759
context which is how do you know after

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,800
the thing is blown up that it's a

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,360
faithful recapitulation of what the cell

150
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,800
originally was um and and in order to

151
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,360
answer that question um we had to do a

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,319
ton of validation work that basically

153
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,039
involves taking images of the same cells

154
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,199
before and after expanding them finding

155
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,840
those images where you have the exact

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
same cell and then putting those images

157
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,919
into register and doing some relatively

158
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,039
complicated math to to come up with a a

159
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,919
deformation Vector field and I'll spare

160
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,840
you on the details of that except to say

161
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,319
that the the data that we produced from

162
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,319
that was on par with uh previous

163
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,120
expansion microscopy uh Publications so

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,520
that was kind of what we were looking

165
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,160
for so so you know having kind of shown

166
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,560
you the technology that we've developed

167
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,280
we think that this this High exm device

168
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,759
is potentially widely applicable in the

169
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,680
academic pharmaceutical and biotech

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,599
sectors but to give you uh a couple of

171
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,000
examples um I'm going to show you two

172
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,520
quick stories of things that we've used

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
this technology for in the Boer

174
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,360
lab um so the main focus of the Boyer

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,160
lab is the heart um and in the context

176
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,400
of drug trials cardiotoxicity is one of

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,599
the leading causes of toxicity related

178
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,479
drug failure and there are a ton of

179
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,720
systems in cardiio my sites which are

180
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,840
the heart cells um that can be affected

181
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,240
by a drug um so we elected to study do

182
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,240
rubison which is a known cardox

183
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,199
chemotherapeutic um and it's its sort of

184
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,759
main mechanism of action is thought to

185
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,680
be uh through DNA damage through the

186
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,240
inhibition of a protein called topal

187
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,919
isomerase 2B um and we know that DNA

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,680
damage has pretty um systemic

189
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,120
consequences in the nucleus for one we

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,560
know that it affects um the lamin

191
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,280
structure which is the proteins on the

192
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,800
inner surface of the nucleus and we know

193
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,800
that it can cause DNA uh chromatin

194
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
condensation um in in in the case of

195
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
apoptosis

196
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,199
um so what I'm showing you here are

197
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,360
images of cardium myosite nuclei before

198
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,080
and after expansion before being on the

199
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,879
top and and and after being on the

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,879
bottom and just to note that these are

201
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,520
not the exact same nuclei so they

202
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,080
haven't majorly restructured

203
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,479
um

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,639
and uh uh different concentrations of of

205
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,599
Doc rubison um increasing as you go to

206
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,759
the to the right um now in typical

207
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:04,599
cardiy you know inv vitro dox rubus and

208
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,680
toxicity assays uh people use

209
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,840
concentrations of of of this drug in the

210
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,479
microl range and so we wanted to see if

211
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,120
we could use the additional resolution

212
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,520
that we get with hxm to detect subtle

213
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,639
changes or subtle effects of docon on

214
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,039
these cells and and with the added

215
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,520
resolution we were able to observe um an

216
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,639
apparent increase in uh chromatin or DNA

217
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,280
compaction at the edge of the

218
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
nucleus and so we set out to quantify

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,399
that

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,640
using um a custom analysis pipeline that

221
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,880
I'll sort of demonstrate here what

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,159
you're going to see is as this red ring

223
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,560
uh goes in toward the center of the

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,039
nucleus the curve on the right is going

225
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,680
to track the average signal intensity

226
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,920
along that ring so what we can see here

227
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,560
is there's there's essentially um a

228
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,680
spike in Signal intensity and and this

229
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,440
is um a hoook stain by the way which is

230
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,040
it's like dappy it's sort of the

231
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,160
non-specific DNA stain um we can see

232
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,200
that there's a a spike of signal

233
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,320
intensity right at the edge of the

234
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,079
nucleus that sort of gradually falls off

235
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,880
as we get toward the center so we can

236
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,640
take these curves from hundreds of of

237
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,720
nuclei from hundreds of of different

238
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,680
cells and aggregate them to get

239
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,560
population averages for the different uh

240
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,360
uh dox rubison

241
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,959
concentrations and when we do that what

242
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,959
we see is is first of all when we

243
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,399
compare you know pre-expansion standard

244
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,079
resolution and postexpansion um we don't

245
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,519
really even observe this sort of signal

246
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,720
intensity Peak at the edge of the

247
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,839
nucleus unless we we apply the

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,640
additional resolution

249
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,839
and what's more when we look at these

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,160
peaks of signal intensity um what we see

251
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,399
is that they change in what appears to

252
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,959
be a a doc concentration dependent

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:48,519
manner the the peak sort of tighten um

254
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,079
which in math uh is the curvature of the

255
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,920
peak so we can calculate the curvature

256
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,480
by um taking the the minimum of the

257
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,880
second derivative the curves which is

258
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,000
not really important um and what we what

259
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,920
we get are

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
data that look like this which which

261
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,279
basically show us that we can see

262
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,200
statistically significant uh effects of

263
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,680
dox rubison um on these cells at

264
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,640
concentrations as low as 10 nanom which

265
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,959
is orders of magnitude lower than

266
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,320
typical um invitro toxicity assays will

267
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,640
sort of look at at this

268
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,120
drug um so I want to take a sort of a

269
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,959
moment to pause here and say that if

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,160
there's one kind of take-home message

271
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:33,360
that I hope you take from this this talk

272
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,480
it's that uh increasing resolution in in

273
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,160
imaging um is is really adding

274
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,440
information to your images um and and we

275
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,040
sort of demonstrated that here by

276
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,639
showing that this added resolution um

277
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,720
sort of unlocked an observation that we

278
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,320
were able to quantify but I want to show

279
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
you another example of a way that

280
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,000
increasing resolution can give us more

281
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,440
information about

282
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,560
images um and sort of in line with with

283
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,000
the the last talk actually um another

284
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,600
thing that we're working in the blower

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,600
lab excuse me is uh studying the

286
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,920
intracellular fates of nanom

287
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,800
medicines um and these are drugs that

288
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,959
have to be endocytosed they have to be

289
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,240
engulfed in order to get into the cell

290
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,720
where they're sort of trafficked through

291
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,560
um a a diverse population of different

292
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,760
types of endosomal organel and when

293
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,680
we're studying this process uh

294
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,040
understanding the type of organel in

295
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,680
which these drugs reside can give us

296
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,240
important information about the

297
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,519
trafficking behavior of the drug and

298
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
ultimately it's fate in the cell um so

299
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,480
in fluoresence microscopy we can study

300
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
this type of system by staining

301
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,240
different uh subsets of these organel uh

302
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,639
as as well as the drug and then reading

303
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,040
out differential

304
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,399
colocalization and that image might look

305
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,000
something like this so I'm showing you

306
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,600
here uh a stain of early endosomes with

307
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,240
a protein called ea1 uh late endosomes

308
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,839
and lomes in cyan with a protein called

309
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,320
Lamp one and then the drug in yellow

310
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,120
which in this case is an antibody drug

311
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,200
conjugate that gets taken up into the

312
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,240
cell and and from these insets what I

313
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,240
hope you can appreciate is that we can't

314
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,560
really tell which compartment this this

315
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,680
um this drug is in uh and so this is

316
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,040
kind of where the added resolution

317
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,959
shines because if we if we you know add

318
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,600
that resolution to this image we can

319
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,480
pretty clearly see that this this drug

320
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,120
is interacting with the the early

321
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,920
compartment and not not really with the

322
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,839
late

323
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,959
compartment um so so particularly for

324
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,199
colocalization analyses um we think that

325
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,480
adding resolution is is you know really

326
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:40,600
valuable especially when you have you're

327
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
studying an organel that uh tends to be

328
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,760
very packed inside the

329
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,279
cell um but there's other information

330
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,279
that's baked into the uh the the images

331
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,399
with additional resolution that we can

332
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,399
use um so if we go back to

333
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,639
this

334
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,320
um sort of model of cell staining that I

335
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,240
talked about earlier um what we're doing

336
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,880
here is we're using antibodies to Mark

337
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,760
surface proteins that exist on these

338
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,560
organel that that are thought to be

339
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,920
canonical markers of different types of

340
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,079
of um endosomal organel but in reality

341
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,440
um you know a given protein is going to

342
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,160
localize to a broad swath of

343
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,800
functionally distinct or unique uh

344
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:30,320
endocytic organel and there's there's

345
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,720
value in making that distinction more

346
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,199
granular um and and one of the ways that

347
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,680
we can do that is through understanding

348
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:40,600
the morphologies of these organel um and

349
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,560
so in in earlier transmission electron

350
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,720
microscopy studies of of these types of

351
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,199
organel the main way that was actually

352
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,720
used to uh sort of understand the

353
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,120
identities of of these organal was

354
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,800
through their

355
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,800
morphologies um and in particular uh the

356
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,480
tubulation on these organal is is really

357
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,759
important in sorting and uh the Pres of

358
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,600
these these uh intraluminal vesicles is

359
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,639
an indication of uh maturity basically

360
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,959
and although the resolution that we get

361
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,000
is not nearly as as high as you can get

362
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,759
with transmission electron microscopy um

363
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,959
we still get enough resolution to

364
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,279
um uh sort of get at some of these

365
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,240
morphological features that are really

366
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,440
important so then the question becomes

367
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,480
how do we take the sort of subjective

368
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,759
observations of the human eye and turn

369
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,759
them into an unbiased imag analysis

370
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,399
pipeline that can you know be used on

371
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,920
hundreds of thousands of these images um

372
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,360
and the first step is of course to take

373
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,240
our full fields of view and convert them

374
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,800
into individual uh organel images that

375
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,920
can be independently analyzed and so you

376
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,920
know at the moment we use a combination

377
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,800
of adaptive thresholding and Watershed

378
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,519
segmentation to do that at this point

379
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,199
there are much more sophisticated um

380
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,079
methods for doing that that can um that

381
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:03,639
can do a little bit of a better job

382
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:07,399
excuse me and then the question becomes

383
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:10,360
um how do we you know how do we sort of

384
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,160
understand these organal better and um

385
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,839
you know where we have the human eye to

386
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,120
to kind of pick up features we can

387
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,519
substitute that for deep learning um and

388
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,360
we're we're actively pursuing a number

389
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,240
of different methods um uh supervised

390
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,959
and unsupervised to try and meet this

391
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,959
need but you know as an example one

392
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,959
could imagine taking um

393
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:36,720
a yeah taking a a an autoencoder model

394
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,440
which sort of takes your images and and

395
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
encodes them into a A reduced latent

396
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,959
space that you can then plot on a

397
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
two-dimensional plot like this and use

398
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,079
clustering to sort of classify different

399
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,720
types of

400
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,839
organal um but I think what's what's

401
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,040
really important to note here is that

402
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,360
these types of machine learning

403
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,759
applications require uh tons and tons of

404
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,759
of data and the more data you have the

405
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,639
more successful your general going to be

406
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,560
and so the ability to generate these uh

407
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,759
sort of really high resolution images in

408
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,240
Mass puts us in a pretty unique position

409
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,639
to combine um uh super resolution

410
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,920
imaging and machine learning in kind of

411
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,600
a unique

412
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,920
way um so in summary I hope I've

413
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,000
convinced you that there's some value in

414
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,680
Striking a balance between image

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,440
resolution and throughput um I've shown

416
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,160
you some earlier work that we did in the

417
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,480
vein of of uh sort of trying to show

418
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,319
that the extra resolution that we can

419
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,279
get gives us additional information that

420
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:40,560
we can turn into a a quantification of a

421
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,199
a

422
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,120
new um yeah a phenotype and then um I

423
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,040
showed you some some more recent work

424
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
that we've started working on um in the

425
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,279
vein of trying to think about endosomal

426
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
organal in a bit of a a new

427
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,360
way um and I'll just take this time to

428
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,519
thank my adviser Lori Boer and our lab

429
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,039
we're here at MIT I'm a biological

430
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,039
engineering student um Lori is in the

431
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,600
biology

432
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,199
Department

433
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:15,120
um and are yeah sources of funding and

434
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,120
i'' be happy to take some

435
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:24,520
[Applause]

436
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,839
questions thank you John any questions

437
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,839
from the audience

438
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,160
thank you amazing talk so how about if

439
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:40,200
we extend the high expansion microscope

440
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,200
into spal biology so we can St Sal

441
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,080
Communications

442
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,039
yeah um that's I mean it's definitely

443
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,720
possible I I mean so like the you know

444
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,280
to on a high level the limitations that

445
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,559
you have with expansion microscopy are

446
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,799
essentially you can't do live Imaging uh

447
00:17:53,559 --> 00:18:00,320
because you have to you know blow the

448
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:03,360
cells up um and

449
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,480
well yeah I mean so certainly you know

450
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,520
looking at things like um like CAD like

451
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,720
the connections between cells and and

452
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,039
and that kind of thing is is definitely

453
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,080
possible things like paracrine signaling

454
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,000
where you have you know um an exchange

455
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,400
of factors through the medium would be

456
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,640
more difficult um but yeah I mean

457
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:28,039
definitely would be able to uh to do

458
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,039
that thank you yeah

459
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,440
hey uh great talk I had a question about

460
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,720
the um have you been able to or uh has

461
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,039
anyone tried to apply this to like um

462
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,240
some of the more in each of these Wells

463
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,960
what is the extent of the like high

464
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,760
content Imaging you could do like with

465
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,520
for example the panels of O conjugated

466
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,240
antibodies for like the sort of um

467
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,280
morphological readout of something like

468
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,600
an arrayed crispas screen like I guess

469
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm interested in understanding the

470
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,280
throughput limitations of of of this and

471
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,880
like whether you've uh applied it to

472
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,640
something like PAB view or something

473
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,480
like that yeah the the throughput is

474
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,159
something that I forgot to mention but

475
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,280
um I to put some numbers to it if you

476
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:16,720
we're Imaging the 60 inner Wells of a 96

477
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,039
well plate um if we're getting 20 fields

478
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,760
of view per well which in expansion

479
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,039
microscopy since the thing that you know

480
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,000
sample is getting bigger um the field of

481
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,480
view is effectively getting smaller by

482
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,720
the same um

483
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,640
Factor uh and then if we have like four

484
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,159
channels um the the amount of time that

485
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,280
it would take to image that whole set of

486
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,480
Wells is about 60 hours so it's um you

487
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,039
know like I said it's a compromise

488
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,600
between resolution and throughput um

489
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,600
depending on you know the the the

490
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,480
specific uh parameters that you want to

491
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:57,240
use you can you know go down on the time

492
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:01,360
by uh you know a lot um but

493
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,280
we Chris screens was one of the earliest

494
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,919
ideas that we were thinking about but we

495
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,679
didn't end up going in that direction um

496
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,679
so hopefully that an your

497
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,200
question hi thank you for your talk um I

498
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,400
wanted to ask you you show some example

499
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,280
in 2D would it be possible to do the

500
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,360
same but in 3D when the cells are

501
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,200
embedded in a gel absolutely yeah yeah

502
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,240
um in our in the the do rubison

503
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,919
cardiotoxicity study

504
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,559
um we we use two-dimensional Optical

505
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:38,240
sections of the nuclei

506
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:41,159
um uh

507
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,360
because that's sort of the easiest way

508
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,440
to really get out the the edge of the

509
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,360
nucleus um and it it turns out that the

510
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,000
I think the main reason why the standard

511
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,840
resolution doesn't really work is

512
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,480
because uh for one Optical section

513
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,600
you're getting too much depth of the

514
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,520
nucleus so if you imagine like the the

515
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,960
edge of the nucleus in in the Z

516
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,080
Direction um if you're Imaging where

517
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,760
it's kind of at an angle the the the

518
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,159
microscope doesn't do a great job at

519
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,080
picking up just that uh section of the

520
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,320
of the object and so you have some extra

521
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,520
signal from the sort of the uh the above

522
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,600
and below and it ends up making the

523
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,320
um the the analysis do does not really

524
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:27,360
work but um yeah I mean the so the the

525
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,360
cell the sample expands isotropically in

526
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,039
all directions so you you know as a

527
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,679
result of that you get uh you know 3D

528
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,559
information that's definitely useful and

529
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,279
and it's possible to expand the say if

530
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,159
they are embedded in a gel like really

531
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:46,480
like in 3D if there is a micro oh I see

532
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:49,559
that's a good question it's definitely

533
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,320
possible um there is a limitation in our

534
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,720
technique for the volume of the sample

535
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,360
that you're trying to expand because the

536
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,600
the expansion gel itself is about 250

537
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,240
nanoliters and if you if your sample is

538
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,320
on that order of volume then you end up

539
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,039
um lowering the concentration of the

540
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,279
monomers and and the gel doesn't really

541
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,400
form correctly but we've we've done um

542
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,400
like cell clusters that that are fairly

543
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,279
substantial without much of a problem we

544
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,080
haven't tried really like fully embedded

545
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:24,320
cells other than um cells that are

546
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,080
cultured on kind of like a coating but

547
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,080
it's definitely you know possible thank

548
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,080
you

549
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,300
[Music]

550
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:41,840
any other questions what we have

551
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,440
John can you comment the possibility to

552
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,120
bridge the stor with expansion scope

553
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,720
yeah yeah yeah um there are Labs that

554
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,440
that combine expansion with storm um

555
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,440
there's one in Australia that I can

556
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,000
think of I forget the Pi's name but um

557
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
you know I've never use a storm

558
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,480
microscope so I don't know if you can

559
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,960
put a 996 well plate on a storm

560
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,279
microscope it's not something that we

561
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,039
really thought about because storm

562
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,840
itself puts a limitation on the

563
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,440
throughput and you know we're really

564
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,120
interested in extending the throughput

565
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,159
as far as it can go for expansion

566
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,520
microscopy um but yeah I mean I think

567
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,559
with with a combination of storm and

568
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,559
expansion you can get resolution as low

569
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:25,760
as like 10 nmet without much trouble

570
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,760
thank you
