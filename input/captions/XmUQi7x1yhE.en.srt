00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:10,559
combustion to make lithium ion batteries

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,960
stoffer for more than a century much of

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,600
the world has run on the combustion of

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,480
fossil fuels now to avert the threat of

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,320
climate change the energy system is

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,400
changing notably solar and wind systems

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,480
are replacing fossil fuel combustion for

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,000
generating electricity and heat and

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,520
batteries are replacing the internal

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,559
combustion engine for powering Vehicles

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,559
as the energy transition progresses

15
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,520
researchers worldwide are tackling the

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,200
many challenges that arise silly D has

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,520
spent her career thinking about

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,680
combustion now an assistant professor in

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,480
the department of mechanical engineering

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,960
and the class of 1954 Career Development

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,160
Professor Den Le's an MIT group that

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
among other things develops theoretical

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,280
models to help understand and control

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,440
combustion systems to make them more

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,160
efficient and to control the of

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,720
emissions including particles of soot so

27
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,880
we thought given our background in

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,799
combustion what's the best way we can

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,119
contribute to the energy transition says

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,080
Deng in considering the possibilities

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,720
she notes that combustion refers only to

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,479
the process not to what burning while we

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,880
generally think of fossil fuels when we

34
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,840
think of combustion the term combustion

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,320
encompasses many high temperature

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,960
chemical reactions that involve oxygen

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,280
and typically emit light and large

38
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,799
amounts of heat she says given that

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,320
definition she saw another role for the

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,439
expertise she and her team have

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
developed they could explore the use of

42
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,360
combustion to make materials for the

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,600
energy transition under carefully

44
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,240
controlled conditions combusting Flames

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,600
can be used to produce not polluting

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
soot but rather valuable materials

47
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,040
including some that are critical in the

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,360
manufacturer of lithium ion

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,600
batteries improving the lithium ion

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,600
battery by lowering costs the demand for

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,799
lithium ion batteries is projected to

52
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,360
Skyrocket in the coming decades

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,600
batteries will be needed to power the

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,600
growing Fleet of electric cars and to

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
store the electricity produced by solar

56
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,880
and wind systems so it can be delivered

57
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,160
later when those sources aren't

58
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,280
generating some experts project that the

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,519
global demand for lithium ion batteries

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,239
may increase tfold or more in the next

61
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,920
decade given such projections many

62
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,599
researchers are looking for ways to

63
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,640
improve the lithium ion battery

64
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,959
technology Deng and her group aren't

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,680
material scientists so they don't focus

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,040
on making new and better battery

67
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,120
chemistries instead their goal is to

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
find a way to lower the high cost of

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,400
making all those batteries and much of

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,000
the cost of making a lithium ion battery

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,920
can be traced to the manufacturer of

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,800
materials used to make one of its two

73
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,599
electrodes the cathode the MIT

74
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,480
researchers began their search for cost

75
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,920
savings by considering the methods now

76
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,800
used to produce cathode materials the

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,959
raw materials are typically salts of

78
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,080
several Metals including lithium which

79
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,920
provides ions the electrically charged

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,599
particles that move when the battery is

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,440
charged and discharged the processing

82
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,680
technology aims to produce prod tiny

83
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,239
particles each one made up of a mixture

84
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,080
of those ingredients with the atoms

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
arranged in the specific crystalline

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
structure that will deliver the best

87
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,879
performance in the finished battery for

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,920
the past several decades companies have

89
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,239
manufactured those cathode materials

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,440
using a two-stage process called

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,840
coprecipitation in the first stage the

92
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,159
metal salts excluding the lithium are

93
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,519
dissolved in water and thoroughly mixed

94
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,760
inside a chemical reactor chemicals are

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,959
added to change the acidity the pH of

96
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,799
the mixture and particles made up of the

97
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,280
combined salts precipitate out of the

98
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,400
solution the particles are then removed

99
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,200
dried ground up and put through a SI a

100
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,239
change in PH won't cause lithium to

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,640
precipitate so it is added in the second

102
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,360
stage solid lithium is ground together

103
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,200
with the particles from the first stage

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
until lithium atoms permeate the

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
particles the resulting material is then

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,000
heated or analed to ensure complete

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,239
mixing and to achieve the targeted

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,560
crystalline structure finally the

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,560
particles go through a deag

110
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,680
that have joined together and the

111
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,599
cathode material emerges

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,799
co-precipitation produces the needed

113
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,480
materials but the process is timec

114
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,680
consuming the first stage takes about 10

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,840
hours and the second stage requires

116
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,199
about 133 hours of a knealing at a

117
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,199
relatively low temperature 750° C in

118
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,240
addition to prevent cracking during a

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
kneeling the temperature is gradually

120
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,960
ramped up and down which takes another

121
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,479
11 hours the process is thus not only

122
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,360
time consuming but also energy intensive

123
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,039
and costly for the past 2 years D and

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,240
her group have been exploring better

125
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,800
ways to make the cathode material

126
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,919
combustion is very effective at

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,840
oxidizing things and the materials for

128
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,360
lithium ion batteries are generally

129
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,000
mixtures of metal oxid says Den that

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,479
being the case they thought this could

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,520
be an opportunity to use a

132
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,000
combustion-based process called Flame

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,960
synthesis a new way of making a high

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
performance cathode

135
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,720
material the first task for Deng and her

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,600
team mechanical engineer ing postto Gian

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,000
and Zang Valerie elund dun sb20 sm22 and

current graduate students manasa bot and

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,080
Shu Zang was to choose a Target material

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,680
for their study they decided to focus on

141
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,199
a mixture of metal oxides consisting of

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,720
nickel Cobalt and manganese plus lithium

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,600
known as ncm811 this material is widely

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
used and has been shown to produce

145
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,840
cathodes for batteries that deliver high

146
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,960
performance in an electric vehicle that

147
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,880
means a long drive driving range rapid

148
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,440
discharge and recharge and a long

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,479
lifetime to better Define their target

150
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,000
the researchers examin the literature to

151
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,800
determine the composition and

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,240
crystalline structure of NCM 811 that

153
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,479
has been shown to deliver the best

154
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,160
performance as a cathode material they

155
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,759
then considered three possible

156
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,360
approaches to improving on the

157
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,520
co-precipitation process for

158
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,039
synthesizing NCM 811 they could simplify

159
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,960
the system to cut Capital costs speed up

160
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,720
the process or cut the energy required

161
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,759
our first thought was what if we could

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,520
mix together all the substances

163
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,599
including the lithium at the beginning

164
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,599
suang then we would not need to have the

165
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:14,039
two stages a clear simplification over

166
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:16,000
co-precipitation introducing fasp one

167
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,840
process widely used in the chemical and

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,280
other Industries to fabricate Nano

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,120
particles is a type of flame synthesis

170
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,120
called Flame assisted spray paralysis or

171
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,800
fasp Den's concept for using fasp to

172
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,080
make their targeted cathode powders

173
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,160
proceeds as follows the precursor

174
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,319
materials the metal salts including the

175
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,360
lithium are mixed with water and the

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
resulting solution is sprayed as fine

177
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,960
droplets by an atomizer into a

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,400
combustion chamber there a flame of

179
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,440
burning methane heats up the mixture the

180
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,000
water evaporates leaving the precursor

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,520
materials to decompose oxidize and

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,319
solidify to form the powder product the

183
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,479
Cyclone separates particles of different

184
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,599
sizes and the bag housee filters out

185
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,360
those that aren't useful the collected

186
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,840
particles would then be analed and

187
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,919
deagglomerated to investigate and

188
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,160
optimize this concept the researchers

189
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,960
developed a Labs scale fasp setup

190
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,160
consisting of a homemade ultrasonic

191
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,120
nebulizer a preheating section a burner

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,680
a filter and a vacuum pump that

193
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,759
withdraws the powders at form using that

194
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,840
system they can control the details of

195
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,759
the heating process the preheating

196
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,560
section replicates conditions as the

197
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,759
material first enters the combustion

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,919
chamber and the burner replicates

199
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,560
conditions as it passes the flame that

200
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,240
setup allowed the team to explore

201
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
operating conditions that would give the

202
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,080
best results their experiments showed

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
marked benefits over co-precipitation

204
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,919
the nebulizer breaks up the liquid

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,240
solution and Define droplets ensuring

206
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,160
Atomic level mixing the water simply

207
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,280
evaporates so there's no need to change

208
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,000
the pH or to separate the solids from a

209
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,840
liquid as dang notes you just let the

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,240
gas go and you're left with the

211
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,159
particles which is what you want with

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,159
lithium included at the outset there's

213
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,639
no need for mixing solids with solids

214
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,319
which is neither efficient nor effective

215
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,759
they could even control the structure or

216
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,800
morphology of the particles that formed

217
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,680
in one series of experiments they tried

218
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,919
exposing the incoming spray to different

219
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,520
rates of temperature change over time

220
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,120
they found that the temperature history

221
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,919
has a direct impact on morphology with

222
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,039
no preheating the particles burst apart

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,599
and with rapid preheating the particles

224
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,479
were Hollow the best outcomes came when

225
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:28,159
they used temperatures ranging from 175°

226
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:30,400
C to 225° C experiments with coin cell

227
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,640
batteries Laboratory devices used for

228
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,800
testing battery materials confirmed that

229
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,000
by adjusting the preheating temperature

230
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,519
they could achieve a particle morphology

231
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,240
that would optimize the performance of

232
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,560
their

233
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,039
materials best of all the particles

234
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,680
formed in seconds assuming the time

235
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,920
needed for conventional annealing and

236
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,959
deag glomera the new setup could

237
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,120
synthesize the finished cathode material

238
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,519
in half the total time needed for

239
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,720
co-precipitation moreover the first

240
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,560
stage of the co-precipitation system is

241
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,480
replaced by a far simpler setup a saving

242
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,040
in capital costs we were very happy says

243
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,880
D but then we thought if we've changed

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,959
the precursor side so the lithium is

245
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,640
mixed well with the salts do we need to

246
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,399
have the same process for the second

247
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,160
stage maybe

248
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,120
not improving the second

249
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,839
stage the key time and energy consuming

250
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,399
step in the second stage is the anink in

251
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,040
today's co-precipitation process the

252
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,399
strategy is to anneal at a low

253
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,560
temperature for a long time giving the

254
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,839
operator time to manipulate and control

255
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,560
the process but running a furnace for

256
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,360
some 20 hours even at a low temperature

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,839
consumes a lot of energy based on their

258
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,720
studies thus far Den thought what if we

259
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
slightly increase the temperature but

260
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,000
reduce the analing time by orders of

261
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,200
magnitude then we could cut energy

262
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,200
consumption and we might still achieve

263
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,920
the desired crystal structure however

264
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,079
experiments at slightly elevated

265
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,680
temperatures and short treatment times

266
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:59,640
didn't bring the results they had hoped

267
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,600
for in transmission electron microscope

268
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,240
tem images the particles that formed had

269
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,440
clouds of lightl looking nanoscale

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,040
particles attached to their surfaces

271
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,959
when the researchers performed the same

272
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,440
experiments without adding the lithium

273
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,600
those Nano particles didn't appear based

274
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,279
on that and other tests they concluded

275
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,640
that the Nano particles were pure

276
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,360
lithium so it seemed like long duration

277
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
of kneeling would be needed to ensure

278
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,680
that the lithium made its way inside the

279
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,079
particles but then they came up with a

280
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,440
different solution to the lithium

281
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,720
distribution problem they added a small

282
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,880
amount just one % by weight of an

283
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,760
inexpensive compound called Ura to their

284
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,079
mixture in tem images of the particles

285
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,760
formed the undesirable nanoparticles

286
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,639
were largely gone toang experiments in

287
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,360
the laboratory coin cells showed that

288
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,200
the addition of Ura significantly

289
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,639
altered the response to changes in the

290
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,800
analing temperature when the Ura was

291
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,880
absent raising the analing temperature

292
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,320
led to a dramatic decline in performance

293
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,480
of the cath of material that formed but

294
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,279
with the Ura present the performance of

295
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,000
the material that formed was uneffective

296
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,160
Ed by any temperature change that result

297
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
meant that as long as the Ura was added

298
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,480
with the other precursors they could

299
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,880
push up the temperature shrink the

300
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,920
analing time and omit the gradual ramp

301
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,519
up and cool down process further Imaging

302
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,720
studies confirm that their approach

303
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,880
yields the desired crystal structure and

304
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,240
the homogeneous Elemental distribution

305
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,079
of the Cobalt nickel manganese and

306
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,200
lithium within the particles moreover in

307
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,279
tests of various performance measures

308
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,680
their materials did as well as materials

309
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:33,160
produced by copre itation or by other

310
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,200
methods using longtime heat treatment

311
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,639
indeed the performance was comparable to

312
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,800
that of commercial batteries with

313
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,639
cathodes made of NCM 811 so now the long

314
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,480
and expensive second stage required in

315
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,000
standard co-precipitation could be

316
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,760
replaced by just 20 minutes of a

317
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,920
kneeling at about 870 de C plus 20

318
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,760
minutes of cooling down at room

319
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,120
temperature Theory continuing work and

320
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,880
planning for scale

321
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,760
up while experimental evidence supports

322
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,519
their approach Deng and and her group

323
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
are now working to understand why it

324
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,959
works getting the underlying physics

325
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,880
right will help us design the process to

326
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,079
control the morphology and to scale up

327
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,120
the process to stting and they have a

328
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,720
hypothesis for why the lithium nanop

329
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,639
particles in their flame synthesis

330
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,959
process end up on the surfaces of the

331
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,720
larger particles and why the presence of

332
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,399
Ura solves that problem according to

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,519
their Theory without the added Ura the

334
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,720
metal and lithium atoms are initially

335
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,000
well mixed within the droplet but as

336
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,079
heating progresses the Li diffuses to

337
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,800
the surface and ends up as nanop

338
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,519
particles attach to the solidified

339
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,560
particle as a result a long a kneeling

340
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,000
process is needed to move the lithium in

341
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,639
among the other atoms when the Ura is

342
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,279
present it starts out mix with the

343
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,079
lithium and other atoms inside the

344
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,639
droplet as temperatures rise the Ura

345
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,240
decomposes forming Bubbles as heating

346
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,360
progresses the bubbles burst increasing

347
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,560
circulation which keeps the lithium from

348
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,680
diffusing to the surface the lithium

349
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,360
ends up uniformly distributed so the

350
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,279
final treatment can be very short the

351
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
researchers are now designing a system

352
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,120
to suspend a droplet of their mixture so

353
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
they can observe the circulation inside

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,800
it with and without the Ura present

355
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,399
they're also developing experiments to

356
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,160
examine how droplets vaporize employing

357
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,600
tools and methods they have used in the

358
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,199
past to study how hydrocarbons vaporize

359
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,160
inside internal combustion engines they

360
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,120
also have ideas about how to streamline

361
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,199
and scale up their process in

362
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,800
co-precipitation the first stage takes

363
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,839
10 to 20 hours so what one batch at a

364
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,680
time moves on to the second stage to be

365
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,320
annealed in contrast the novel fast

366
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,560
process generates particles in 20

367
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,079
minutes or less a rate that's consistent

368
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,880
with continuous processing in their

369
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,120
design for an integrated synthesis

370
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,399
system the particles coming out of the

371
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,240
back house are deposited on a belt that

372
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,480
carries them for 10 or 20 minutes

373
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,079
through a furnace a deag

374
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,560
glomeratus apart and the cathode powder

375
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,759
emerges ready to be fabricated into a

376
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,959
high performance cathode for lithium ion

377
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,839
battery the cathode powders for high

378
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,000
performance lithium ion batteries would

379
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,959
thus be manufactured at unprecedented

380
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,480
speed low cost and low energy use Den

381
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,440
notes that every component in their

382
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,079
integrated system is already used in

383
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,519
industry generally at a large scale and

384
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,360
high flowthrough rate that's why we see

385
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,720
great potential for our technology to be

386
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,720
commercialized and scaled up she says

387
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,720
where our expertise comes into play is

388
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,480
in designing the combustion chamber to

389
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,079
control the temperature and heating rate

390
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,720
so as to produce particles with the

391
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,519
desired morphology and while a detailed

392
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,320
economic analysis has yet to be

393
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,160
performed it seems clear that their

394
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,600
technique will be faster the equipment

395
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,399
simpler and the energy use lower than

396
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,639
other methods of manufacturing cathode

397
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,720
materials for lithium ion batteries

398
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,279
potentially a major contribution to the

399
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,519
ongoing energy

400
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,600
transition This research was supported
