00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,080
I've seen this as a call to action and a

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,200
way for me to step up to the problem

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,200
with a potential

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,080
solution. I am researching distributed

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,800
energy resources. I'm compiling a data

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,199
set that takes the data on wind

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,160
turbines, solar panels, electric vehicle

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,320
chargers, and power plants, and sees how

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,480
that data is correlated within counties

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,360
based on the different characteristics

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,000
such as population, education, and race.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,480
I started off first on doing California

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
in the hopes of moving on to other

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,079
states within the US. The most

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,680
interesting thing that I've learned from

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,039
my research is about distributed energy

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,960
resources in general. I had never

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
understood how they were integrated into

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,399
the grid or how they had such a profound

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,680
impact on the energy that we have. I saw

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,840
this project and I saw how they are

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,159
using distributed energy resources and

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,760
the data they have in order to make a

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,640
difference so that other researchers and

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,280
politicians can be informed and make

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,310
good decisions in the future.
