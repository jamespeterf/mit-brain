1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,000
so my name is John W I'm the CEO and

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:08,880
co-founder and I I was in the CTL

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,799
program at MIT back at the turn of the

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,400
century um A lot's changed since then

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,480
and one of the things that's happened is

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,119
that um the geni side of the world is

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,960
really starting to take over and we've

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,119
seen a tremendous amount of uh activity

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,880
in the public data but inside

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,880
corporations and Enterprise data uh that

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,039
is still not really accessible to these

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,239
gen models and the capabilities there

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,640
because it's um essentially incoherent

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,640
data it doesn't have the same

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
characteristics of uh all the

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,960
information that's available on the

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,559
internet and when humans have applied

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,360
all the information uh into these these

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,079
data sets so what we do at uh profit

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,440
Isis is basically we focus on the

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,760
proprietary Enterprise data and because

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,039
we're focused exclusively on companies

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,359
uh and the reason that corporations

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,000
exist is to generate profit uh we are

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,199
basically creating coherent data sets

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,519
associated with profitability and what

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,720
we do in our solution is we create a

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,119
full p&l for every invoice line of every

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,159
transaction um and that allows us to

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,600
make all of the Enterprise data coherent

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
through the language or through the lens

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,040
of profitability so we work with large

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,200
multinational companies we're working

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,360
with a 10 billion doll retailer and

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,360
we're producing at this point uh 1.2

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
billion profit and loss statements that

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,759
allows data sets now to be quite robust

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,720
and can can be used to to support uh

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,520
many large language models and generate

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,640
uh more insights out of corporate

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,840
data we have a lot of history doing this

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,320
we've uh figured out how to uh basically

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,040
uh look at the corporate data through

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,640
the lens of 26 data groups uh we've

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,799
worked with most major types of systems

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,759
and what we do is uh we're based on the

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
Google Cloud we ingest all that data we

48
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,520
do a massive transformation those of you

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,719
whove been around for a while this is

50
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,399
activity based costing now in the fourth

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,320
or fifth generation it's fully Dynamic

52
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,880
once we transform that data then we do a

53
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,119
series of segmentations one of the

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,599
things that we've seen is that

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,080
corporations running on one to five pnls

56
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,239
uh can't see what's really happening

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,000
inside the company because uh the the

58
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,239
traditional p&l uh is one large average

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,760
and what we know is that underneath the

60
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,560
average um there's nothing normal about

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,160
corporations uh they're actually running

62
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,080
the 8020 Rule and once you see the

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,200
underlying data you have the ability to

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,480
make much better decisions and our

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,879
software allows companies to do

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,760
that so we basically will uh augment

67
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,560
these data sets so we're taking Erp data

68
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,000
Freight data hris data um all all the

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,879
data available uh we're transforming it

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,720
into these uh profit and loss statements

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,560
at the lowest level we're then

72
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,599
segmenting and adding value to those

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,599
data sets and then using that as the

74
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:04,120
basic for agentic um uh recommendations

75
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:09,040
on the overall profitability inside the

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,000
corporation okay um just continue so an

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,120
example for A10 billion retailer uh

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,799
we've taken 13 data groups and we've

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,799
helped them improve dramatically their

80
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,760
promotional spending uh We've helped

81
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,319
them improve their their um store labor

82
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,680
planning and we've also allowed them to

83
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,640
do much better uh work with our product

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,120
supplier mix uh with a$1 billion do

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,000
Global distributor uh again we've taken

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,519
multiple Erp systems brought it all

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,879
together uh We've helped them

88
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,480
dramatically with their private label

89
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,840
pricing which they couldn't see before

90
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,439
we actually showed them the

91
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,319
profitability all the way back to

92
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,959
manufacturing uh We've helped them

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,560
identify uh very clear opportunities to

94
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,640
change customer contracts and again

95
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,519
we've shown them the visibility of their

96
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,360
uh product profitability and improved

97
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,000
their mix and finally on the

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,799
manufacturing side uh which is more

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,920
complex across multiple uh continents

100
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,159
and multiple Erp systems we've helped

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,480
them to improve their pricing to reflect

102
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,599
the actual cost of across all of their

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,920
production facilities again that's led

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,920
directly to new customer contract

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,319
negotiations and we've dramatically

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,400
improved their sales and operation

107
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,079
planning based on true

108
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,840
profitability um we basically work with

109
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,880
different parts of the company the

110
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,880
office of the CFO uh store operations

111
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,600
management uh pricing teams and

112
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,080
marketing teams as well as supply chain

113
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,840
teams so each one of these is using this

114
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,280
fundamental new data set and providing

115
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,160
uh strong

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
recommendations uh we're looking for

117
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,560
your help to find a new uh Partners

118
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,160
ideally 200 to20 billion companies and

119
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,199
uh we generally like to talk to the

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,800
senior people in the company because

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,520
this really does change how companies

122
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,520
operate using financial information to

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,479
make better decisions thank you thank

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,840
you so much John um and again good to

125
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:04,800
see see that um you're working globally

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,199
with a lot of companies so um does

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,600
profit aisle have the data

128
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,039
infrastructure and the data availability

129
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,360
to support AI implementation and what

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,240
are some of the foundational elements

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,240
for AI um so the found what we do

132
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,800
because of um the transformation that we

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,520
do to the profit and loss statement

134
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,319
which is universal um we actually our

135
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,520
output is a is a strong Foundation it's

136
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,840
literally the language of profit and

137
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,560
it's absorbable by large language models

138
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,080
and so uh our transformation uh we can

139
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,800
deploy in roughly eight weeks for a

140
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,000
multi-billion dollar company and so

141
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,360
we're doing a massive data

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,199
transformation that is now foundational

143
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,280
for future AI

144
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,840
projects okay and continue with that um

145
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,919
how the current AI initiatives align

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,759
with your company's goals as well um a

147
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,919
lot of the AI work that's going on right

148
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,639
now has been focused primarily on using

149
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,280
essentially this public data uh we have

150
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
seen and we've spent a lot of time

151
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,840
talking with Google their big challenge

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,360
right now is getting Enterprise data to

153
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,759
actually coordinate or connect uh with

154
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,840
some of these other capabilities and the

155
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,360
transformation work that we do for large

156
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,680
companies is really uh uh speeds up that

157
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,440
process and it makes and it achieves it

158
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,880
much more um with a lot less cost than

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,800
if they can do it without our solution

160
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,800
okay John thank you
