1
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:34,719
so good afternoon I'm K from mitb Japan

2
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,360
uh thank you for coming this uh great

3
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:43,640
event an special event for us uh I'm

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:49,840
going to introduce two excellent speaker

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:54,680
in this last section first uh hea

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:58,199
Kik hez kuik is a professor of chemical

7
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:03,400
engineering and chemistry at

8
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:06,640
MIT she received her p uh Bachelor of

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,880
Engineering in chemical engineering from

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:15,280
Cooper Union in

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:20,000
2004 and her PhD in Materials Science

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:25,200
and Engineering from MIT in

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,280
2009 uh she completed uh postto do uh

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,360
Stanford

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,920
2013 and prior to return to MIT as a

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:40,680
faculty member in 20

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,840
2017 I think she likes MIT a lot so she

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,719
left Stanford

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:52,560
University okay and then uh uh she

20
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:57,920
became a uh full professor in uh

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:02,759
2024 last year um her work has been Rec

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:07,200
organized by many our from various

23
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,560
scientific societies and then National

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,959
agencies like

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:18,319
daa uh uh as she has a lots of a from

26
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,640
various Institute uh but please review

27
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:27,560
who her bio on her

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:32,080
website uh her title a talk title is

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,720
getting from a computer to real

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:42,720
world materials faster with machine

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,720
learning uh please welcome uh Professor

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,879
kuik it's my pleasure to have a chance

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,760
uh to talk to all of you today about my

34
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,280
research um so I'm a computational

35
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,680
chemist by training that means that a

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,720
lot of what I do involves thinking about

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,760
how we can discover new materials using

38
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,280
computation and today I'm going to tell

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,000
you a couple of case stories case

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,319
studies where we've tried to close the

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,640
gap between what I predict on a computer

42
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,879
using Ai and what can be realized in the

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,640
lab and tightening that connection

44
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,959
between what's simulated and and what is

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,720
achieved experimentally and the reason

46
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,040
that I think um it's uh valuable to take

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,760
this computational approach is that if

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,599
we for a moment imagine all of the

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,239
possible materials uh that could ever be

50
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,799
studied to address a problem and you can

51
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
pick your favorite problem it could be

52
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,400
one in uh sustainability it could be

53
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
catalytic

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,040
Transformations it could be gas storage

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,959
and

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,640
separations all of those possible

57
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,280
materials we will never scratch the

58
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,319
surface in our lifetimes um and so in

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,159
particular in material spaces I like to

60
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,200
work in are those with Earth abundant

61
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,400
transition metals including transition

62
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,879
metal complex and catalysts metal

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,079
organic Frameworks um and so this is my

64
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,439
depiction of this this hypothetical

65
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,759
space of all possible materials um and

66
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,359
machine learning has matured over the

67
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,759
past uh decade or so to allow us to

68
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,880
maybe not see all of these materials but

69
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,639
to really rapidly speed up how quickly

70
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,479
we screen and infer properties over

71
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,240
large spaces of materials uh but we

72
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,440
haven't solved the problem yet we

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,600
haven't replaced all experimentation

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,199
with machine learning models in instead

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,520
what we can say is that there are

76
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,400
materials neighborhoods we have visited

77
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,759
so there are types of materials that we

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,360
already know about that have been

79
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,080
studied experimentally there are both

80
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,560
generative and enumerative models ways

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,080
that we could hypothesize novel

82
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,080
materials um and then you can imagine if

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,320
I really knew completely all the space

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,440
of all possible materials ones that have

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,639
not yet been synthesized or not yet

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,120
studied

87
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,320
computationally um there's a lot of

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,600
space out there uh that we don't yet

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,440
know about and on top of that if we try

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,440
to move into a space where with

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,319
computation and AI we propose new

92
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,479
hypothetical materials we quickly

93
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,479
encounter challenges where we don't know

94
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,479
in the lab will these be stable or

95
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,319
synthesizable materials so I hope to

96
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,120
tell you a little bit today about how my

97
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,680
lab has tried to address some of these

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,840
challenges broadly by giving you

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,400
specific

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,440
examples and so in the first half of my

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
talk I'll focus on transition metal

102
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,039
complexes in the second half I'll talk

103
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,680
about our extensions to metal organic

104
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,479
Frameworks again focusing on uh two

105
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,240
classes of materials where the

106
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,800
transition metal center has interesting

107
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,360
magnetic and electronic properties and

108
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,400
the organic uh environment around that

109
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,560
metal center both gives rise to

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,080
interesting and challenging properties

111
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,000
that are hard to predict uh denovo

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,280
because they are so quantum mechanical

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,440
in

114
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,479
nature um so as I mentioned uh we think

115
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,680
about transition metal complexes these

116
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:21,400
are widely studied as catalysts in the

117
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,840
fine chemical industry and in uh

118
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,560
polymerization reactions and there's a

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,080
very diverse and fast space of all

120
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,440
possible transition M complexes when we

121
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,080
put these organic ligans around we give

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,759
rise to um with open shell transition Ms

123
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,000
we give rise to different possible

124
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,560
quantum mechanical spin States um and

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,800
different possible oxidation States and

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,400
so in my lab the way that we tackle

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,440
exploring this space with machine

128
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,880
learning is we've developed uh

129
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,880
open-source automation tools called mimp

130
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,479
simplify we've developed machine

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,720
learning representations to allow us to

132
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,240
efficiently machine learn the properties

133
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,680
of transition M complexes on modest data

134
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,879
sets we combine these two together uh to

135
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,360
train neural networks to predict

136
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:12,080
properties Quantum mechanically of these

137
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,479
uh different transition M complexes we

138
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,440
look at where the model is most certain

139
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,919
this is a field known as uncertainty

140
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,240
quantification and we can either exploit

141
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,000
the model where it's most certain or we

142
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,639
can use something called Model

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,599
exploration where we look for promising

144
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,520
but uncertain points and then

145
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,400
iteratively carry out data gener

146
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,080
generation and retraining of models and

147
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,240
the goal in my lab with these tools is

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,479
to ultimately come up with design rules

149
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,759
at the end of the day I'm a

150
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,680
computational researcher and so I never

151
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,360
want to turn to an experimentalist and

152
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,560
say please make this one molecule it

153
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,919
will solve all the world's problems

154
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,319
because I don't really know at the stage

155
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
of predicting

156
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,720
computationally uh if that one material

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,199
can easily be made maybe it's too

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,120
expensive maybe it's hard to synthesize

159
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,039
but we instead think about distilling

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,759
what we learn from traversing these

161
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,960
large chemical spaces of millions of

162
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,120
candidate materials we think about

163
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,319
distilling them into design principles

164
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,240
that can be used broadly When taking

165
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,720
into account other factors we may not

166
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,560
know immediately at this stage so I will

167
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,000
show you one example of this and just as

168
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,319
a note under the hood what we use for

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,479
our representations for transition M

170
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,759
complexes is something called revised

171
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,759
autocorrelations they work very flexibly

172
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,399
with different machine learning models

173
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,519
and they adapt very well to transition M

174
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,360
chemistry um they can do things like

175
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,560
predict the quantum mechanical spin

176
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,719
state of a transition M complex which is

177
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,000
something that would normally

178
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,959
individually for each compound take

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
hours to days with DFT calculations we

180
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,560
can now instead predict them in seconds

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,800
to very high accuracy uh but more

182
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,360
importantly than just predicting uh

183
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,360
transition M complex properties fast we

184
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,560
can carry out feature importance so we

185
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,959
can understand why the model makes the

186
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,800
prediction it does and for instance here

187
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm showing a spin pie chart that shows

188
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,240
that what's going on at the metal and

189
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,760
directly in its neighborhood is really

190
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,920
important for predicting the quantum

191
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,440
mechanical spin state of a transition M

192
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,560
complex and here's a reaction step we'd

193
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,160
like to optimize the Oxo formation

194
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,040
energy for say a selective CH

195
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,480
functionalization step in catalysis and

196
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
you can see these two pie charts are

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,839
very similar so even if you thought

198
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,000
nothing about quantum mechanical spin

199
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,079
before you entered this room if you do

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,519
care about catalysis you'd quickly

201
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,320
realize that we need to know the spin

202
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,480
state if we want to know the reactivity

203
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,000
of this Catalyst and vice versa um

204
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,600
whereas something like the Redux

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,680
potential of the catalyst is actually

206
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,640
totally independent and the reason this

207
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,000
is important is because previously

208
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,560
people had focused on using the redo

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
potential as a heuristic to predict how

210
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,200
reactive a catalyst was and our machine

211
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
learning models show that that's not an

212
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,440
effective

213
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,839
strategy um so what can we do well we

214
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,279
can accelerate C

215
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,839
Discovery we've actually done this a

216
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,760
number of ways uh we've done uh this

217
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,279
type of model exploration approach for

218
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,560
uh searching Redux couples for searching

219
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,240
uh light harvesting chromophores for

220
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,640
photo catalysis but I'm going to show

221
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,160
you an example for a really challenging

222
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,200
reaction so we think the promise of

223
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,000
these Aid driven approaches is greatest

224
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,240
when we think about places where people

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,240
have explored a lot of mechanistic trial

226
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,880
and error work and there haven't been

227
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Solutions found and and and a excellent

228
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,440
example of this from catalysis is the

229
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,880
direct conversion of methane to liquid

230
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,639
methanol and so some of the challenges

231
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,399
for direct conversion of methane to

232
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,200
methanol are that we need to form a high

233
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,279
valent metal Oxo if we think we can do

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,399
this the way that nature does it and

235
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,240
nature does it quite successfully uh

236
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,320
then we need to carry out hydrogen atom

237
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,360
transfer rebound hydroxy of the methyl

238
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,720
radical and methanol release um and one

239
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
of the things we'd really like to

240
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,519
optimize is we'd like methanol to

241
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,839
release quick from the catalyst so it

242
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,240
doesn't get overoxidized while still

243
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,120
favoring the other steps of the reaction

244
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,120
so the way that we're going to explore

245
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,320
this with AI is we're going to create a

246
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,399
candidate pool of 16 million

247
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,200
synthetically reasonable catalysts and

248
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,600
we're going to carry out a series of

249
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,240
rules for assembling these fragments

250
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,680
that recreate known synthetic compounds

251
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,279
that people have worked in the lab for

252
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,839
years but create a lot of Novel

253
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,880
structures that people haven't worked

254
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,920
with yet and to exhaustively study these

255
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,800
experim mentally would never happen in

256
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,519
our lifetime even computationally with

257
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,880
conventional DFT studying 16 million

258
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,040
catalysts is something that would take

259
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,600
me decades to do um so what we do

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,920
instead is we do something called

261
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,920
efficient Global optimization we combine

262
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,920
an optimization algorithm with

263
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,440
uncertainty quantification and the first

264
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,360
thing we do is we Define our objectives

265
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
which are to optimize the hydrogen atom

266
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,040
transfer energy and release energy

267
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,800
simultaneously in this case but you can

268
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,959
think of any possible objectives that

269
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,720
are of interest in a materials problem

270
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,800
and we're extending this to more

271
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,320
objectives uh as I speak um so we go to

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,279
DFT and we we have a patience a budget

273
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,040
for ourselves for about a week with DFT

274
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,839
and we get a handful of points say about

275
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,199
a hundred new catalysts characterized um

276
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,000
and then we're going to train a neural

277
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,000
net and ask the neural net what do you

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,399
think of the 16 million compound space

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
and what we're going to look for is

280
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,120
one's Mo new points most likely to go

281
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,279
past the Paro front so these are the

282
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,160
points that are the most promising most

283
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,240
likely to go past the Paro front but

284
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,279
also most uncertain to the model which

285
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,639
ones can give the most new information

286
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,880
to the model uh then we're going to pick

287
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,680
out candidates and go back to DFT and

288
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,839
this is just a cartoon here but you can

289
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,519
see that we're going to expect that some

290
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,680
of the points the neural net was really

291
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,680
accurate about some of the points not so

292
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,040
much but that doesn't matter because now

293
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,880
we'll retrain the neural net um and

294
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,639
select new points until we continue to

295
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,800
push forward this Paro front uh in

296
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,959
particular a lot of times people use

297
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,920
gaussian processes for this we use

298
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,600
neural Nets with uh latent Spas distance

299
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,279
uncertainty quantification because we

300
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,720
showed this was the most predictive and

301
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,120
efficient way to actually get a good

302
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,720
prediction of future points What's

303
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,720
called the look

304
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,839
aheer uh so this is what it looks like

305
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,320
um so first we have the points from DFT

306
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,519
uh and then we have the expected

307
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,639
Improvement where the points are

308
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,680
predicted to go and we do this for

309
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
several generations and after around

310
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,240
three generations we get new compounds

311
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,800
out and these new compounds generally

312
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,560
have a couple of interesting features

313
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,839
one is that manganese shows up typically

314
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,279
synthetic chemists focus on iron because

315
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,600
nature uses iron uh but we find that

316
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,480
manganese is just as promising as iron

317
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,680
is then we also find a predominance of

318
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,040
oxygen coordinating the metal whereas

319
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,120
nitrogen again inspired by nature is

320
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,720
where synthetic chemists have focused

321
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,360
and then finally we find that anionic

322
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,839
ligans um really do a good job of

323
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,079
reducing the electrostatic attraction

324
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,759
with the uh metal center between the

325
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,320
metal center and methanol and overall

326
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,480
the Catalyst that we find from this

327
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,040
screen have kinetic uh turnover

328
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,759
frequencies predicted from our

329
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,240
simulations where we characterize the

330
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,920
transition states that are comparable or

331
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,360
better than the best-in-class uh

332
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,440
catalysts that have been synthesized

333
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
before but all of this that I've shown

334
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,399
you is just computational we then have

335
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,480
to turn to experimentalists and ask them

336
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,360
to synthesize these materials so I

337
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,880
wanted to tell you about a story of how

338
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,839
we've closed that gap between how we

339
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,800
imagine uh new materials with AI and get

340
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,160
to synthesizing those materials in the

341
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,399
lab in a tighter Loop how do we maintain

342
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,560
that realism but still explore and

343
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,000
discover new materials and so to tell

344
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,279
you about that I'm going to tell you

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,880
about something that's a little bit

346
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,120
further away from catalysis but is about

347
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,399
materials properties and and

348
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,560
toughness and so to do so I have to

349
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,639
introduce aoup couple of phrases you may

350
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,519
not be familiar with um so in the field

351
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,440
of mechanochemistry there are molecular

352
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,519
units known as mechanophores and the

353
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,079
field of mechanochemistry is one in

354
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,079
which we introduce molecularly reactive

355
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:21,079
units into polymer strands then we pull

356
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,000
on them and in pulling on them we cause

357
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,399
Bonds in the mechanically reactive

358
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,839
mechanophore unit to break and this

359
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,680
engenders unique properties to polymers

360
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,839
it can lead to color change es it can

361
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,639
create self-healing polymers and most

362
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,600
interestingly recently it's been shown

363
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,319
that actually introducing weak

364
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,319
mechanophores into polymer networks can

365
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:45,800
actually make polymer networks with

366
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,240
overall stronger properties um and so

367
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,160
most of the time mechanophores are

368
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,880
organic molecules which have their own

369
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,839
limitations but very recently Steve

370
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,120
Craig at Duke introduced ferine

371
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,319
mechanophores and this was one of the

372
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,839
first transition M complex mechan for to

373
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,839
have been studied um and this caught my

374
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,399
eye because I love transition M

375
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,720
complexes and what he found was that a

376
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,839
free ferine introduced into a polymer

377
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,680
strand would actually rotate and shear

378
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,319
and this requires more Force to break

379
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,680
experimentally than ones that have this

380
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,240
calent locking then they have a peeling

381
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,720
mechanism instead but in order to

382
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,560
introduce phines into polymer networks

383
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,040
to strengthen them what we want is we

384
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,839
want the weak peeling mechanism both but

385
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,319
we want to achieve it without a calent

386
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,680
lock and this really caught my eye uh as

387
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,319
a computational design challenge in

388
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,319
particular how could we tune the

389
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,480
non-covalent interactions to alter this

390
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,360
mechanochemical response and the reason

391
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,800
it caught my eye is because if you've

392
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,040
ever worked with transition M complexes

393
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,920
you would know that uh metallocenes have

394
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,639
been studied to death experimentally so

395
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,639
only a couple of them have ever been

396
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,399
studied as as mechanophores only two or

397
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,240
three um

398
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,160
but if you go into the Cambridge

399
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,760
structural database which consists of

400
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,039
structures of transition M complexes and

401
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,600
other things that already been studied

402
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,919
experimentally that have a complete

403
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,520
synthesis recipe and characterization

404
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,039
there's actually 5,000 unique ferroin

405
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,400
completely distinct chemical structures

406
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,720
that are well posed for this problem and

407
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,720
so this is maybe not the entire chemical

408
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,959
Space Universe that I laid out for you

409
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,160
on my first slide but this is a very

410
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,039
large space it takes uh it takes about a

411
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,640
year to do one of these experiments on

412
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,600
just one mechanophore um but if we can

413
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,679
actually explore 5,000 novel materials

414
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,039
computationally with AI then that really

415
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,039
turns into addressing a problem that

416
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,440
would never be addressed um in our

417
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,200
lifetimes on the using experiment alone

418
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,000
and so just as an extra wrinkle of this

419
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,760
there's 5,000 unique feros scenes um but

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,520
we when we're going to simulate them in

421
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,280
a moment I'm going to attach polymer

422
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,080
strands to them and there's some unique

423
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,880
ways that you can differently attach the

424
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,840
polymer strand to the ferine to create

425
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,720
unique compounds so we actually have not

426
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,039
just 5,000 materials to consider but

427
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,520
12,000 um and so what are we going to do

428
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,280
we're going to simulate the effect of

429
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,799
force on these different ferroin

430
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,799
embedded in polymer strands and I'm

431
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,280
going to use a technique called CF you

432
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,440
don't need to know too much about it it

433
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,320
just it uh is an efficient way to model

434
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,360
the effective force and I'm going to

435
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,280
study around 3% of the feasible space I

436
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,559
just created created for you from

437
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,200
materials that have already been

438
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,400
synthesized so that's about 425

439
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,039
complexes and what you notice is that

440
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,919
our data recapitulates what the

441
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,400
experimentalists already figured out

442
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,440
these are the ones that are coal linked

443
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,120
it's really easy to get a low force uh

444
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,240
breaking apart of this ferine compound

445
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,760
but when they uh don't have a calent

446
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,440
link it's harder to get that Force down

447
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,600
but we can distinguish that there's a

448
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,240
tail of low Force compounds that we

449
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,919
already see in this initial set of 42

450
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,559
25 and what we can do is we can train a

451
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,520
a machine learning model a multi-layer

452
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,400
perceptron classifier trained on those

453
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,880
racks I showed you very briefly a few

454
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,919
slides ago and this model performs

455
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,120
really well so it predicts the

456
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,240
computational ability of something to be

457
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,120
either low force or high force and we're

458
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,520
going to do what I call oneshot Active

459
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,960
Learning here so we're going to use this

460
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,960
model to screen the remaining

461
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,240
11,800 materials we haven't

462
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,200
computationally screened so far

463
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,520
and this is what we get we see a big

464
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,240
enrichment now of computationally

465
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,640
validated with DFT points an an

466
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,200
additional around few hundred points

467
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,760
where we predict now much lower forces

468
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,760
and the reason we stop after one

469
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,679
generation is because when we actually

470
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,679
trained a machine learning model again

471
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,840
on this new data and looked at the

472
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,159
remaining points we had yet to

473
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,919
characterize it didn't predict very many

474
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,360
points at all that were left that we had

475
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,799
not yet characterized so we had

476
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,919
essentially saturated the design space

477
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,200
with opportunities to lower the force in

478
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,520
these ferine

479
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,200
mechanophores um so at this point we

480
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,200
went to the experimentalists our

481
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,360
collaborators at Duke Steve Craig and we

482
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,720
had identified lots of neat ways to

483
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,679
lower the force to deize ferene so we

484
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,080
have Pi pie stacking we have St uh

485
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,880
sterically bulky groups we have

486
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,120
non-covalent interactions such as

487
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,280
different hydrogen bonding Partners but

488
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,840
this is where it gets tricky because

489
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,760
we're not just asking them to make

490
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,440
ferene that's pretty easy but we're

491
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,760
actually asking them to use ring opening

492
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,320
uh polymerization to embed the ferene

493
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,280
into polymer strands and networks um and

494
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,159
so we talked with them and we showed

495
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,039
them some candidates and this was this

496
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,039
was an interesting candidate so this was

497
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,960
one in which we introduced steric bulk

498
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,760
on the ferine cyclop pental ring with a

499
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,600
TMS group um and in particular the CSD

500
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,840
ref code that we found was called nus

501
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,400
that's this blue line here and what

502
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,400
we're looking for is a line that crosses

503
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,880
this horizontal line at a lower Force

504
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,320
value this is a slightly different

505
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,520
simulation technique it's slightly

506
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,960
higher Fidelity um and then they looked

507
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,840
at that and they said well that's a

508
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,640
little hard for us to make can we get

509
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,279
rid of this carbonal group and I said

510
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,960
sure and then you end up with just mtms

511
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,080
that's this red line here so you can see

512
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,760
we still predict its uh significantly

513
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,480
lower force and then as control we have

514
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,360
the dash line which is just pure ferine

515
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,440
as well as if you would move this group

516
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,440
you would lose the El Ric effect that

517
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,760
the mtms is having in addition to the

518
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,720
steric bulk and then you get basically

519
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,120
back to the original ferine result here

520
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,520
at the highest Force um so that is

521
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,799
exactly what they made they made the

522
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,640
mtms the material that we predicted this

523
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:46,600
is all computational results right now

524
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,000
um but I'm going to show you right now

525
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,679
what they did what they were able to see

526
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,960
experimentally so in this uh curve what

527
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,120
you're seeing here if you're not used to

528
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,919
looking at these you're seeing how much

529
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,960
the material can be strained Until It

530
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,600
Breaks and so here's the Cove valent

531
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,279
control here's ferine and then here is

532
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,760
the material we designed computationally

533
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,320
so we're able to achieve over a

534
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,240
four-fold increase in network toughness

535
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,240
going from predictions we make with

536
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,279
machine learning accelerated DFT on the

537
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,520
molecular scale all the way up to the

538
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,799
network scale um so I think this is

539
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,880
really cool um but what I think is

540
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,559
cooler is that this is actually a a

541
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,960
property so if you're not used to

542
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,400
looking at those graphs if you want to

543
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,360
see what it actually looks like it

544
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,960
corresponds to this experiment um and so

545
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,240
on the left you see the control material

546
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,960
on the middle you see the ferene and on

547
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,679
the right you see our design material

548
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,679
all three materials will rip uh but our

549
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:46,039
design material will rip

550
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,600
last um and so uh this is an example of

551
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:52,880
something where in a matter of months

552
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:55,159
we've gone from only knowing about one

553
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,760
class of one kind of material to being

554
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,760
able to explore and propose uh from a

555
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,559
space of 12 thousand new materials which

556
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,799
one should be studied and realized in

557
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,200
the lab so a lot of people ask me well

558
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,360
how many failure cases do you have and

559
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,520
the answer is actually none so when we

560
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,679
showed several candidates to our our

561
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,919
synthesis uh colleagues they picked out

562
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,559
just this one to make and this is the

563
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,120
only one they have made so our success

564
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,640
rate is actually 100% on this I don't

565
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,360
expect that to always be the case um but

566
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,480
just to emphasize that we really cut

567
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,480
down dramatically on how many EXP

568
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,120
experiments were being done in the lab

569
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,400
uh to make this happen and this is

570
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,120
exactly where I think the future of AI

571
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,039
and computationally accelerated

572
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,039
materials Discovery needs to go um and I

573
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,919
hope I've conveyed that some of these

574
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,279
observations we've been able to make can

575
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,960
be applied in catalysis they can be

576
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,240
applied in polymer mechanochemistry they

577
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,919
can be applied in a range of different

578
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:58,120
fields um and they all uh can benefit

579
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,679
from very similar themes uh in terms of

580
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,360
how we we think about uh creating data

581
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,679
sets and accelerating the exploration of

582
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,919
chemical

583
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:11,520
spaces so in um the last sort of 40% of

584
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,440
my talk I'm going to switch gears now uh

585
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,000
to a different material space and that's

586
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,480
in metal organic

587
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,559
Frameworks um and so I came into metal

588
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,600
organic Frameworks because I was working

589
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,600
a lot in transition M complexes but I

590
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,600
wanted to study a material that was more

591
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,240
practical and scalable and useful in

592
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,080
industrial applications um and that may

593
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,440
sound funny that I said moffs because

594
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,760
moffs have a bit of of a reputation with

595
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,399
with plenty of Industry folks for not

596
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,919
necessarily uh being realistic at

597
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:42,399
industrial scale for a few reasons I'm

598
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,440
hopefully by the end of this talk going

599
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:48,240
to address a few of them uh in any case

600
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,399
uh but what attracted me to them is they

601
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,760
look a lot like transition M complexes

602
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:55,039
so they have a secondary building unit

603
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,720
where we have metal centers with Organic

604
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,480
lians around this looks just like our

605
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159
transition M complex then we have

606
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,600
linkers connecting these secondary

607
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,799
building units creating open porous

608
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,520
structures and moths are attractive for

609
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,000
a large number of uses today I'm going

610
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,159
to tell you a couple stories about

611
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,279
catalysis gas separation and storage my

612
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,760
lab also works in sensing pretty much

613
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:16,320
the only one of these we don't work in

614
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,840
is drug delivery but I'm I'm open-minded

615
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,240
about that um and because you can mix

616
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,799
together uh many salts and linkers you

617
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,279
can create combinatorially vast spaces

618
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,360
of candidate moth materials you can also

619
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,159
think about iterative combining these

620
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,200
components to create lots of different

621
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,679
materials

622
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,640
computationally but the trial and error

623
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,799
discovery of Novel moths say for gas

624
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,039
storage applications has been really uh

625
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,279
tedious and slow so what I'm showing

626
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,320
here is the year-over-year progress in

627
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,159
changing the pore geometry which is

628
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,880
important for gas storage applications

629
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,799
of moths and you can see uh the

630
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,480
difference the chemical difference in

631
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,960
what are best MF is from year to year

632
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,919
only in a couple cases do we have a year

633
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,480
where really novel MF has discovered

634
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,080
there are many years where the progress

635
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,880
is quite incremental um so there's lots

636
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,279
of data out there about mths there's

637
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,880
lots of things people have tried

638
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:10,480
thousands of researchers have worked on

639
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:14,279
moths uh but trial and error alone is

640
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,480
too slow to identify mths with ideal

641
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,840
properties and one of the things that we

642
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,520
noticed about moffs early on when we got

643
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,840
into this space is the first thing we

644
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,440
wanted to do was develop machine

645
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,640
learning models trained on features of

646
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,320
MFS including what is the poe geometry

647
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,039
of a MF as well as devising a novel

648
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,919
representation called racks for moths in

649
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,799
which we divided a moth into its

650
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,360
different chemical components and looked

651
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,919
at what were the most important features

652
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,640
and one of the first things we noticed

653
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,480
was we could train models on

654
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,720
experimental structures of mths mths

655
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,960
that had already been synthesized or on

656
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,480
these hypothetical sets that people had

657
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,279
enumerated of new candidate materials

658
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,120
that were promising but had not yet been

659
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,320
synthesized and what we noticed was the

660
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,360
feature importance is different if you

661
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,679
use experimental versus hypothetical

662
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,600
moths and this troubled us because we

663
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,080
want to come up with and distill design

664
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,240
rules as I mentioned and so if we look

665
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,159
at these different moth sets we get

666
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,080
different design rules um so we wanted

667
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,440
to look at why that was what is the

668
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,440
difference between moths that have

669
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,080
already been synthesiz versus these

670
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,960
novel moths folks are imagining that

671
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,919
could be the moths of the

672
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,720
future and so here I'm showing

673
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,360
dimensionality reduction in each of the

674
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,919
different feature subsets to try to

675
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,640
depict which of the parts of a moth are

676
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,840
most different between experimental and

677
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,320
hypothetical moths and if you see gray

678
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,919
peeking through that means that there's

679
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,559
an experimental moth but there's no

680
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,480
hypothetical equivalent uh so in terms

681
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,320
of pore geometry uh everything actually

682
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,399
looks pretty similar which surprised me

683
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,679
when I first saw it I thought Poe

684
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,240
geometry the first thing you do

685
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,480
computationally is build a pore that's

686
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,799
way too big same goes for Linker

687
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,799
chemistry and functional groups uh but

688
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:56,480
where the plot actually thickens is when

689
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,720
we look at metal chemistry so in

690
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,519
particular what we see is that there are

691
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,880
many types of sbus that have been

692
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:05,000
studied experimentally that have never

693
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
made it into hypothetical materials so

694
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,840
we tend to think of hypothetical

695
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,399
computational models as being highly

696
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,720
unrealistic and and containing too many

697
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,519
wacky things that can never be

698
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,880
synthesized in the lab but there's

699
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,880
actually many cases where instead the

700
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,480
computational sets actually lack the

701
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,799
diversity that people have already been

702
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,840
able to achieve experimentally so this

703
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:27,679
motivated us to take a different path

704
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,799
and try to learn as much as we could

705
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,919
from the experimental literature in

706
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:35,200
particular tens of thousands of moths

707
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,640
are really well characterized they have

708
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,200
uh single Crystal structures and they

709
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,279
have properties associated with them

710
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,039
that have been published in the

711
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:43,799
literature there are some challenges

712
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,159
with thinking about how we name them and

713
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,559
identify what they are uh so we wanted

714
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,399
to overcome that and in particular

715
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,120
extract all of the information we could

716
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,240
which was made possible by license

717
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,640
agreements MIT Library had with the

718
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,919
Publishers and what we're able to do was

719
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,360
look at 10 th000 papers um or sorry

720
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,440
10,000 structures which which ultimately

721
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,880
boil down to about 7,000 structures and

722
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,720
ask ourselves what do researchers

723
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,120
publish about moths when they write

724
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,679
papers about moths and it turns out that

725
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,919
the two things that came up to mind

726
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,320
first were actually very lucky for us

727
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,240
because both were abundant and both are

728
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,760
really hard to predict computationally

729
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,919
but both are important for thinking

730
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,360
about making moths useful at industrial

731
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,559
scale and so the first is the activation

732
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,760
stability of moths can you once you

733
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,799
synthesize a moth can you evacuate the

734
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,000
pores and make them a stable por

735
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,640
structure or will they collapse and this

736
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,480
is something we use natural language

737
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,080
processing to extract sent with

738
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,159
sentiment analysis whether or not

739
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,000
something was activation stable and the

740
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,799
others the thermal stability of a moth

741
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,240
so if we think about mths for catalysis

742
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,519
one of the chief reasons we wouldn't

743
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,720
want to use them is that they might lose

744
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,440
their crystallinity when we use elevated

745
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,559
temperatures in thermal catalysis um so

746
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,760
here we use training a regression model

747
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:03,440
and we do automatic Griff digitization

748
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,320
of the TGA Trace to avoid ambiguities

749
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,120
with how people self-report results from

750
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,279
TGA traces and so here we have a rack

751
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,000
strained uh multi-layer perceptron

752
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,120
classifier that predicts activation

753
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
stability here we have the model that

754
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,360
predicts thermal stability and so it can

755
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,760
predict the experimentally observed

756
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,640
thermal stability of a moth to around

757
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,799
44c uh the uncertainty in the

758
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,840
measurement itself is 25c so it's not

759
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,200
bad and we can also predict if a moth is

760
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,760
going to be activation stable and we can

761
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
use these models now we can interpret

762
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,640
feature importance to understand what

763
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,440
does it take to make a stable moth and

764
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,360
what's interesting is that both for

765
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,399
Activation stability and for thermal

766
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,039
stability the Linker chemistry actually

767
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,760
dominates this so the atoms are big

768
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,679
meaning that Linker chemistry is really

769
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,640
important and so if we look at this

770
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,159
particular moof it lacks activation

771
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,320
stability um our model would tell us the

772
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,600
first thing you need to do is get rid of

773
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,159
this methoxy group on the Linker and

774
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,240
indeed in doing so we recover activation

775
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,200
stability of this moth if we had relied

776
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,080
on heuristics from the literature we

777
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,159
would have instead said oh the problem

778
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,639
is the metal in this MTH it's zinc why

779
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,120
don't we replace it with calcium doing

780
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,559
that would not have improved the

781
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,360
activation stability of the moth so

782
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:22,639
heuristics that are established in the

783
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,799
literature are outperformed by analyzing

784
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,799
and looking at predictions from our ml

785
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,799
models uh the same thing goes for

786
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,519
thermal stability here there's a lot a

787
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,960
little bit of electronic contribution

788
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,639
but again the Linker dominates so the

789
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,159
average thermal stability of moths in

790
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,880
our set is actually not bad it's about

791
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,519
360 C um and here's a

792
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,120
moth uh that has very low stability only

793
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,840
182c so we see that we should fluorinate

794
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,240
the Linker in order to strengthen the

795
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,120
metal Linker Bond and doing so we

796
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,120
improve the thermal stability by about

797
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:59,039
130c um so more recently we've expanded

798
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,200
this um so one of the things we've done

799
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,880
is we've looked at building models that

800
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,360
can predict the water stability of moths

801
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,360
motivated by the need to be able to have

802
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,200
moths that can withstand high humidity

803
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,799
for direct air capture as well as for

804
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,639
catalysis applications um and so

805
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,519
previous data sets did exist they were

806
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:19,320
out there there were about 200 data

807
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,159
points of of moths in a previously

808
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,880
curated set from about 10 years ago we

809
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,000
use natural language processing to

810
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,039
expand this to about a thousand moths so

811
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,399
about fivefold larger um um and looking

812
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,399
at model performance shows why you want

813
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,080
to actually go to mthfs of having at

814
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:37,639
least a thousand experimental data

815
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,399
points the performance increases quite a

816
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:43,000
bit when you go from where things were

817
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,039
um to where we are now interestingly we

818
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,519
also built the first models to predict

819
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,240
the stability of mths in acid base and

820
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,279
boiling and our acid model we don't know

821
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,679
why entirely performs actually really

822
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,279
well um and interestingly one of the

823
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,440
things that predicts if a mooff can

824
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,720
withstand acid treatment is actually if

825
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,159
it has large pores having large pores is

826
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,440
good for for acid stability and so

827
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,600
things we can do with this is are we can

828
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,320
combine genetic algorithms or other

829
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,519
multi-objective optimization algorithms

830
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,320
um to simultaneously optimize novel

831
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,559
moths now for Activation stability

832
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,480
stability in water and stability in acid

833
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,440
as an example and we're pairing them now

834
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,799
with screening uh for direct air capture

835
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,200
applications um I just like to point out

836
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:30,639
that everything I described is in in a

837
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,200
website so you don't have to be a coder

838
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:36,159
or a computational chemist to use our

839
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,200
models uh this animation shows the

840
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,360
activation and thermal stability models

841
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,080
but the water and acid models are also

842
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:47,679
on there as are models that predict um

843
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,760
the uh uptake of C2 um specifically

844
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,039
ethane and ethylene from recent work

845
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,799
that I didn't have a chance to talk

846
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,200
about where we've also taken this

847
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,360
approach to predict experimental uh gas

848
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,799
isotherms and one of my favorite things

849
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,760
about this is we can do things like show

850
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,880
you where the data comes from as well as

851
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,919
ask you to rate uh the predictions that

852
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,480
we've made and um and in particular uh

853
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:11,960
upload new data if you think there's

854
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,320
something wrong with our model so we

855
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,960
hope to use Community feedback in

856
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,520
particular to um to help continue to

857
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,119
improve these models and so I just like

858
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,800
to finish with one anecdote of where I

859
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,760
think this is going and how I think this

860
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,159
can be useful again coming back to the

861
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,639
theme I introduced earlier that

862
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,679
sometimes what we need is not new

863
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,560
materials but materials that can be

864
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,320
repurposed from other communities um and

865
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,960
so what we did was we went back to

866
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,280
experimental moths um and we looked at

867
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,000
moths that seemed promising for

868
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,639
catalysis but had never before been

869
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,599
studied for Catal catalysis so these are

870
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,359
all synthesized moths um our models

871
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,119
predict them to be stable with respect

872
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,280
to Thermal stability so they're

873
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,839
promising for catalysis they have open

874
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Metal sites where catalytic

875
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,280
Transformations can occur and then we do

876
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,480
again natural language processing here

877
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,920
specifically looking for no mention of

878
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,720
catalysis we don't want to study things

879
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,320
people have already studied before we

880
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,240
want to study materials no one has

881
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
studied before for catalysis even though

882
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,599
they've been studied experimentally and

883
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,520
we screen the top 100 with DFT again

884
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,839
focusing here now on the same

885
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,720
transformation of methane to methanol

886
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,000
and here I'm showing Oxo formation

887
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,599
energy and release energies and the

888
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,839
interesting thing that comes out here

889
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,119
again mirroring what I showed you on uh

890
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,359
transition M complexes is that one of

891
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,280
the big surprises is that manganese

892
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,160
actually seems really promising

893
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,240
manganese moths um end up sort of Best

894
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,000
in Class for both simultaneous release

895
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,520
of methanol as well as favorable

896
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,520
oxoforms

897
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,520
that are now being synthesized and

898
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,560
tested by our experimental collaborators

899
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,440
uh because they have good combination of

900
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,079
overall kinetics predicted for methane

901
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,640
to methanol uh these moths also have

902
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,839
good mechanical iCal stability which I

903
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,480
didn't have time to talk about

904
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:07,160
today um so I think this is actually my

905
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,720
last slide um but uh one of the things I

906
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,240
mentioned is that we have hypothetical

907
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,000
materials out there they're very large

908
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,079
sets so they're very impressive hundreds

909
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,680
of thousands of new moths and so one of

910
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,400
the things we could do now that we had

911
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,119
these experimental stability models is

912
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,160
we could actually find out that many of

913
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,760
the moths that are in these hypothetical

914
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,200
sets actually lack significant stability

915
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,400
they lack thermal stability and

916
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,040
activation stability they need to show

917
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
up in this orange circle here on this

918
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,200
two-dimensional graph if they're going

919
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,079
to have that combined stability um and

920
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,440
so I can pick on lots of different

921
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,440
hypothetical MF data sets none of them

922
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,800
have that high stability so what we did

923
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,200
was we took apart moths that are known

924
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,440
experimentally to have high stability we

925
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,000
broke them down into their components

926
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,560
and then we recombined them in novel

927
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,400
ways hoping we would lead to higher uh

928
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,480
overall stability of Novel materials

929
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,960
that still are closely related to

930
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,839
experimentally synthesiz materials and

931
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,240
in doing so we actually introduced we

932
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:06,000
solved the diversity problem so we now

933
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,000
have metal spus uh all across the

934
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,160
periodic table with much more diversity

935
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,680
than was achieved on previous

936
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,680
hypothetical sets and on top of that we

937
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,359
now have points in that region I told

938
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,040
you we needed to be in to have really

939
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,480
high thermal stability and really high

940
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,200
activation stability we actually achieve

941
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,079
about 20% of our materials compared to 0

942
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,880
2% are now um this very high stability

943
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,000
and we can screen for other properties

944
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,599
such as simultaneously good mechanical

945
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,599
stability and deliverable capacity for

946
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,680
methane and so we for instance find new

947
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:41,000
design rules such as privileged Cobalt

948
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,160
porer inic nodes that can create Open

949
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,119
Spaces but High mechanical

950
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,359
stability so just to finish up I think I

951
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:53,359
have about a minute left um uh I told

952
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,319
you a story where we were able to um get

953
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,000
from the computational prediction to uh

954
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:01,240
experimental realization in the lab by

955
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,880
exploring a space that was synthetically

956
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,280
feasible for transition metal mechan for

957
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,400
Discovery to strengthen polymer networks

958
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,839
I also told you some stories about how

959
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,079
we reveal design rules including

960
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:15,839
directly from experimental observations

961
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,560
in the literature overcoming heris STS I

962
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,760
told you a little something about how we

963
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,640
um uh specifically are able to repurpose

964
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,720
moths for other applications they

965
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,000
haven't been studied for as well as how

966
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,319
we start to think about building

967
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,839
hypothetic materials everything I've

968
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:33,359
told you about today on both the

969
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,000
molecules and on the moths is an open-

970
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,520
Source software it's available on our

971
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,160
website also in cond and GitHub um and I

972
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,480
just like to finish by acknowledging the

973
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,400
students who did the work um their names

974
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,640
are all here but I'd especially like to

975
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,680
mention uh adicha nandy changan o um and

976
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,480
Ilia kevish villy who did the Fantastic

977
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,640
work on the polymers and thank you for

978
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,640
your attention

979
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:03,560
[Applause]

980
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,560
okay

981
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,240
um so um do I ever experience property

982
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,880
gaps where the slightest change in a

983
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,720
molecule dramatically Alters its

984
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,280
physical properties in a ways that are

985
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:22,319
difficult to predict in ml um

986
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,839
so we work with challenging uh open

987
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,560
shell systems that have different

988
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,280
electronic States and the quickest way

989
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,000
to create a proper Gap is to be studying

990
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,079
one type of electronic State um and then

991
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,640
end up in another one with a slightly

992
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,079
different Li we carry out uh data checks

993
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,160
and some degree of sandboxing to avoid

994
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,760
those cases uh a good example of this if

995
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,319
you're a trained chemist would be Lian

996
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,119
non-innocence if you go from having the

997
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,480
spin on the metal to having the spin on

998
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,640
the organic component of the of the

999
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,520
molecule um so we specifically when we

1000
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,599
train our model to avoid confusing the

1001
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,640
model we avoid those examples um but uh

1002
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,520
the Next Generation would necessarily be

1003
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,119
a model that can predict those two

1004
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:13,200
things side by side so the answer is yes

1005
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,200
but that that we kind of Sid step that a

1006
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:21,400
little um so can we predict uh chemical

1007
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,880
behavior of Keating polymers absorbed on

1008
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,720
metal materials such as uh surfaces such

1009
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,079
as steel um so it depends on how many I

1010
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,319
so I think you could use the same

1011
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,760
methodology completely unchanged if

1012
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,400
you're thinking about a local

1013
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,720
interaction but if you also care about

1014
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,079
the folding of the polymer and multiple

1015
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,119
different Keating sites interacting then

1016
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:46,079
I think the right approach would be

1017
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,800
potentially to train um neural network

1018
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,319
potentials and still do uh molecular

1019
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,520
Dynamics but at the Fidelity that can be

1020
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:56,319
achieved um with with uh neural network

1021
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,480
potential that being said if it's a

1022
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,359
local phenomenon we knowing the the

1023
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,440
local effect is sufficient then

1024
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,000
basically what we've done out of the box

1025
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,440
could be used for the same type of

1026
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,760
approach um so I think it is definitely

1027
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,480
possible it depends on the

1028
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,319
specifics

1029
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,480
um it is necessary to convert chemical

1030
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,280
structures into numerical

1031
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,160
representations but has the method you

1032
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,040
are using been validated so that could

1033
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,040
refer to a lot of different things um we

1034
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,640
always validate our models both on set

1035
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,760
aside test data as well well as

1036
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,680
completely unseen out of distribution

1037
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,839
data so for instance in the moth example

1038
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,480
I gave you we were able to automatically

1039
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:39,359
download a few thousand papers and what

1040
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,839
we did to validate our model is we

1041
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,400
picked out new papers we couldn't

1042
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:44,960
automatically download but could read

1043
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,520
with our eyes and validated the models

1044
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,440
that the models still perform well on

1045
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,560
those completely new systems um the same

1046
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,040
thing goes when we're looking we might

1047
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,880
pick say we stud trained a model on

1048
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,920
manganese we would test if it still

1049
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,800
worked on Cobalt

1050
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,560
um there are certain representations

1051
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,640
that generalize better so if your goal

1052
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,640
is generalization you may pay the cost

1053
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,079
more for a better representation one

1054
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,400
example we've done there is we actually

1055
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,680
use quantum mechanical inputs uh into

1056
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,079
our models and then those models tend to

1057
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,480
generalize better than say the

1058
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,280
graph-based representations I showed but

1059
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,960
those are some some ways in which we've

1060
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,960
validated the models

1061
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,640
oh this is a hard question um so uh uh

1062
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,160
because Catalyst driven it's a hard

1063
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,640
question for me um because Catalyst

1064
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,040
driven disruptions will happen across

1065
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,480
multiple sectors simultaneously which

1066
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,800
industry will have the hardest time

1067
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,680
adapting to potential new synergies so

1068
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,119
so I think there are a couple challenges

1069
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,920
um one is does the existing Capital

1070
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:56,400
Equipment does it um uh adapt well to

1071
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,920
different catalysts um that could be

1072
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,280
used for example Le um so there are lots

1073
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,720
of fine chemical applications where I

1074
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,319
think it's much more straightforward to

1075
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,559
think about designing a new Catalyst

1076
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:10,240
structure whereas for very large scale

1077
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,160
chemical production it seems more

1078
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,079
challenging and there's also more

1079
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,480
resistance to thinking about say oh I

1080
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:20,839
always use uh nanop particles that are

1081
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,200
um Palladium coated with with some

1082
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:26,160
carbon or this and that and now you're

1083
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,040
going to ask me to use a moth instead um

1084
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,880
so so that seems seems that's there's

1085
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,599
much more resistance from there whereas

1086
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,160
say in the homogeneous catalysis

1087
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,359
Community I think there's already and we

1088
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,160
work with sponsors where um you know

1089
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:40,920
they are already using the tools I

1090
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,280
described here uh to think about how do

1091
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,559
you design and recommend novel catalst

1092
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,960
structur so I think things that uh can

1093
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:54,760
be scaled up quickly are are where that

1094
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:56,720
would be uh the anyway um so uh um so so

1095
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,359
we like working with with folks who are

1096
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,880
thinking not just about the specific

1097
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:02,920
application but the workflow um so we've

1098
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,760
had great sponsorships like that before

1099
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,599
a lot of what my group does is we

1100
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,680
someone tells us about a problem and we

1101
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,359
develop the software and the approach um

1102
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,000
and so I really enjoy working with

1103
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,800
people who are thinking about something

1104
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,680
not just for one specific Target

1105
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,079
application make this one molecule

1106
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,520
slightly better but how can my company

1107
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,200
adapt the tools that I mean you you

1108
