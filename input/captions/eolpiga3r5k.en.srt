1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
and thank you uh John for basically

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,960
giving my talk dur while I was uh

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,280
putting the slides up so we can probably

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,960
go home a Tey bit early today let me

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,960
just try the um

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,000
how okay yeah how do I go to the next

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,039
slide oh the other green botton okay

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,160
good wonderful thank you all right so

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,640
thanks for the introduction thanks

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,199
everyone for being here um we're going

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,200
indeed to talk about deployment of large

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,800
charging infrastructure for electric

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,879
operations for basically accompanying

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,680
that ongoing transition that is needed

15
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,920
uh to meet all of the uh climate targets

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,399
that we have collectively that that

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,079
involves electrification of

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,800
transportation and Logistics so roughly

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,760
speaking we are um we're developing This

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,960
research agenda so I'm at the stone

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,719
School of Management and I'm also

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,800
affiliated with the operations Research

23
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,399
Center at MIT which is our big doctoral

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,199
program in in in optimization and uh

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,240
what my research agenda really focuses

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,560
on is developing all of the analytics

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,799
and optimization uh capabilities that

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,000
will look at emerging problems in

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,799
transport transportation and Logistics

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,240
so we have one research program in uh

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,920
demand responsive Transit and micro micr

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,600
Transit and how to design and operate um

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,240
uh Hybrid models between right sharing

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,720
on the one hand and public trans it on

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,159
the other hand so how to make Transit

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,520
more flexible or vice versa how to take

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,920
a right sharing Fleet but decrease their

38
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,040
Reliance on single occupany vehicles

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,840
that do contribute to emissions

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,880
congestion and high cost for daily

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,840
commutes how to find this middle grounds

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,320
how can we get the cost of Transit with

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
the convenience of right sharing what

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,200
would that look like and how to optimize

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,399
that so that's one big area of research

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
another big area of research is actually

47
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,680
transportation for social good um if we

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,600
look at so we've been looking at at um a

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,759
number of problems surrounding the

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,080
allocation of vaccines uh the

51
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,200
transplantation of organs from the

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,480
patient locations to the medical centers

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:19,000
um and the suppression of wildfires

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,920
across a uh a big um um a big uh a large

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
regions where we have not only to think

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,599
about how to suppress how to optimize

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,920
suppression activities one fire at a

58
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,959
time but we also need to basically

59
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,800
triage wildfires when they occur and

60
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,760
also route our um fire resources from

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,959
fire to fire so there are a lot of

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,879
opportunities to have impact across the

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,920
systems with uh the type of special

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,120
temporal allocation um methodologies

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,080
that are at the core of Transportation

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,319
optimization and large scale

67
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,440
optimization um today I'm going to talk

68
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:00,120
about this uh oops

69
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,840
sorry this uh last area here which deals

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,959
more specifically with the problem of

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,360
decarbonization so we are looking at

72
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,200
this uh again transition to a an

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,799
electrified future for uh Transportation

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,920
operations and um and the problem is not

75
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,760
only do we have the right CA

76
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,879
technological capabilities in place do

77
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,319
we have the right vehicle Technologies

78
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,280
do we have the right charging

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,120
Technologies do we have do we have the

80
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,560
right interoperability between these

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,319
Technologies it's not only do we have

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
the right planning goals of putting

83
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,599
stations where they're needed but it's

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,640
also how to make it happen where to

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,879
locate these charging stations and how

86
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,000
to operate them and how to operate and

87
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,319
how to revisit how we operate our

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,840
transportation and Logistics systems now

89
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,120
that we have additional charging

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,319
requirements and so that's where all of

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,040
the mechanical engineering civil

92
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,000
engineering layers need to be also

93
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,360
augmented with dedicated analytics and

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,879
optimization layers to support this

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,720
transition and that's where our ALG our

96
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,159
algorithms are trying to make a de right

97
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,879
so that's kind of the framing of

98
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,239
everything that we doing the group and

99
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,239
uh what I'm going to present here today

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,079
in

101
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,120
particular so I'm going to go over two

102
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,600
studies uh um today one is the

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,479
electrification of logistics uh with a

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,040
particular focus on lold operations

105
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,360
which is a study that we have been doing

106
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,840
in collaboration with the MIT

107
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,560
sustainability climate and

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,320
sustainability Consortium Ela was here

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,400
just before she's leading that effort um

110
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,800
and then we're going to talk more

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,280
specifically about um the

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,440
electrification of urban areas um in

113
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,840
collaboration with the MIT Mobility

114
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,759
initiative so if we look at L haul

115
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,240
Logistics uh we have this very ambitious

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,160
very ambitious agenda that uh calls for

117
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,720
widespread electrification of Highways

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,720
so roughly speaking we have already some

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,080
charging infrastructure in urban area

120
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,720
especially again uh when people have um

121
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,160
the the opportunity to have um a

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,919
charging station in their driveways and

123
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,720
whatnot um but we're still lacking

124
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,880
fundamentally some charging

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,720
infrastructure along interstate highways

126
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,440
and and there is this uh call for Action

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,400
to ACC to accelerate uh the transition

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,639
toward uh toward uh clean buses school

129
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,160
buses and trucks in particular which are

130
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,639
really taking the Lion Share when it

131
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,960
comes to Transportation related

132
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,840
emissions um in this country and

133
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,759
abroad and so here we're not necessarily

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,080
asking the question of if electric

135
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,440
electric trucks uh will become a um uh a

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,360
competitive technology uh a lot of uh

137
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,280
signals are saying that the technology

138
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,639
is coming to um is coming to uh uh to

139
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,440
the country relatively soon the question

140
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,360
is how should we plan for it and how

141
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,800
should we improve our um our

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,440
preparedness and so what we've been

143
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,400
looking at in this context is uh the

144
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,120
what is called the electric the electric

145
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,160
vehicle routing problem so roughly

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
speaking the vehicle routing problem is

147
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,240
one of the very old um optimization

148
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,080
problems in our field that deals with

149
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,639
the alloc the the routing of trucks to

150
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,840
deliver packages um in a in a

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:28,319
metropolitan region or in a in a in a

152
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,039
larger region so this is all great and I

153
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,599
think that by now a lot of the companies

154
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,759
that we can think of in that space the

155
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,000
UPS's fedexes Amazon of the world and

156
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,880
whatnot have all very Advanced routing

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,080
software the problem is that if now we

158
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,840
are replacing our vehicles by

159
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,319
electrified Vehicles then we have a

160
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,960
major challenge that deals with how to

161
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,479
revisit the routing operations in order

162
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,720
to make sure that our trucks will not

163
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,840
run out of

164
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,000
battery and when we think about electric

165
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,840
driving at a personal level the range of

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,039
the vehicles are such that now they

167
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,080
exceed what we would typically drive for

168
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,680
a day or a couple of days but when we

169
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,280
look at trucks that have a very high

170
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,919
utilization and high payloads then that

171
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,080
is not necessarily true and we need to

172
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,639
also think about shifts that are

173
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,840
multi-day where people do not

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,000
necessarily sleep for uh I mean the

175
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,120
trucks doesn't necessarily stay idle for

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,280
12 hours at night and so now we need to

177
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,639
rethink how we operate in conjunction

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,720
with how we charge and so that's what

179
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,639
this problem is doing and so in this in

180
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,400
this research we had the I'm going to

181
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
learn how to use this by the end of the

182
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,280
talk I promise but um we we need to

183
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,000
rethink how we uh how we are uh

184
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,240
optimizing these operations with

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,120
electrified requirements and um and in

186
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,479
particular we are uh motivated Again by

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
practice we we needed to model something

188
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,639
that is very important that is

189
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,840
heterogeneity in charging cost across

190
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,000
charging stations some charging stations

191
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,759
are in locations where it's sunny some

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,879
charging stations are in location where

193
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,000
it's not Sunny the cost of electricity

194
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,280
is not the same

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,800
some El some charging stations are in

196
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,280
locations where the grid has capacity

197
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,639
some uh charging stations are in

198
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,400
location where the grid is already

199
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,080
operating uh near capacity the impact of

200
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,520
charging actions is not the same uh some

201
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,720
charging stations are owned by a

202
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,080
logistics providers some are um actually

203
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,360
not owned by the logistic provider and

204
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
the electricity is contracted the

205
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,120
charging cost is not the same so all of

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,039
these factors are integrated into this

207
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,319
um this

208
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,000
model and so rough speaking if there are

209
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,680
some optimizers in the room uh we have

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,159
uh this interesting column generation

211
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,360
algorithm that will basically build

212
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,120
candidate routes iteratively and

213
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,919
optimize out of those and so we have

214
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,839
this decomposition algorithm of a very

215
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
complex decision space into something

216
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,160
that is a little bit more manageable I'm

217
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,200
happy to talk about that offline I'm

218
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,240
just going to go um to go um over some

219
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,480
results uh briefly so the main idea of

220
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,560
this algorithm is that we are kind of

221
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,079
separating operations from charging

222
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,399
station to charging stations and then

223
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,760
we're gluing them together for each

224
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,279
truck and then we're optimizing all of

225
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,680
the all all of the operations of all of

226
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,640
the trucks within the fleet

227
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,720
simultaneously and uh so again um this

228
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,440
is you know the technical part of the

229
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,160
work but uh there is still an

230
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,800
interesting uh lesson here is that we

231
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,519
are making a problem that used to be

232
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,480
instructable now tractable with

233
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,440
dedicated optimization Technologies and

234
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,079
dedicating algorithms and one of the

235
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
practical lessons that this is telling

236
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,440
me is that if we want to support that

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,399
ongoing transition toward

238
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,519
electrification in sustainable

239
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,200
operations in logistics it's not only a

240
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,640
technology problem it's not only about

241
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,480
when are the trucks going to be cheaper

242
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,720
be more effective be more efficient it's

243
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,720
also about can we support the operations

244
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,360
with new algorithms right and what I'm

245
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,240
trying to what I'm going to show in the

246
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,240
in some results is that operating

247
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,279
business as usual uh systems is not

248
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,920
sufficient to make these new systems

249
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,720
effective and so in this case what I

250
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,600
call a business as as usual setting is

251
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,079
to say let's actually optimize routing

252
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
of operations as we used to with

253
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,959
gasoline

254
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,640
trucks and then at the margin optimize

255
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,920
the trips to the charging stations in

256
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,000
order to make sure that our trucks do

257
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,800
not run out of battery right in other

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,200
words we operate um uh we operate

259
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,279
according to business as usual rules we

260
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,240
replace all of our Fleet with

261
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,880
electrified Technologies and then we

262
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,760
adjust operations marginally to make

263
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,639
sure that we remain feasible that we

264
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,120
don't run out of battery right and um in

265
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:54,040
contrast the model that we have here re

266
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,800
optimizes the overall operations by

267
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,760
taking into account the charging needs

268
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,880
and that has an impact on Upstream

269
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,200
operations that has an impact on routing

270
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,440
operations and what we find is that when

271
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,959
we do these two things get together we

272
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,120
get cost improvements that can go up to

273
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,880
5 to 8% in operating cost as compared to

274
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
this routing then charge

275
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,279
characteristics and this lesson is very

276
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,040
important that means that again

277
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,480
strategic planning technology

278
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,560
forecasting technology integration needs

279
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,120
to go hand inand with optimization and

280
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,880
data science and analytics to enable

281
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,279
that that these new systems can be

282
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,399
appropriately supported by these

283
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,120
dedicated

284
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,440
tools uh and similarly we have uh

285
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,839
benefits of accounting for heterogeneous

286
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,200
costs as I was arguing

287
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,200
before so this is a project that we've

288
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,120
been doing again for kind of medium to

289
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,279
longall Logistics um on in um an ongoing

290
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,920
next step in this in this uh in this

291
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,200
area is to also think about the location

292
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,240
of charging stations um from the

293
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,320
perspective of a logistics provider but

294
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,360
also from the perspective of a

295
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,800
Consortium of logistics provider and a

296
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,519
very Salient question right now is

297
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,639
whether there is any incentive for

298
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:15,040
Logistics provider to collaborate in

299
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,399
planning charging stations in order to

300
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
take a simple and cartoonish example

301
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,680
FedEx and UPS are competing on the

302
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,959
delivery Market does that mean they have

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,399
to compete on the charging Market or can

304
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,320
they actually jointly invest in a shared

305
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,160
Fleet of charging stations that they can

306
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,680
then Co operate in the future in order

307
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,760
to get win-win saving in acquisition

308
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,160
cost and a wider footprint right so

309
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:44,040
that's um for next

310
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,560
year okay and so now um in collaboration

311
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,680
with the mobility initiative what we've

312
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,440
been doing is Shifting Gears toward the

313
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,360
urban Mobility

314
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,639
landscape and um and in this space we

315
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,880
also have a number of um important

316
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,959
challenges uh the main one being that uh

317
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,680
again there needs to be a dra drastic

318
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,519
shift in uh the penetration of electric

319
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,680
vehicles um if we want to meet a number

320
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,279
of um a number a number of uh climate

321
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,720
targets that were set forth by a number

322
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,240
of cities and states um and this is

323
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,320
something that is really top of mind for

324
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,560
uh many cities across the country that

325
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,639
are races to add uh charging stations

326
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,760
and actually what is interesting is that

327
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,839
there is this realization that the the

328
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,760
EV

329
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,040
the EV Market has been primarily um

330
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,920
addressing a need for people that have

331
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,199
long Ag commutes and a driveway at at

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,880
home so think let's think about someone

333
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:46,600
who lives in a suban area has a uh

334
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,000
access to sufficient land and capital to

335
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,120
invest in a charging station and then

336
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,920
can actually power their EVS to go to

337
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,639
work and to come back home at night

338
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,440
right so this is really the case in

339
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,560
point range is small enough so we can do

340
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,480
that efficiently um

341
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,320
reliably and um commute the commute

342
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,639
costs are high enough so that it makes

343
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,279
sense for that person to invest in a

344
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,519
charging station because um because the

345
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,079
the cost can be recouped relatively

346
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,600
quickly okay but now what what happens

347
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,800
for people who live in

348
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,040
cities um and so there is this kind of a

349
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,800
nice uh uh nice and provocative title

350
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,000
which is hey wait but where will

351
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,040
urbanize charger e is next and actually

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,920
this is another policy issue OB

353
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,600
obviously for efficiency reasons because

354
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,839
we want to promote the adoption of

355
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,040
electric vehicles but also for Equity

356
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,519
reasons because you have a lot of people

357
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,560
that are in areas that have underserved

358
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,720
um underserved Surly that that remains

359
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,839
underserved by the current EV

360
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,440
Supply so the question that we're asking

361
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,160
in this research is how to deploy an

362
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,360
efficient reliable and Equitable

363
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,680
charging Network and so basically what

364
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,600
we're looking at is the number the

365
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,839
location and the size

366
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,199
of charging uh stations but also the

367
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,680
technology so roughly speaking we can

368
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,440
think about them as level two Chargers

369
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,160
versus Fast DC

370
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,759
Chargers and one of the question that I

371
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,480
find I mean two of the questions that we

372
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,320
find interesting here

373
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,120
are what what what does um what should

374
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,800
the network look like so on the one hand

375
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,360
I could think of an argument that says

376
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,120
you well actually better technology is

377
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,480
better technology if you have access to

378
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,600
a fast charger put fast Chargers

379
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,600
everywhere the concern is that the cost

380
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,319
is also

381
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,199
higher and so if I can if I can do that

382
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,680
I can also replace that Network by a lot

383
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,959
of slower Chargers that can cover a

384
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,480
bigger area so what's the right strategy

385
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,440
here and another question that we find

386
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,160
interesting is how many charging

387
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,959
stations should we have the mental model

388
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,160
that I think we all have is the mental

389
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,519
model of gas stations because that's all

390
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,279
we know where we have to be to be simple

391
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,639
and

392
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,279
simplistic uh let's just put one

393
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,519
charging station per intersection or per

394
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,440
block per little

395
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,360
neighborhood should that be the case for

396
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,279
Ev

397
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,920
Chargers and there is actually this

398
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,880
interesting question because e EV

399
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,480
charging takes considerably more time

400
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,680
than filling up your your tank and so if

401
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,440
you show up at your local Charger

402
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,560
charging station and it happens to be

403
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,839
occupied by somebody it's not going to

404
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,680
be it's not going to become available in

405
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,560
five minutes it may actually take two

406
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,959
hours for that person to to charge their

407
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,480
cars and if locally your all of your

408
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,519
stations are

409
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,920
actually uh occupied as well then you

410
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,920
may uh that may jiz your ability to

411
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,920
drive your own vehicle so potentially

412
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,040
that would be an argument for a few for

413
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,279
fewer bigger charging stations that will

414
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,920
be centrally located so these are the

415
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,880
core trade-offs that we're looking at

416
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,400
which technology and what network

417
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,480
structure so before jumping into the

418
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,480
modeling elements of This research what

419
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,319
we actually did is actually can we learn

420
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,559
something from data that we have and we

421
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,039
have access to excellent data uh data

422
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,079
sources that come from uh Google Street

423
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,640
View so what we've done is that we have

424
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,079
scraped Google Street View uh

425
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,679
extensively and we have done manual

426
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,760
labeling to try to understand where we

427
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,520
could put charging stations out of a

428
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,080
predefined data set

429
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,200
and then we have trained machine

430
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,320
learning and computer vision models in

431
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,520
order to learn what are the

432
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,440
characteristics of the of the street

433
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,200
that enable us to place a charging

434
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:47,039
station here and so the example on the

435
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,360
right shows a a parking a parking space

436
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,440
with a fire hydrant and so that is

437
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,320
clearly not a place where we can locate

438
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,039
a charging station and the model will

439
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,000
pick up on that really quickly on the

440
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:01,280
left we have uh we actually have a

441
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,080
driveway in this case so similarly we're

442
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,880
going to we're going to learn that and

443
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,080
say that no we cannot put a charging

444
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,880
station right

445
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,559
here um and so anyway so we have uh we

446
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,840
have done this and uh from a modeling

447
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:16,000
standpoint what is interesting is that

448
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,360
we have access to an incredible number

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,080
of data uh because Google Street View is

450
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,400
extremely granular every corner of the

451
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,280
street every every every house every

452
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,720
every parking spot you can have access

453
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,080
to it the problem is that this is a lot

454
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,440
of data and that data is actually not

455
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,320
labeled so we could ask all of our

456
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,799
undergraduate students at MIT to

457
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,280
actually label everything here can you

458
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,480
put a charging station here or not I

459
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,280
don't think it's the best use of that

460
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,320
time but it's also extremely labor

461
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,559
intensive and

462
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,200
unreliable so what we need to do in the

463
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,880
space is to do what's called Active

464
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,679
Learning where we actually labeling a

465
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,960
few data points training a machine

466
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,679
learning model trying to understand

467
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,159
where we do well where we do not

468
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,919
retraining new data points and ET ating

469
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,640
that

470
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,240
way um and then the other thing that is

471
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,320
quite interesting from this uh from this

472
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,799
field is that um we have access to

473
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,640
images so images calls for computer

474
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,000
vision methods but actually what we

475
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,080
realize is that we get way better way

476
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,360
more information when we look at

477
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,280
multiple images of the same location

478
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,840
rather than a single one in other words

479
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,720
if you want to understand a

480
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,720
characteristic of a location don't take

481
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,640
a picture take five pictures with

482
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,559
different angles and slightly different

483
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,880
locations the problem is that these five

484
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,960
pictures are not independent so from a

485
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,600
technical standpoint what we actually do

486
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,799
is to use methods from videos rather

487
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,720
than uh pictures in other words instead

488
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,600
of treating one picture at a time we

489
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,280
treat five pictures as basically a very

490
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,720
B very boring movie of the same location

491
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,159
right and uh these five pictures will

492
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,159
tell you way more than any picture

493
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,600
independent all right so this is um this

494
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,440
is number one so uh we ended up with a

495
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,600
model that reached 90 plus% accuracy and

496
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,080
area under the curve um we have trained

497
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,799
um models on hundreds of thousands of

498
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,720
data points we have used um we have used

499
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,559
this model uh to deploy in the entire

500
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,400
city of uh Detroit uh again this is in

501
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,480
collaboration with the mobility

502
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,240
initiative in Michigan Central um which

503
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,240
is um which is a a think tank based out

504
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,720
of Detroit um and we have in Ed quite a

505
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,000
bit of time and resources to build these

506
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,159
types of uh interactive visualization

507
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,320
tools so that users can actually go

508
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,640
there look at where we project charging

509
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,600
stations can be located in green and

510
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,400
where we project that they cannot in red

511
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,000
we allow and we have that platform that

512
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,360
allow for user feedback uh so we can

513
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,400
retrain our models uh iteratively and so

514
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,200
we're actually going to uh going to

515
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Detroit in in a couple of weeks to um to

516
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,720
uh get gather more uh more deployment

517
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,080
data here and see how this can uh how

518
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,120
this fails in a real world setting so um

519
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,279
interesting lessons here in terms of

520
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,320
active learning in terms of video

521
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,480
analytics and in terms of human in the

522
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,559
loop

523
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,640
assessment um and finally um back to our

524
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,279
original question which is how should we

525
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,000
build a network of charging stations in

526
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,000
an urban area so now we take the output

527
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,080
of the machine learning model mainly all

528
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,279
of the Loc

529
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,760
that we were uh we project can host a

530
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,880
charging uh a charging uh

531
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,480
station and we uh cross correlate that

532
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,400
with two other types of inputs one is uh

533
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,720
where are people living where do they

534
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,279
work and where do they travel so we take

535
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,120
granular information on there on trip

536
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,520
trip level um trip level data um and

537
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,919
then there is also another uh another

538
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,559
type of input that is the grid capacity

539
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:02,600
in each location so how cost would it be

540
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:05,880
to invest into a new charging station

541
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,039
here so again we we get uh we get this

542
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,159
we feed that into an optimization model

543
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,000
so large scale integer optimization

544
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,200
model that will

545
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,440
essentially Place charging stations in

546
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,240
the network and then replicate the

547
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,080
travels and the trips of everybody in

548
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,559
the city to make sure that we can power

549
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,320
the existing trips with the with the

550
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,080
available uh

551
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:34,360
Network in and uh we have two types of

552
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,880
results the first result is um a result

553
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,480
on technology and the other result is a

554
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,919
result on optimization so on technology

555
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,080
we find benefits of hybrid networks and

556
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,039
that goes back to what I was saying

557
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:52,760
before level two fast DC answer both and

558
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,159
the reason and so we have developed uh

559
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,480
we have developed some theoretical

560
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,200
results to guide uh to get these

561
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,520
principles but the the main reason is

562
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,440
that you have a lot of heterogeneity in

563
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,880
your network so in a sense if you have

564
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,400
everyone that goes to work to the same

565
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,200
location DC is great you just put one

566
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,600
gigantic DC charger at the work location

567
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,000
call it kendle Square everyone goes

568
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,120
there you're going to have enough

569
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,200
capacity for everyone to charge between

570
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,799
900 and 5:00 p.m. then they go home and

571
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,640
they can come back the next

572
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,760
day the problem is that you may not have

573
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,159
enough capacity in kle square to satis

574
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,640
all of that demand or everyone may not

575
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,200
be working in kendle square right and so

576
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,000
they may be going to many different

577
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,760
locations if that's the case you end up

578
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,400
with some nodes in your network that are

579
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,000
much smaller and actually from an equity

580
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,480
standpoint this is fundamental because

581
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,679
these are the people that also need

582
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,520
access to charging station that do not

583
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,279
necessarily have the right recourse with

584
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,360
other options to charge and so we need

585
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:00,240
to complement the big fast charging

586
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,520
stations by small and cheaper charging

587
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,880
stations that will be based on level two

588
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,919
Chargers and we have again theoretical

589
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,640
results for this but uh practically we

590
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,080
find that hybrid networks can deliver

591
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,640
benefits on the order of 10 to 20% as

592
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,880
compared to uh investing all in in one

593
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,880
technology all level two all all DC uh

594
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,480
fast

595
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,200
Chargers and number two is um so again

596
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,440
we built that optimization model we uh

597
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,320
implemented it with real world data we

598
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,679
build our algorithm we made it work

599
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,799
right question you know was it worth it

600
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,679
and um and I think that a good Benchmark

601
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:39,720
here is to say you know what let's

602
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
assume that we don't know where people

603
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,159
are and we we don't we're not as you

604
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,679
know granular in terms of like where to

605
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,640
put the charging stations could we do

606
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,039
something like common sense and to me

607
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,720
common sense is let's put charging

608
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,320
stations where people live where people

609
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,200
work right and so we do like a sort of a

610
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,039
clustering algorithm here where I'm

611
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,960
clustering home locations work locations

612
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,960
putting charging stations there and then

613
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,240
I decide the Technology based on the

614
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,159
number of people that live live around

615
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,880
and then we get Ben benefits on the

616
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,840
order of 20 to 30% again that echo my

617
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,120
result in the previous uh section where

618
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,720
it's not only a matter of you know when

619
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,360
are the EVS coming when are the charging

620
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,960
stations coming and what should we do

621
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,200
what type of Technology should we have

622
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,360
what type of Technology will be

623
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,559
available but also how to use all of

624
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,320
these Technologies right and how to

625
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,080
design a network that can satisfy the

626
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,440
broad needs of the population in an

627
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,480
effective and reliable

628
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,120
manner all right so this is um this is

629
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,880
essentially wrapping up my my talk um so

630
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,799
again the lesson is optimization models

631
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,760
and algorithms for emerging applications

632
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,760
in transportation in logistics with a

633
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,440
focus on electrification and

634
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,480
decarbonization happy to talk more

635
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,240
offline or here if we have time but uh

636
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,240
thank you so much for your

637
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,200
attention will okay any

638
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,520
question yes

639
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,520
please

640
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,200
yeah yes yes yes

641
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:21,360
yes no uh this is a very uh this is a

642
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,360
very good uh very good question uh this

643
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,919
is um there is a price to pay in what

644
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,120
we're doing which is we're solving a

645
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,360
more difficult optimization problem and

646
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,120
so we are

647
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,240
getting a solution that is like within

648
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,039
1% of optimality and sometimes whenever

649
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,679
the true benefits are actually small um

650
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,520
the loss in accuracy in a sense can be

651
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,919
can uh outweigh the the benefits right

652
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,360
so I think about it as like I would

653
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,600
benefits of charging of a better

654
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,440
optimization is 0.5% but the cost of

655
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,080
difficult optimization is 08 and so here

656
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,200
we have the3 loss uh but this is this is

657
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,559
really an anomaly and roughly speaking

658
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,720
we got I think five 5% benefits in in

659
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,799
most cases yes

660
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,240
please so you talked about where you

661
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,880
live and where you work but also where

662
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,600
you shop wear a lot of them our today

663
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,760
and also you see some in

664
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,480
airports but you know if somebody's

665
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,039
going away for two weeks that's far more

666
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,360
than than the time they need to charge

667
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,279
so probably

668
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,200
sitting absolutely absolutely so to the

669
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,000
first point where you shop yes and so

670
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
that's why we need uh trip level

671
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,159
information trip level information will

672
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,840
tell you where people go and then

673
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,840
whenever we have an opportunity if we

674
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,640
have reliable information that tells you

675
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,640
that one person that lives in one place

676
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,080
that works in another place but always

677
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,600
go goes to you know that mall on

678
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,679
Saturday and then you if you have a

679
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,200
charging station in that mall well that

680
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,240
actually serves a lot of purpose so

681
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,320
that's what that's actually one of the

682
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,799
drivers uh of these benefits is that we

683
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,640
have visibility to that and we can

684
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,320
leverage it so absolutely good good

685
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,720
remark when it comes to the airport um

686
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,200
yes you're right and there is a a a big

687
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,200
question that I think we don't have an

688
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,360
answer to um as a society which is how

689
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,840
will people use these charging stations

690
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,440
and um

691
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,919
again if we take the analogy of the gas

692
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,960
station I go there my T my tank is empty

693
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,320
I fill it up and then I leave this is

694
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,120
manual and I stay here with my car the

695
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
whole time and then there is a stop

696
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,320
start there is an

697
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,200
end if I think about charging stations

698
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,919
it's very different because the time to

699
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,120
charge can be 2 hours 3 hours and I

700
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,320
don't want to stay with my car during

701
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,880
the whole time I'm going to go to work

702
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,080
I'm going to go shopping and whatnot um

703
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,919
the problem is that I don't have a

704
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,399
three-hour work day I wish um but I have

705
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,480
a much longer work day so if I plug my

706
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,120
car when I show up to work not even

707
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,679
talking about a two we trip at the from

708
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,120
the airport I'm just talking about like

709
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,799
an 8 to 10 hour workday if I plug at

710
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,440
9:00 a.m. my car will be full at 11: but

711
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,200
I may occupy a spot for the entire day

712
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,640
and I think that this is actually a

713
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,919
major challenge underlying all of this

714
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,600
and this is something where we

715
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,519
collectively don't have the right answer

716
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,600
we're going to need to think about new

717
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,080
mechanisms to incentivize people to

718
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,440
exactly charge what they need when they

719
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,480
need it and there may there may be

720
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,760
multiple answers so here I don't have

721
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,240
any research to share with you I'm just

722
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,519
thinking out

723
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,039
loud pricing can can be an option right

724
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,200
and uh whenever you are here and you're

725
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,840
full you're going to have a higher rate

726
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,480
so then okay during my lunch break I'm

727
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,600
going to come down and move my car and

728
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,320
come back up uh there may be companies

729
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,880
that can do that right I mean where you

730
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,080
basically give your car to company and

731
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,360
you ask for some level of charge and

732
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,880
then they can actually do the routing

733
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,320
within the parking garage I'm not sure

734
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,320
exactly what's going to happen uh but I

735
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,000
think that the management of um the

736
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,039
management of uh charging times so to

737
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,440
speak is uh is fundamental and this is

738
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,600
something that we're not really used to

739
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,600
doing right it's the analogy I have in

740
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,360
mind is whenever I Char charge my phone

741
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,279
overnight my my phone um my phone needs

742
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,880
one hour of battery and I sleep for more

743
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:18,600
than one hour and um and so how to how

744
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,360
to how to manage that will be a question

745
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,919
the difference is that my phone taking

746
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,960
of space in my home doesn't prevent

747
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,600
anyone else from charging but my car

748
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:33,840
taking a space in my in mit's garage

749
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:37,240
prevents other people from charging um

750
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,000
another exciting opportunity with uh the

751
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,399
with Michigan Central in Detroit is that

752
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,840
they actually have deployed charging um

753
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,440
charging stations in their own garages

754
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,200
uh and they're collecting a lot of data

755
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,080
on usage and what we would love to do is

756
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,720
to try to understand whether we can

757
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,000
actually do some experimentation here to

758
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,440
see how people respond to different

759
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,840
pricing incentives uh so again maybe

760
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,919
hopefully more to come next year on this

761
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,559
but uh but I think that this is a very

762
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,960
important question on how to manage uh

763
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,960
charging

764
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:16,600
Cycles any parting

765
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:20,279
question oh cool thank you all your Alex

766
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,960
thank you so much thank you I you

767
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:25,159
know I just I just want to tie this last

768
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,960
conversation back to sort of where we

769
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,880
started this afternoon which is you know

770
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,000
know looking at the 10 Trends talking

771
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:37,039
about sort of the impact on uh Battery

772
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,880
Technology a couple points on charging

773
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:47,080
okay so ginoa mentioned that Neo a

774
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:52,039
Chinese OEM has uh about 3,000 battery

775
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:54,519
swap stations now across China now this

776
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:57,039
is really an interesting model to think

777
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,279
about in the charging Universe right

778
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,080
because for those of us who have been in

779
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,559
the mobility space for a while we might

780
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,919
remember a company called better place

781
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:07,240
they had this you know business model to

782
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,080
do battery

783
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,760
swap and and it didn't work out and

784
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,159
there's a lot of sort of interesting

785
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,000
analysis we can do when we dig down into

786
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,919
why it didn't work out and to why it

787
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,639
could work out now in this sort of

788
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,240
second attempt uh that's happening with

789
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:28,919
Neo in China and it's really interesting

790
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,399
because if you think about

791
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:35,399
um the battery of an electric vehicle

792
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:39,080
right the battery of an electric Hummer

793
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:42,000
weighs more than a Honda Civic so the

794
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,440
energy that you're expending to move

795
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,559
around that heavy battery is very very

796
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,279
significant and arguably very wasteful

797
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,440
so as we start to think about new

798
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:55,279
modalities of charging beyond the work

799
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,159
that you know Alex is doing on

800
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,080
optimization of the existing system we

801
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,399
can think about you know some of these

802
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,480
these new models and another really

803
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,880
interesting model is wireless charging

804
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,519
there's a company right here in our

805
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,519
backyard witricity and MIT spin-off that

806
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,880
has been working on this for many years

807
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,880
and has an ex exceptional

808
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,919
technology and where is it being

809
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,039
deployed does anyone know the first OEM

810
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:27,159
to actually integrate witricity

811
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:28,639
technology is First Automotive Works in

812
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,360
China

813
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,720
so you know I'm just trying to tie

814
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,240
everything back together that the world

815
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,000
is changing quite quickly particularly

816
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,600
in the mobility space um I hope that

817
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,320
this uh Mobility track has been

818
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,440
informative for for everyone and we want

819
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,070
to thank you so much for for joining us

820
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,150
today thank you

821
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,150
[Applause]
