1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,120
Good afternoon everyone. Um I'm Insong

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,280
Kim uh from political science and this

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,280
is joint project with Yon Donkel uh

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,679
who's sitting right there uh from

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,679
mathematics uh department. So our

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,840
project is titled tentatively as

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,640
mathematics of law making in the United

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,279
States and we are hoping to share some

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,519
of um preliminary results that we have

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,880
uh with you guys and hopefully uh you

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,640
will see something very interesting

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,480
about the law makingaking in the United

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,719
States.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,120
uh special interest groups uh engage in

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,239
lobbying to influence the legislative

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,879
process in the United States. Um there

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,719
are actually more than 12,000 bills that

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,559
are introduced in each congressional

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,719
session. 12,000 bills. It's not only uh

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,480
Obama healthc care bill or Trump tax

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,440
bill uh or IRA kind of bill uh that we

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,719
all know uh but there are also other

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,039
so-called micro bills uh where special

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,879
interest groups are lobbying to affect

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,280
the legislative politics at the very

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,080
very granular

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,000
level. We know uh based on our data

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,799
collection effort that most of these

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,200
bills uh are actually lobbyed and then

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,400
we collect our data according to the

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,799
lobbying disclosure act of 1995 which

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,600
legally requires all the interest groups

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,920
to report uh their lobbying activities.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,920
And one of those uh lobbying activities

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,720
include which type of the legislative

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,640
bills that they have lobbied

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,439
on. And this is a great opportunity for

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,920
researchers like us to uh systematically

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,240
measure the competing interest uh in the

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,680
legislative politics which we all agree

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,920
probably will be very very

42
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,439
important. However, there exists very

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,240
few empirical studies that examine who

44
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,479
supports or who opposes which bill. uh

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,399
whether supporters and opponents

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,520
dominate at different stages of the

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,119
legislative process and or which

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
political actors are more or less

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
successful in advancing their

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,600
legislative goals. These are all very

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,800
very important questions to ask and

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,440
answer uh but very few empirical studies

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,440
exist. So my question to you all is

54
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,480
why given what's happening in Washington

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,640
DC these days I guess we all want to

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,280
understand

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,560
this and there's a vast uh literature in

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
the field of political science or

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,400
computational social science in general

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,879
um uh that have examined um interest

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,720
group politics in Washington DC for a

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,959
long long period of time but from

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,680
empirical perspective there literally uh

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,560
no studies arguably to systematically uh

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,560
study these uh at a large scale. You can

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,120
see a journalistic coverage of one of

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,640
those uh questions uh every now and

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,519
then. But we are talking

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,840
about systematic um uh extensive study

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
of the entire legislative bills for

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,519
example that are being considered in

72
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,480
Washington DC. So the answer to this

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,560
question is that it is extremely hard to

74
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,120
identify which bills interest interest

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,760
groups

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,239
lobby. Even when we can find who lobbies

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,480
on which bill, interest groups are not

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,239
legally required to uh disclose whether

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,000
they have supported or opposed bills. So

80
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,959
despite the significance of these

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,760
questions, it's very uh difficult and

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,239
therefore few studies exist to examine

83
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,400
these

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,720
questions. So in this project uh we are

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,599
trying to overcome these challenges.

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,840
The agenda for today's talk is to just

87
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,680
visually show the data that we have

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,319
collected so far uh and motivate the

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,640
importance of studying the uh interest

90
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,439
group positions based on the signals

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,080
that we have observed and then show you

92
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,799
just a simple descriptive stat regarding

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
the unequal representation in the US law

94
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
makingaking uh so that we can all think

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,239
uh together about the importance of uh

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,280
the representation uh in democracy.

97
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:18,880
Y so this is actual data uh that we have

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,919
collected uh during last 15 years uh

99
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,880
based on the lobbying disclosure act of

100
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:27,199
1995. You have the federal filings uh

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,199
that specifies which clients in the

102
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,800
first column that is you can think of

103
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,040
this as uh Apple um the company interest

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
group and then registrance uh who

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
represent the client Apple uh in this

106
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,000
case the K Street lobbying firm in

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,560
Washington DC. You also know the

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,120
identities of individual lobbyist who

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,120
have been hired by these law firms to

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,800
represent the interests of the client

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,000
Apple. You also uh have a measurements

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,680
uh of how these lobbyists are linked to

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
uh different government agencies like

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,840
FDA for pharmaceutical industry uh or

115
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,080
SEC for financial um uh industries and

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,720
so forth. In terms of whether a lobbyist

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,440
has any revolving door connections uh or

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
experiences in those agencies, we also

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
have a me measurement uh of the

120
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,919
connection political connections between

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,320
the lobbyist and the legislators uh at a

122
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,880
very very gr granular level. So if a

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,560
lobbyist has ever worked as an intern

124
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,880
for a senator a for three months uh then

125
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,720
we observe that. So you can imagine

126
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,400
extremely granular measurements of the

127
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,560
political network and very high

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,560
dimensional um uh data that we need to

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,639
analyze the lobbying uh disclosure act

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,919
and then the derivative database that we

131
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,520
have uh created uh lobby view actually

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,320
uh captures a lot of interesting

133
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,560
signals and this is just a visualization

134
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
of what's happening um we're not going

135
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,360
to read all of this but I want to draw

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,520
your attention to this part for example

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,880
when there was a 911 um uh you see a lot

138
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,960
of uh lobbying spike represented by this

139
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,800
dark shaded red um cell uh involving

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,759
aviation and airlines. Okay, so this is

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,639
just uh just a predictive validation if

142
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,400
you will where we are actually capturing

143
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,960
something very meaningful in terms of

144
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,120
what's going on in Washington DC in

145
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,520
terms of the issue area. On the right

146
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,240
hand side you can also see uh

147
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,919
differences across the different

148
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,800
administration. So you see uh the Trump

149
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,960
the first Trump uh is uh associated with

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,840
a lot of lobbying happening regarding US

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,080
customs and border protection. Okay. And

152
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,080
then you see that uh by gathering this

153
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,560
highdimensional data, you can actually

154
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,960
map not only what's going on in

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,840
Washington DC, but also map the

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,120
political communities, if you will, um

157
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,639
that are uh driving uh the law

158
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,319
makingaking in Washington

159
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,319
DC. I'm going to move on to measurements

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,080
of interest group politics. So we know

161
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
what's going on. uh we know who's

162
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,280
lobbying on which bill but we want to

163
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,160
know whether certain interest groups are

164
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,720
taking particular positions uh toward a

165
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,960
particular legislative

166
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,680
bills. So to that end we are also

167
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,479
creating a new data set for lobby bills

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,919
and committees. Here is an example of

169
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,479
what's actually being reported in

170
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,919
lobbying report. You can see that uh

171
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,599
interest group uh lobbyed on HR 83 which

172
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,680
is a house bill uh 83. So what we are

173
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,680
doing is by parsing through

174
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,919
automatically parsing through the

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,280
universe of the lobbying reports filed

176
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,479
by all interest groups to identify which

177
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,560
uh interest groups have lobbied on which

178
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,599
bill. You may think that is very easy to

179
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,360
extract out this information but this is

180
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,599
one of the reason the difficulty of it

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,879
is one of the reasons why uh we spent

182
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:03,599
last 15 years uh to even create this

183
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,039
data set. You can see this HR83 um uh

184
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,840
being a bill from House of

185
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,879
Representative but uh there are 110th

186
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,520
Congress 80 uh HR83 111th Congress HR83.

187
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,160
So just because you observe HR83 doesn't

188
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,319
necessarily mean that you can correctly

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
identify the

190
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,240
bill. Therefore, in this case, it's very

191
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,240
important to compare and contrast the

192
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,919
bill number and bill title and so that

193
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,959
we can correctly map this HR83 213

194
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,839
Congress bill. And of course, we do more

195
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,839
sophisticated u uh algorithmic

196
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,320
approaches for measurements such as in

197
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,279
this case affordable care act uh with

198
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,920
with no bill number listed. Uh we're

199
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,240
going to look at the text difference uh

200
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,320
distances between what we have observed

201
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,720
here uh with the universe of um the bill

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,040
titles database uh to be able to

203
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,120
correctly identify the bill number as

204
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,920
well as the

205
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,320
title. So we consider uh over 108,000

206
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,560
congressional bills introduced since 106

207
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Congress. We for each one of those

208
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,720
lobbing activities we identify um uh the

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,279
the lobbing activities based on over one

210
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,440
million lobbing report and we then link

211
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,600
uh these reports and the instance of the

212
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,320
lobbing to committees that consider each

213
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
bill and also the individuals who are

214
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,360
serving on uh in the committee

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
congressional committees to consider

216
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,839
this bill which will then be used to

217
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
create the highdimensional network data

218
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,519
that I presented earlier.

219
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,320
So once you have uh the measurement of

220
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,959
uh which bill is lobbyed by which

221
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,680
interest group now is the next step is

222
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,560
to see the traditional uh measurement.

223
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,640
So let's look at the top part. Um the

224
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,120
lobbying report uh actually um reads uh

225
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,519
endorsement of the hidden figures

226
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,560
congressional gold medal act. So in this

227
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,560
case we know that this is in support of

228
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,680
passing this bill. On the other hand,

229
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,000
another case where defeat S 23, the

230
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,880
Senate bill number 23 and HR1249

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,160
uh which is a clear indication that the

232
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,519
interest group uh is opposing um uh the

233
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,200
bill, right? Of course, not all the time

234
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,680
we observe this. Um so what we do is to

235
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,959
manually measure uh this type of the

236
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,560
leanings uh oppose opposition or support

237
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:33,680
of the bill. uh and then we uh use a

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,959
large language model to go through um

239
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,720
the each individual uh text to have a

240
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,360
its own measurements of the support

241
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,200
opposes etc. And then we can then

242
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
compare the performance of the large

243
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
language model to tune its performance

244
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
uh to have a proper measurement of the

245
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,519
support oppose.

246
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,079
For those on the bottom side for those

247
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
where we do not have any uh textual

248
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,839
information about the position of the

249
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,640
bill what we utilize is to uh is uh

250
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,240
analyzing the systemic p pattern

251
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
revolving around the bill level

252
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,560
lobbying. So in this case we know that

253
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
this particular interest group uh has

254
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,279
lobbied on this bill based on the

255
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,160
earlier measurement strategy. Uh but we

256
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,839
do not know whether um it has lobbied

257
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,320
for or against even when uh we were able

258
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,200
to measure for some of them. So what we

259
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,279
then do is oh let's look at uh you know

260
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,120
the history of the lobbing activities

261
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,959
and then involve the lobbyist and the

262
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
lobbying companies and then history of

263
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,680
the position taking that we have learned

264
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,440
from this upper part. So the idea is

265
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,680
that if um A and B uh are lobbyed on

266
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,120
similar bills in the history and then we

267
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,160
know that they have taken a similar

268
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,480
position and then now we have a

269
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,560
measurement of A's position toward the

270
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,880
bill let's say support but we do not

271
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,040
observe B's uh position toward the bill

272
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,839
but it's reasonable to at that point

273
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,079
respect that B B might have also shared

274
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,920
a similar type of the position position

275
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,360
toward the bill and that's how we

276
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,639
utilize this highdimensional network

277
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,120
data to be able to predict uh the

278
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,360
positional uh leaning of each individual

279
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,240
interest groups even when they do not

280
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,320
disclose uh their

281
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,720
positions. So once you do that then some

282
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
interesting patterns will emerge. What

283
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,360
we found is that upper part is the

284
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,000
enacted bills in Washington DC. Uh we

285
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,399
see that there is a uptake here in this

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,959
purple which um uh captures the

287
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,639
monitoring activities. So we see that a

288
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,320
lot of interest groups start uh

289
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,720
monitoring the implementation of the

290
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,040
past bill. So it is not only that you're

291
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,680
allowing to affect the bill making but

292
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,240
also how uh you are going to affect the

293
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,760
implementation of a you know public law

294
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,600
once it is uh enacted. You also see on

295
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,519
this bottom figure that once the bill

296
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,279
have been passed on the floor before

297
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,959
presidential action like a veto for

298
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,279
example uh you see an uptake in

299
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:01,360
opposition. So you see that uh interest

300
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,839
groups that are trying to block the bill

301
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,399
start uh collectively uh gathering

302
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,959
together to mobilize to oppose uh the

303
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,519
passing of the bill. This is we believe

304
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,079
is a very important finding. uh in fact

305
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,000
that what we are trying to do is to uh

306
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,720
characterize this high dimensional data

307
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,040
as u a function of a multiple

308
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,040
conditional probabilities um from

309
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
mathematical modeling perspective and

310
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,920
one of the conditional probabilities is

311
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,880
to see whether firm size is related to

312
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,959
the lobbing activities what we find is

313
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
that not surprisingly larger firms but

314
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,040
the positive on the right hand side of

315
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,720
this particular line means that larger

316
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,880
firms are positively associated with

317
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
this activity. So we see that larger

318
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,800
firms are positively associated with the

319
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,519
lobbying activities. So larger firms

320
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,760
will tend to lobby more but we f what we

321
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,560
found here is that smaller firms are

322
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,440
more likely to oppose. So this suggests

323
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,560
that uh in the legislative process big

324
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,880
firms are lobbying to influence uh the

325
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,360
agenda setting and introduce a lot of

326
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,600
bills but it is a small interest groups

327
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,120
or very small actors that tend to be

328
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,360
very reactive uh by uh start opposing in

329
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
the later stage of the uh legislative

330
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,000
process. So this is this bottom part is

331
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,399
one of the first times that actually

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,720
social scientists uh will be able to

333
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
look at uh the differences in the

334
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,680
political activities as a function of

335
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,279
the firm firm

336
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,320
size. Finally I just want to share with

337
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,480
you uh a brief um sort of uh descriptive

338
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,880
stat on the unequal representation in

339
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,800
the US law making. So this is the

340
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,880
lobbing report again another example of

341
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,519
lobbing report and I told you that in

342
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,800
lobbing report uh we actually observed

343
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,800
all the all all the lobbyists who got

344
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,480
involved in lobbing this particular

345
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,880
activity. Um the lobbyists are listed by

346
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,360
name on filing but we know very little

347
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,600
about who they are. So what we went uh

348
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,600
what we did was went to the web page of

349
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,959
this particular K Street lobbing firm

350
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,639
and then tried to find who these person

351
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,560
uh persons are and then sort of put the

352
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,800
uh pictures of each individual lobbyist

353
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,199
involved in this particular uh lobbying

354
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,600
activities which is the representing DAO

355
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,920
chemical uh company. It's a chemical

356
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,880
multinational company. Do you see any

357
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,880
pattern from these pictures?

358
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,760
Yes. Uh major lobbying firms uh tend to

359
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,399
hire overwhelmingly uh larger number of

360
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,079
a white male lobbyist.

361
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,800
Um so what we have done is to

362
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,839
standardize and dduplicate uh uh based

363
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,760
on the all uh various name identifier uh

364
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,079
try to identify each individual

365
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,480
federally registered lobbyist to learn

366
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,880
about the composition uh of the

367
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,839
lobbyists in terms of their racial uh

368
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,279
and gender

369
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,680
distribution. Of course this has been

370
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,279
very very difficult and uh even when

371
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,040
you're using cutting edge algorithm

372
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,360
sometimes the measurements is not quite

373
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
correct. So what we're doing is to find

374
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,839
each individual lobbyist in the LinkedIn

375
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,240
data and then uh and then uh connect uh

376
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,320
their information uh the name name

377
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,320
information with their education uh

378
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,240
gender ethnicity and then history of

379
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
their employ uh employment and so forth.

380
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,800
So we have a very very granular

381
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,440
measurement of them. But just to show a

382
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,680
simple stat you see on the left hand

383
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:31,519
side um this is uh the distribution over

384
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,320
racial groups and the uh the light blue

385
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,959
represent the uh population proportion

386
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,199
and then dark blue represents the actual

387
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,000
distribution in the lobbying industry.

388
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,240
So against the population distribution

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,920
uh for the white uh you can see that uh

390
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,639
overwhelmingly larger number of the uh

391
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,160
Washington DC lobbyists are actually

392
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,880
white and it uh that unequal

393
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,440
representation becomes even more severe

394
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,600
uh if we uh wait that based on

395
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,600
experience in lobbying that is that you

396
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,480
know how long uh the lobbyists have

397
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,160
worked in the Washington DC. So what we

398
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,919
learned is that uh the senior lobbyists

399
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,559
are even more disproportionately

400
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:17,199
represented by uh white uh white

401
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,120
male. So this is just a descriptive uh

402
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,559
uh uh stats that I've shared and

403
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,919
hopefully this gives you an idea about

404
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,360
what we are working on. I look forward

405
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,360
to uh Q&A.

406
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,679
Thanks. Thank you very much. some

407
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,679
questions.

408
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,679
Hi. Uh to add even more confusion, uh

409
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,919
one thing that goes on in um Congress is

410
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,320
that sometimes the representatives

411
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,240
change their uh trade their votes.

412
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,320
They'll say, you know, you vote for this

413
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
bill and I'll vote for that bill. So,

414
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,679
you know, it could be that a lobbyist

415
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,000
convince uh a senator or representative

416
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,919
to vote for a bill, but then they trade

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,960
away that vote, you know, on something

418
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,520
else or because of party machinations.

419
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,520
So, does that also throw you off? Yes.

420
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,720
Uh that's definitely very uh very

421
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,240
important. Um first of all, people

422
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,559
weren't able to even measure whether

423
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,679
it's a for. So, we are moving forward in

424
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,760
that regard. regarding the uh for

425
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,520
against uh and change of the positions

426
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,000
as a result of the lobbying. One of the

427
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,039
good ways to look at is the history of

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,799
the legislative bills. So uh there are

429
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,440
12,000 bills that are introduced in

430
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,960
Congress as I mentioned uh but only a

431
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
few hundreds are actually voted on the

432
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,240
floor. So what happens to all these

433
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,320
other uh 12,000 um uh bills um that have

434
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,480
been introduced? It turned out that a

435
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,600
lot of those so-called micro bills, the

436
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,080
text within those bills are cut and

437
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,880
pasted onto the later so-called omnibus

438
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,760
bills uh to reflect this low lowering

439
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,600
behavior. Basically, I uh uh support

440
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,000
this bill uh not that bill, but if you

441
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,559
agree to include the text from this bill

442
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,200
that I support in the later bill that I

443
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,360
might uh support this bill. So given

444
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,039
that we can actually uh look at the

445
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,919
history of the bills and then the

446
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,600
positional um taking of not only the

447
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,360
interest groups and associated

448
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,120
politicians will be able to actually

449
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
answer that but we haven't actually

450
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,400
quantified that yet. Okay. So what

451
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,520
you're saying is that there's basically

452
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,919
a record of that trade. Uh well uh uh

453
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,240
it's not a record of the trade. uh you

454
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,720
have observed a pattern that might

455
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,280
reflect some of those uh you know uh

456
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,440
under the table trade happening. Okay,

457
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,440
thank you.

458
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,039
This is um a bit of a very grounded

459
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,000
question, but is what is the legal or

460
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,200
formal definition of lobbying? And I'm

461
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,600
curious how comprehensive a data set

462
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,480
like this would be for lobbying type

463
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,200
efforts or if given the constraints

464
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,799
implied by like the language of the law

465
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,080
everything that we might think of as

466
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,000
labeling is covered by these reporting

467
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,320
mechanisms.

468
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,840
Thanks. Uh so based on the lobbying

469
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,919
disclosure act of 1995 uh the lobbying

470
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,480
is defined as uh the defined in terms of

471
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,880
lobbyists spending their time. So if you

472
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,360
are spending uh certain I forgot the

473
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,679
exact number but let's say that 50% or

474
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,880
more of your time representing uh

475
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,880
interest of uh your client then that is

476
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,799
uh defined as a lobbying activity and

477
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,120
then if you satisifi if your lobbing

478
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,120
activity satisfies that definition then

479
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,520
you are legally required to file

480
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,080
quarterly the four times a year report

481
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,280
describing your lobbing activities. that

482
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,640
said that um that definition does not uh

483
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,400
fully cover all the other um uh you know

484
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,240
let's say the 5% use of your time

485
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,640
representing uh your client interest

486
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,720
might not satisfy the definition. Uh and

487
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
therefore it's true that there are a lot

488
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,520
of other lobbing activities that are not

489
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,600
being measured. Uh so there will be um

490
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,919
uh you know the cases like that but from

491
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,880
researchers perspective it is is that

492
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,960
one is we cannot really measure right.

493
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,039
So what we are doing is to start with

494
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,559
this uh lobbing activity based on the

495
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,480
legal definition of the lobbing and then

496
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,120
try to capture the universal lobbying

497
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,760
from that perspective and uh the

498
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,559
government auditing agency um uh

499
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,080
frequently audit the behavior of uh

500
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,080
individual interest groups lobbing

501
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:43,360
activity. The last time that I saw the

502
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:47,840
report, uh their report says that 97%

503
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:51,919
um uh of their targeted uh investigation

504
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,679
uh has shown that 90 97% of uh interest

505
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,360
groups have properly reported their

506
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,000
allowing activity based on the

507
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,000
definition of the law.

508
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,280
Further

509
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,520
questions? Thanks. Um, I guess this is

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,520
sort of a two-part question, but I am

511
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,240
curious seemed like you're not really

512
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,760
able necessarily to identify the client

513
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,640
in all cases, but I'm wondering do do

514
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,559
patterns emerge where certain lobbyists

515
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,880
tend

516
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:33,280
to represent certain types of clients or

517
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,440
certain types of causes or certain types

518
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,120
of political um movements or

519
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,840
perspectives?

520
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
Uh, yes. Uh but I I don't know what made

521
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,120
you think that we do not I might have

522
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,720
just not I might have just stepped away

523
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,120
when you shared that. Yeah, we do

524
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,440
observe the clients uh individual uh

525
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,360
lobbying activities. Uh and we do

526
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,240
observe their position taking for

527
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,600
individual bills. Uh maybe this will be

528
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,679
an interesting um uh example that I

529
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,440
prepared. So you know that drug

530
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,760
sentencing is a perhaps the most

531
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,640
egregious uh example of systematic uh

532
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,679
discrimination in American policym. Do

533
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,159
you know about this uh this story about

534
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,799
uh cocaine, powder cocaine versus uh

535
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,720
crack cocaine? Um it turned out that

536
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,480
there is like a 100 to1 ratio in

537
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,400
punishment differences. Um uh where uh

538
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,640
the crack cocaine users will be 100

539
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,520
times more punished. And then it turned

540
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,080
out that uh uh the although the white

541
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,480
and black Americans are uh use drugs at

542
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,559
the comparable rates uh the crack

543
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,559
cocaine users are overwhelmingly black

544
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,280
and powder cocaine users overwhelmingly

545
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,360
white. And what we were able to do is to

546
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,600
look at this particular legislation in

547
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,159
2009 uh house bill number 34 uh25 and

548
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,559
then see uh in this case the left hand

549
00:23:52,159 --> 00:24:00,240
side is um uh NA uh CP and the right

550
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,240
hand side uh is a lobbying by FOP right

551
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,799
and then uh given the lobbying

552
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,520
activities we were able to uh measure

553
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,159
whether one is a support uh and the

554
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,039
other is opposed and then we were able

555
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:17,600
to uh see that those who has opposed one

556
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,279
in that the actual uh law making

557
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,039
reflected their interest. So we can go

558
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,960
this far uh in individual individual uh

559
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,480
bill we know the universe of the

560
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,039
interest groups at least based on the

561
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,360
definition of the lobbying uh who oppose

562
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,279
and support it how they're distributed

563
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,440
how they organize their lobbing activity

564
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,600
is differently in terms of the uh the

565
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,840
timing of the lobbying like a later part

566
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,360
or beginning part and then for those

567
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,000
bills that have been actually voted on

568
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,320
the floor and then passed into a law uh

569
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,799
we'll be able to also systematically

570
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,880
measure whose interests or either

571
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,240
disproportionately or proportionately

572
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,880
represented in the law making.

573
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,440
Yeah. Um my questions are probably a

574
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,320
little a field from what you're what you

575
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,919
talked about, but there's a lot of or

576
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,600
number of things in legislation for

577
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,919
economic uh bills where it's worded in

578
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,400
obscure ways that are pretty hard to

579
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,200
figure out what's going on, but designed

580
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,880
to benefit a single firm. Yes. And I'm

581
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
just wondering if that's something

582
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,520
you've looked into and can recognize

583
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,799
when things look like they might be

584
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,039
benefiting a single firm. Yes. Um so

585
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,559
what we have done is uh for each

586
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:34,640
individual uh bill uh we know who's

587
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,120
lobbyed, right? So we counted the number

588
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,760
of interest groups that have lobbied on

589
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,240
any given

590
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,799
bill. If you give me a random bill and

591
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,679
then uh we are going to count the number

592
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,240
of the all uh interest group that have

593
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,200
on that uh particular bill. What do you

594
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,640
think it is the median number for any

595
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,679
given bill? We're going to count the

596
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,279
number of interest groups that have

597
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,200
lobbied on a given

598
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:05,120
bill. That's a very uh aggressive

599
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:09,200
prediction. Uh the median number is two.

600
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,480
um often the the one is a subsidiary of

601
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,480
the other. So uh the point that I'm

602
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,279
trying to make is you're exactly right.

603
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,440
There are all these micro bills uh that

604
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,320
are representing the interests of a very

605
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,480
very uh small number of interest groups.

606
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,480
And if you interview a lobbyist in

607
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Washington DC, everyone knows that oh

608
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,320
this bill is Apple bill, this bill is a

609
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,720
Google bill. We just don't know because

610
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,559
there's just one sentence says that oh

611
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,520
if a company uses this technology A then

612
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,919
revenue generated by the technology A

613
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,360
will be

614
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,440
taxexempt and it turned out that there's

615
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,320
only one company in the world that uses

616
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,240
technology A then that particular line

617
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,919
in the legislation could be seen as a

618
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,880
private good of that particular interest

619
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,120
group and our goal is to try to uh uh

620
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,440
create a connection between uh you know

621
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,159
that micro bills and then Individual

622
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,159
interest groups
