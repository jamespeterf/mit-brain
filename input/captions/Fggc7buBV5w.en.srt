1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,400
and uh welcome to the startup exchange

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,919
thank you so much for having me I will

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,719
be speaking about Lighty AI let me share

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,400
my screen so I'm Richard rabbat I was

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,720
previously VP of product at Twitter I've

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,920
exited my previous startup that I sold

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,400
to Snapchat and I've spent a number of

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,519
years at Twitter Google Zinga and other

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,039
places TW 20 years experience and a PhD

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,439
from MIT co-founding team is all MIT

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:35,320
alums as well and the problem that we

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,559
decided to address is the fact that with

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,600
uh you know AI in general most of these

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,280
models have been actually trained on

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,239
public data as opposed to capturing the

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,399
unique uh unique DNA and of the

17
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:54,359
Enterprise itself so these AIS that you

18
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,320
use today are not trained on your

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,039
private data they're just trained on

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,000
publicly available data meanwhile uh

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,400
everybody's under pressure to adopt AI

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,880
because of productivity Improvement

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,000
potential and Lighty AI is an agentic AI

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,960
that

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,520
allows a company to capture the DNA of

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,000
that Enterprise so our llm is very

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,280
specific to the Enterprise and it's

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,880
powered by a Knowledge Graph and that

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,040
Knowledge Graph is all the data that is

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,159
collected you know that is private to

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:33,399
the company emails wikis documents

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,880
calendars that allow our AI to be much

33
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,840
more effective when it comes to like

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,439
supporting uh the organization and the

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,360
things that we talk about in terms of

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,960
workflows are things all the like all

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,520
the way from the beginning from like

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,640
onboarding a person to planning and

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,840
coaching because like these days you are

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,399
we're in a situation where people like

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,840
are looking for help to like actually

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,960
you know improve their uh their

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,759
productivity schuling is a very

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,399
important task because like you know

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,360
typically people are very interrupted

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,200
all the time and we you know our AI

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,879
helps you with scheduling Tas

48
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,280
assignments but also tracking of your

49
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,200
objectives and key results all of this

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,599
is based on personal personalized

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,040
interactions so that the AI like really

52
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,680
speaks to you as an individual the team

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,200
and the or the

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
organization here's an example of the AI

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,440
agent at work in this case it is helping

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,360
with scheduling a meeting instead of me

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,080
conent like looking at my calendar and

58
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,120
trying to like offer some times the AI

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
will just like look at my calendar

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,640
propose it to the other party schedule

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,680
it and then put it on the calendar and

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm not interrupted every interrupt

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,280
today actually cost us about 20 minutes

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,480
of like know trying to get back into

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,760
Zone and like liy basically does away

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,239
with all these

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,920
interruptions and it's all powered by a

68
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,879
knowledge graph that is private to the

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
Enterprise this is something that we're

70
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:03,040
very excited about where like you know

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,080
on the day before your next day Lighty

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,120
send you an email about like reminder of

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,720
like what your plan is for the for the

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,560
next day and highlights some issues in

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,920
this case I have uh I I'm looking at my

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,959
schedule and it looks like I'm like I'm

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,080
all set if I need to make some changes I

78
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,120
will ask it like in this case I want to

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
cancel a meeting I'm going to cancel the

80
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,360
daily leadership syn and lightly does it

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,760
I don't have to get out of the flow and

82
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,760
it just does it for me

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,760
uh and then finally like as Lighty

84
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,360
learns about you and your goals it like

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,760
looks at like how you can actually be

86
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,560
better at like how you manage your time

87
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,680
in this case I've told ly that like I

88
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,159
want to spend spend more time on deep

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,280
work and then it looks at my you know

90
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,799
where I'm spending my time and then that

91
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,360
tells me that in this case I should

92
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,439
actually spend more time on like

93
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
blocking times for my deep work and

94
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,840
other things as well

95
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,879
uh and then finally like you know we all

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
come out of meetings and we've had like

97
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,920
a lot of you know action items that we

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,079
sometimes forget what liy does is like

99
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,239
actually capture all the transcripts and

100
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,400
turn them into action items and uh you

101
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,720
know follow-ups that so that you're

102
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,680
effectively conducting your meetings and

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
the post meeting work that you're

104
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,759
doing uh we're looking for additional

105
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,240

companies Enterprises and mid Market

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,120
in this case we would like to you know

we you know identify specific kpis to

113
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:51,120
deliver on and really solving about like

114
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,120
each Enterprises unique problems thank

progress through this uh day demo day

118
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,280
thank you Richard let me um ask a couple

119
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,560
of questions again a reminder post your

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,600
questions um in the

121
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:15,320
Q&A and um I'll start with one um some

122
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,919
companies are still trying to figure out

123
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,120
where best to use AI so how would you

124
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,880
work with those

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,919
companies so we we actually spent some

126
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,600
time like working with uh the companies

127
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,560
asking about like what problems they are

128
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,680
trying to solve because like you know AI

129
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
is not about like you know putting a a

130
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,240
technology and just like making it

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
available so you can say I'm using AI

132
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,319
it's about like solving specific

133
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,080
problems in this case we look at like

134
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,039
specific ways of improving productivity

135
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,280
where we see uh that a company like one

136
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,080
of the teams are like you know

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,600
struggling to like meet their goals and

138
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,199
objectives and then we work with them

139
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,120
and we bring liy to like help with

140
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,120
improving that

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,720
productivity and you stay on how does

142
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,759
that what's the bus yeah so so it's a

143
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,639
it's a it's a PL platform that like you

144
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,319
know becomes available it first can be

145
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,240
used by a team and then we we usually

146
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,319
extend it to other teams as as uh you

147
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,120
know people get to see like the value

148
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,039
and then they can you know on board to

149
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,840
that to the platform as well great and

150
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,000
then another question um can you combine

151
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,680
it with other uh communication apps like

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,800
teams and others yes so this is like

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,560
what's really great about like liy like

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,360
light is a platform that connects with

155
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:34,360
multiple ways like teams uh Outlook

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,280
slack and other systems notion and like

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,880
you know whatever you use because like

158
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,280
we know that like communication happens

159
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,000
and uh happens in different ways and we

160
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,000
adapt to each company's unique way of

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,840
communicating okay Richard thank you so

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,639
much and again you can engage further

163
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,759
with Richard in the chat and in the

164
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
breakout rooms
