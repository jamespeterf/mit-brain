1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,360
next speaker is uh Will Oliver. Will is

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
a professor in the department of physics

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
here at MIT and also the department of

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,359
electrical engineering and computer

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,359
science. He is also the director of the

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,000
center for quantum engineering. So let's

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
hear it for Will.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,279
>> Well, good morning. Thanks. Thanks a lot

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
for the invitation to speak today and

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,679
I'm really happy to be here. Um I'm

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,239
going to give a overview of quantum

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,719
computing I guess quantum computing 101

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,440
um foundations frontiers future impact

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
and I would welcome your questions. Uh

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,640
so you know let's make it uh somewhat

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,320
conversational. Um before we get into

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,719
quantum computing quantum technology

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,079
generally addresses three primary

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,480
topics. the sensing of information, the

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,000
networking or communication of that

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,680
information from one place to another,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,800
and then finally the processing of that

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,879
information. And if we had to give it a

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,439
definition, what is quantum technology

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,200
as opposed to just technology or

27
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,960
classical technology as we would call

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,960
it? Um quantum utilizes um quantum

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,880
mechanics at a fundamental level to do

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,400
the sensing, the communicating and the

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
processing.

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,280
And we use it because it can do it in

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,400
ways that are either practically

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,320
prohibitive or even impossible to do

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,560
with our current techniques. So quantum

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,560
enables that. Okay. Then and that's why

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,759
we want to do it.

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,600
Um before we get into quantum though um

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,040
I would like to talk about the last

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
century of classical electronic

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
computing and uh because as as you know

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,119
this quote from Mark Twain, right?

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,920
History doesn't repeat itself, but it

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,759
does often rhyme and and I think that we

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
can learn a lot from this last century.

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
Um, so I won't spend too much time on

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,360
this, but classical electronic computing

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,439
started with um the vacuum tube in 1906.

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,320
Was used for radio transceivers for

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,759
about 40 years, four decades before it

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,399
was finally used in a computer called

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,920
ENIAC that I'm sure we've all heard of,

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,399
uh, developed in the at the University

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,760
of Pennsylvania. The following year, the

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,000
transistor was invented in 1947. But it

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,000
wasn't until the 50s that we had a fully

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
transistor-based computer built here at

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
MIT called TX0.

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
But it didn't look like the computers we

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
have today. It was basically these

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,920
transistors soldered together to make

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
the computer. To get to what we have

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
today, we needed first the integrated

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,000
circuit. That was the late 50s. But even

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,720
with that, it wasn't until the 70s that

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,080
we could actually identify a chip, the

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,920
Intel 404bit processor,

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,840
um, that we would look at and say, "Oh,

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,480
yeah, that that that's an IC, an

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,040
integrated circuit." Even with that, it

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,040
wasn't until the '9s that we had the

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,760
Pentium Pro. I remember using Pentium

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,080
Pro, maybe some of you do, too. Um, five

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,480
bill or five million transistors, and at

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,120
the time that was fantastic. Um, and

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,959
advanced 30 years now to where we are.

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Um, we have GPUs, TPUs, of course, CPUs,

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,360
still XPUs, all sorts of processing

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,319
units. Um, and if you look at the latest

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,120
uh uh Grace Hopper, all right, from from

81
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:19,040
Nvidia, it's um 200 billion transistors

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
on the chip. It's amazing, right? Two

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
chips. Each one has 100 billion

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,080
transistors. Um, and so you think, wow,

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
we're in a good place today, but it took

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,959
us 100 years to get here. That's the

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,720
point. Okay, why did I start with that

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,879
history? Well, because quantum computing

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,000
isn't yet 100 years old. It's actually

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,239
quite nent. It's recent. In the early

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,879
80s, people said, "Look, if you want to

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
simulate a quantum system, maybe we

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,200
should use another quantum system to do

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,360
that because quantum has a lot of

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,799
degrees of freedom." And uh it's hard to

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
simulate. It was hard then, it's still

97
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,519
hard today. By the '9s, people started

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
figuring out what you could do with a

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,920
quantum computer theoretically. For

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,439
example, Shor's algorithm attacks RSA

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,519
crypto systems. We care a lot about

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,040
that. Secure communication. But there

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,640
are many other applications. We'll talk

104
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
about those. Many of them developed in

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,439
the 90s, still being developed today. By

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
2000, we knew, okay, if we could build a

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,840
quantum computer, it will change the

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,239
world. And for the last 25 years, people

109
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,919
like myself and others, I'm a hardware

110
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,160
guy, we're trying to build these quantum

111
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,479
computers. Okay.

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
So, the takeaway is the following. Um,

113
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,000
quantum computing is real. It's

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
transitioning from a scientific

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,680
curiosity to a technical reality that's

116
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,080
happening right now. But the history

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
lesson here is that um advancing from

118
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,759
discovery to useful machines takes time.

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
It takes engineering. It's not going to

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,919
happen overnight. But who here would not

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
have wished that they or their parents

122
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,360
had invested in semiconductor technology

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,919
in the 50s and 60s, right? And look at

124
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,280
where we are today. All right. Um that

125
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,320
means you've got to be in the game to

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,680
play, right? and and so that getting in

127
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,160
the game is happening right now with

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,040
quantum. Uh there's a lot going on

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,199
worldwide. Uh I won't read everything on

130
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,800
here, but a lot of government investment

131
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,720
primarily for the national security

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,880
aspects and the economic security

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,120
aspects of quantum. But what's really

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
changed over the last 10 years, I would

135
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,800
say, is the number of companies that are

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,400
engaging in quantum. A few of them here

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,320
are building quantum computers. Most of

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,240
them here are the picks and shovels that

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
are going to go into enabling quantum

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,800
computers to be built. And then several

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,199
of them are figuring out how to use uh

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,039
quantum computers. And and we have an

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,479
industry membership group with our

144
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,000
center for quantum engineering where

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,120
companies come and work with us to

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,880
figure out how quantum is going to

147
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,080
affect their bottom line uh in the

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
future. And if you'd like to learn more,

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,600
feel free to reach out to me on that

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,400
topic.

151
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,960
Cubits, quantum bits, the fundamental

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,160
logic element of a quantum computer. Um

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,240
they come in two flavors natural atoms

154
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
and then what we call artificial atoms.

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
Natural atoms we all know because we

156
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,479
know the periodic table of elements. We

157
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,199
pick an element an atom. It has energy

158
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,960
levels and electrons and we use those

159
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
energy levels and those electrons to

160
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
represent quantum information. Okay. So

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,759
that those are the natural atomic

162
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
systems. Trapped ions, neutral atoms are

163
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
examples.

164
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,759
But we can also build electrical

165
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,759
circuits from inductors, capacitors and

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,360
junctions, Josephus and junctions and

167
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
assemble them into what looks like a

168
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,240
resonator. And it also has discrete

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,120
energy levels and in many ways looks

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,120
like and behaves like an atom even

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,680
though it comprises

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,440
Avagadro's number worth of atoms inside.

173
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,520
So we're not using the atoms there.

174
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,160
We're using the circuit which itself

175
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,560
behaves like an atom. And there's

176
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,680
actually a whole mendlay of table of

177
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,160
circuits that we can design that'll

178
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,680
afford us this property. So, so quantum

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,319
computers are built from natural atoms

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
uh that nature gives us of course or um

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,520
artificial atoms circuits that we build

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,840
that mimic that behavior.

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,319
Okay, two slides. How's a quantum

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,000
computer different? One um we can do a

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
compare and contrast with a classical

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,120
computer. Classical computers are

187
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,599
transistors. a bit. It's either on or

188
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,080
it's off. Current's flowing or it's not

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,400
flowing. It's like a faucet. We

190
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,039
represent this as a zero or a one. Okay.

191
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,440
Now, it's digital. Discrete states. And

192
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,960
if you measure that transistor, um you

193
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,479
will find it in the state you set it in.

194
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,479
Transistors are almost perfect. So, it's

195
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:35,680
a discrete measurement, deterministic.

196
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,599
Cubits are also two-le systems. This

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,599
state or this state. You pick two of

198
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,639
them and that's your cubit. But the

199
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
difference is that it's quantum

200
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,599
mechanical. And the way that we think

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
about it is you think about it as the

202
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,199
planet Earth. At the north pole is state

203
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,199
zero and at the south pole is state one.

204
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
Now if you're a classical transistor,

205
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,479
you're either at the north pole or the

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,039
south pole. That's your whole world.

207
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,400
That's all you know. But a cubit of

208
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,560
course it can be classical. It can be at

209
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,599
the north pole or the south pole. But it

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
can also be in what's called a

211
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,479
superposition of states zero and one

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,720
simultaneously. And when it's anywhere

213
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,400
other than the north or south pole, it's

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,160
in some combination of zero and one. Now

215
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,240
you're standing at a single place on

216
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,879
Earth. It's a single state. It's a

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,599
single state that carries aspects of

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,199
both zero and one simultaneously. Right?

219
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,360
So that's weird. It's quantum mechanics,

220
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,800
but that's the way it works. One

221
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
consequence though is if you make a

222
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,599
measurement, you'll get a statistical or

223
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,159
probabilistic outcome. So if I'm on the

224
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,599
equator, I'm half zero and half one. I'm

225
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,320
in a superp position state of zero and

226
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
one. But if I make a measurement, I'm

227
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,440
instantly going to go to the north pole.

228
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,719
Oh, I'm state zero. Or I'm instantly

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
going to go to the south pole. I'm state

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,120
one. It's just like flipping a coin.

231
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,279
50/50 which one you get. It might seem,

232
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,680
okay, that's odd. How can I possibly do

233
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,760
something useful with that? Um, well,

234
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,680
yeah, it's true. Encoding information in

235
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,320
a quantum computer is different. It's

236
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,240
part of why it can be powerful.

237
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,200
To give an idea of that power, let's

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,880
consider this. In a classical computer,

239
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,519
if you have a number n transistors,

240
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,680
okay, you can form an exponentially

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,040
large number of states, two to the nth

242
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,600
power. Okay, that sounds great. Except

243
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,320
you can only represent one at a time.

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,560
So, so for example, if you have three

245
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,920
transistors, two to the third power is

246
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,920
eight. I can represent 000. They're all

247
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,920
in zeros. one one all ones and every

248
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,680
permutation in between there are eight

249
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
of them but I can only represent one at

250
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,000
a time. So if some reason for some

251
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,000
reason I wanted to calculate an output

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,160
based on every input I've got two

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,880
choices. I can either take one computer

254
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,959
and feed in one at a time those states

255
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
and get the outputs an exponentially

256
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,279
large number of times. I'm going to be

257
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,200
doing this for a long time. Or I can buy

258
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,120
a very large number of computers and try

259
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
to do it in parallel. All right. But

260
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,560
either way, it's going to take

261
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,760
exponential time or exponential hardware

262
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,320
to do that task. Now, a quantum computer

263
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,920
on the other hand, okay, same. Now, you

264
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,080
have n cubits, two to the nclass states,

265
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,360
north and south pole for each one, but

266
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,920
you can put them all in superp position.

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,440
So, you form one state

268
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,360
00 plus 001 plus plus all the way up to

269
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
111 and you represent all of them in

270
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,320
that state. And what this affords you is

271
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
something called quantum version of

272
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,880
parallelism. And it leverages quantum

273
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,800
interference to do calculations. Now we

274
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,640
haven't made a measurement yet, but this

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
is how a quantum computer drives its

276
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,360
power. Okay. So how do we take advantage

277
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,600
of this? Well, we need algorithms of

278
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,519
course and and many of the algorithms

279
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,200
that we know today were developed by my

280
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,360
colleagues here whose pictures I show at

281
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,600
the bottom here at MIT. MIT was

282
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
foundational in making this happen. Um I

283
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,839
won't read through the whole slide but

284
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,920
the first column of algorithm shows the

285
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,560
major categories where we know quantum

286
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,120
will make a difference. Simulating

287
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,600
quantum systems

288
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,000
factoring that's basically mathematics

289
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,760
that lies behind a lot of our encryption

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,399
schemes. Linear algebra anyone who's an

291
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,480
engineer or an econometricist or

292
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
everybody uses linear algebra

293
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,480
optimization.

294
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,640
Searching unsorted databases. This is

295
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,800
where quantum computers will outperform

296
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,959
classical computers when we can build

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,440
one at a large enough scale. Okay. So,

298
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,519
how do we realize that? And and we'll

299
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
call it commercial quantum advantage.

300
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
You know, quantum advantage would be my

301
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,040
quantum computer does something better

302
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,360
than a classical computer for a problem

303
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,800
that I don't know how to commercialize.

304
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
Commercial quantum advantage is doing

305
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,800
that for something I do know how to

306
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,519
commercialize. And so, first off, there

307
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,240
better be no fast classical algorithm.

308
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
If I know a good classical algorithm, I

309
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,200
should just use those fantastic GPUs

310
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,360
that we've already got to do it right.

311
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Those those they're fantastic machines.

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,320
If I know how to do it efficiently on a

313
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
conventional computer, use a

314
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,839
conventional computer. But there are

315
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,480
many problems where I don't know how to

316
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,079
do that. Okay, number one. Number two,

317
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,760
okay, now I need to figure out a good

318
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,600
quantum algorithm that will solve that

319
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,040
problem. There are lots of problems I'm

320
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
aware of today where I don't know how to

321
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
do it on a classical computer and I also

322
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,200
don't yet know how to do it on a quantum

323
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,880
computer. And and I often say that we

324
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
need more people thinking about the

325
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,959
application space and writing those

326
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
algorithms. That's that's a major part

327
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,160
of what we do in the center for quantum

328
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,000
engineering is work with companies to

329
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,639
figure out an algorithms that's going to

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,480
affect your bottom line. Okay. So then

331
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,480
the third one is it should be a useful

332
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,240
problem. There have been many

333
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
demonstrations of quantum advantage over

334
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
the years that are not commercial

335
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,480
quantum advantage because although they

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,880
prove the point, quantum computers can

337
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
outperform classical computers. They

338
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
don't we don't know how to commercialize

339
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,800
it and therefore we don't know how to

340
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,399
monetize it. If we look at this current

341
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
overlap, it's actually pretty small.

342
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
It's increasing in size, but it's small.

343
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,240
There's a lot of research going on here.

344
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,320
And again, I emphasize that this is the

345
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
major task in addition to building the

346
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,079
hardware.

347
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,760
Now once we have a problem there are a

348
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,639
couple types of advantage that we can

349
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,079
gain from a quantum computer. The first

350
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,920
well before I get into the first one

351
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,079
let's basically what we're talking about

352
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,279
is how big a system how big a computer

353
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,920
do I need or what's the time to get to a

354
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,800
solution or how much energy do I need to

355
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,760
get to a solution right all of these are

356
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,839
important it's not just the speed right

357
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,079
and that's proportional to two factors

358
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,000
one is a polomial in the size of the

359
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,920
computer and the other is exponential in

360
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,720
the size of the computer now the

361
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,399
polomial one is an improvement that a

362
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
quantum computer can make for example if

363
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,519
it took something that goes as n and

364
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,200
made it square root of n that's a big

365
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,959
improvement especially if n is a big

366
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,560
number right time million years take the

367
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,160
square root okay thousand years that's a

368
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,480
big improvement but that pales in

369
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,480
comparison to exponential improvement

370
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,920
and exponential improvement means n is

371
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,760
upstairs and it comes downstairs okay

372
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
and we don't really experience

373
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,880
exponential growth in our everyday lives

374
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,360
and So to give an example of exponential

375
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,440
growth, let's imagine the following.

376
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,000
We're going to use a classical computer,

377
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,880
supercomputer, let's say, um, to

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,120
simulate a quantum computer to do what a

379
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,120
quantum computer can do. And you could

380
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,519
ask, how much memory will I need to

381
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,399
store this quantum state that I told you

382
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,000
about that contains 2 to the n uh,

383
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,399
components?

384
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,279
So if I have 30 cubits, that's 2 to the

385
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,519
30th power. You can do that with a

386
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,120
conventional laptop. Okay, I can store

387
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,760
that in. It takes a lot of memory, but I

388
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,760
can do it. If I just increase it by 20

389
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,720
more cubits, now we have 50 cubits. I

390
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,839
need the top 100 uh supercomputer in the

391
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,399
world. Maybe even the top one.

392
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,480
If I go to just 80 cubits, now we start

393
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
to get into a fantasy where I need to

394
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,120
somehow network all of the computers in

395
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,240
the world and use all of their memory

396
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,959
just to store this quantum state. Double

397
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,519
that to 160. You can go to Wikipedia. 2

398
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,000
to the 160th power is an estimate for

399
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,600
how many silicon atoms we have on Earth.

400
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
And I would need to employ each one as a

401
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,199
me memory element. And now 10 times

402
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,120
where we started at 300 cubits, I now

403
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,399
need all of the atoms in the known

404
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,639
universe and employ each of them

405
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,360
to be a bit of my memory. Okay, to store

406
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,519
this massive state. Now, okay, that's

407
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,839
exponential growth, right? It's almost

408
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,160
unbelievable. Of course the challenge is

409
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,480
utilizing it for commercial quantum

410
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,720
advantage.

411
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,880
So why don't we have quantum computers

412
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,000
right now at large scale? It comes down

413
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,920
to two times. One is the coherence time

414
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,560
and one is the gate time. So let's take

415
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,639
them one at a time. So the coherence

416
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,000
time is how long cubits remain quantum

417
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,079
mechanical. I can start at say time t

418
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,920
equals z. I've set up my computer and I

419
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,120
let it run and I'm I'm running my

420
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,720
algorithm on it. But as I'm doing that,

421
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,279
everything else in that computer's

422
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,920
environment is creating noise and

423
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,639
conspiring against me to take those

424
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,639
cubits to a different place. And so

425
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,240
these environmental disruptions over

426
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,480
time, you can think of it as blurring

427
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,880
the quantum state and eventually it's

428
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,279
lost. Now the cubits didn't disappear.

429
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,440
They're still there. But the state that

430
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,199
they ended up in which is the answer to

431
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,160
my problem and I'm trying to go from

432
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,240
point A to point B on the way there the

433
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,959
noise is taking me to some other point C

434
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,040
and I get a wrong answer right the time

435
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,759
frame over which that happens is called

436
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,680
the coherence time

437
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,759
second time is called the gate time

438
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,440
that's basically I have an algorithm it

439
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,399
has a large number of steps how long

440
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,720
does it take me to do each step right

441
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,040
and and the figure of merit then is how

442
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,519
many steps can I

443
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,720
before this environment overcomes my

444
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,720
quantum computer. Right?

445
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,839
With that, we can start thinking about

446
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,280
different types of cubit platforms and

447
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,079
modalities. There are lots of candidate

448
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,319
technologies. And

449
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,919
I won't talk in too much detail about

450
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,919
them individually, but what I want to

451
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,720
show is how they compare to one another

452
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,120
on this chart. The left vertical axis is

453
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,760
how many steps I can take before things

454
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,520
fall apart and the right axis is

455
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,000
basically one to one in that we call it

456
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,600
fidelity. So one error in a 100 gates is

457
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,360
99%. One error in a thousand 99.9% etc.

458
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,080
So you want as high a fidelity as

459
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,640
possible. The horizontal axis is just

460
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,640
the gate speed. How fast can I take

461
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,120
those steps in hertz? Think of it as

462
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,400
your computer's clock speed. So the

463
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,480
upper right corner is where the best

464
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,880
performance is. And some of the major

465
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
players today, one is called a trapped

466
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,280
ion. That's a natural atom. It's held in

467
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,240
space and operations are performed on

468
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,160
it. They have decent fidelities. They're

469
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
trying to go faster. I work on

470
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,400
superconducting cubits. We're pretty

471
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,000
fast. We want higher fidelity, right?

472
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
That's what we're working on. Neutral

473
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
atoms, another upand cominging

474
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,679
technology. They're sort of in between,

475
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,840
right? So there's no clear winner right

476
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,919
now. And if I think about the history of

477
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,960
classical electronic computing, there

478
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,960
won't be a winner necessarily.

479
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,520
We started with vacuum tubes. We went to

480
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,520
bipolar junction transistors that became

481
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,440
too power hungry. We went to emitter

482
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,120
coupled logic that became too power

483
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,440
hungry. We went to cos right we then you

484
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,360
know the dinard scaling ended moors laws

485
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
ended. So what did we do? Well we went

486
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,480
to GPUs we 3D integrated right?

487
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,039
Heterogeneous integration right? quantum

488
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:46,520
computing very likely will evolve in the

489
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,520
same or a similar way. Okay,

490
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,120
just to show that there's so many

491
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,039
different modalities here,

492
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,600
superconducting, trapped ion, photonics,

493
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,039
silicon, etc. And all the companies uh

494
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,480
that are trying to do that, many of them

495
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,200
are blue chips, a lot of them are

496
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,200
startups. One of them, Atlantic Quantum,

497
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,760
under the superconducting, is a startup

498
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,000
uh that spun out of my group here, and

499
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,200
we're all trying to commercialize uh

500
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,120
this technology, make it

501
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,720
commercializable.

502
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,960
This is what quantum computers look like

503
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,480
today. On the lower left is IBM's

504
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,559
Osprey. This is about a 430ish

505
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,480
cubit machine. You can see that it's 3D

506
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,640
integrated. That 3D integration

507
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,280
technology developed here at MIT and

508
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,799
Lincoln Lab. In the upper left, Google's

509
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,480
Willow chip. This is 100 cubits, but

510
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,400
last fall they demonstrated quantum

511
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,000
error correction scaling for the first

512
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,480
time. Major demonstration. I'll show

513
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,840
that in just a moment. Upper middle is

514
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,880
Qeras. Aquila, that is a neutral atom

515
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,840
quantum computer. Uh, and it spun out of

516
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,000
Harvard and MIT. Quantinum, that's a

517
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,640
trapped ion. The lower right D-wave,

518
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,160
that's a quantum analer. Uh, and in the

519
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,919
bottom middle, of course, that's not a

520
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,200
quantum computer. uh you'll recognize

521
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,039
that as the right flyer. Um wasn't the

522
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,960
first time humankind flown. We often say

523
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,240
that but it's not true. We had hot air

524
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,360
balloons. Okay, we had gliders, aerod

525
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,679
drromes, right?

526
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,520
But what did this event show? It was the

527
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,960
first time that it all came together

528
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,160
that you got a person on board,

529
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,080
self-propelled, it took off, it landed.

530
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,760
And I put this picture here because I

531
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,440
think that all of these technologies

532
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,280
that you're looking at, they're

533
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,400
basically at this level of development.

534
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,559
It's very early days, but we look back

535
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,640
at that right flyer and we say that was

536
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,960
the dawn of commercial aviation because

537
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,520
that's when it all came together. And I

538
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,039
as I look at these quantum technologies,

539
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,120
okay, my opinion, but I look at these

540
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,799
quantum technologies and I think, yeah,

541
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,799
we're at the dawn of commercial quantum

542
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,960
computing. It's going to happen. It may

543
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,960
take 10 or 20 or 30 years, but it is

544
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,240
coming.

545
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, so there's a lot of promise, but

546
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,159
to realize that promise, we need to

547
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,320
engineer systems that are much larger

548
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
than this. They have to be robust. Okay,

549
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,840
we'd like to have a fuselage on the

550
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,679
plane and put some seats, have some

551
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,440
people in the front, right? We need to

552
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,440
do the equivalent of that for quantum

553
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,159
computers. Okay, and one of the biggest

554
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,120
challenges we face, a grand challenge is

555
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,960
called quantum error correction. Um,

556
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,000
these cubits are quantum mechanical and

557
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,120
they're faulty and they fall apart after

558
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,480
say a thousand or 10,000 operations. You

559
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
could then ask, that's what's in the

560
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,559
yellow. By the way, we call them

561
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,960
physical cubits. They're the physical

562
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,080
embodiment of a cubit.

563
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
You could ask what do you need for

564
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,120
commercial advantage? How many

565
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,960
operations?

566
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,720
Probably 1 billion to one trillion

567
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
operations. So, we can do about a

568
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,400
thousand and you need to be at a billion

569
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,679
or a trillion. So, how are you going to

570
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,520
get from where we are today to that?

571
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
Well, my students work very hard at

572
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,640
improving cubits and we've been doing

573
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,679
that for years and we'll continue to do

574
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
that. But I don't think we're going to

575
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,600
make up a factor million with material

576
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,120
science, right? Fortunately, we don't

577
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,720
have to do that. Thanks to Peter Shore

578
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,120
and his colleagues, we know how to do

579
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,480
quantum error correction and that's how

580
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,799
we're going to get beyond this gap. By

581
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
the way, transistors, why are they

582
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,400
ubiquitous? Because they're almost

583
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,760
perfect. The error rate of a transistor

584
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,440
is one part in 10^ the 20th power.

585
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,039
Right? Almost never fails. If this

586
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,360
crashes right now, almost certainly the

587
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,640
software, not the hardware. Fortunately,

588
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,120
we don't have to be there. We just need

589
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,039
to be in the blue region. And the

590
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,320
concept of error correction is something

591
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,240
we're all familiar with. We form teams.

592
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,159
That's basically it. Rather than using

593
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,080
one cubit to encode the information,

594
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,240
we're going to form a team of cubits. In

595
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,080
this case, nine cubits. You can see the

596
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,400
yellow ones. There are nine of them on

597
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,240
the right. We call that a logical cubit.

598
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
It represents one cubit's worth of

599
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,640
information, but it has nine physical

600
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,400
cubits to do it. And the classical

601
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,080
version of this is majority voting. You

602
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,320
basically ask, "How many of you think

603
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm in state zero versus how many think

604
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,320
I'm state one?" And you majority vote.

605
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,720
And so that's the concept. You'll you'll

606
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,280
also see some blue ones there. Those

607
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,039
blue ones are basically the referees.

608
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,400
They got a yellow card and a red card.

609
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,240
In fact, they have three cards in this

610
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,440
game. And when they one of their

611
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,240
neighbors has an error, they're going to

612
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,600
throw up a flag. And me as the operator

613
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,080
at room temperature is going to look at

614
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,000
that flag and say, "Ah, one of the

615
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,679
neighbors has an error." And by looking

616
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,559
at all of the referees and the errors

617
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,480
they flag, I can determine which cubit,

618
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,720
which physical cubit had an error, and I

619
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,600
can go back and fix it. This is almost

620
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,440
magic. It's not magic, but it's amazing.

621
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,679
What's amazing about it is we all learn

622
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,440
that I can never measure the physical

623
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,919
cubits. If I do, I destroy the quantum

624
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,080
information. I make them classical, but

625
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,320
I never measure a cubit. I I just

626
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,919
measure those referees,

627
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,520
right? And that's how I protect quantum

628
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,840
information.

629
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,159
Now, of course, none of this comes for

630
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,880
free. If you look at the error rate of

631
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:54,240
the logical cubit, um it goes as this

632
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,200
formula. There's a C. C stands for cost.

633
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,799
It's not free. If you form a team, of

634
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,280
course, it's not as easy as just having

635
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,919
one person there, right? We know this in

636
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,000
companies, right? Google has 150,000

637
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,000
employees, right? And they're not all

638
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,760
working on the internet or AI. You got

639
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,559
an HR department, you've got a security

640
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,360
department, etc., etc., etc., but you

641
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,279
still do it because we know that by

642
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,880
forming teams that are focused on the

643
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,640
product and all of the stuff and the

644
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
cost that goes around it, it still

645
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,000
provides advantage, right? That's the

646
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,520
concept of a logical cubit. And as you

647
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,760
make the team bigger and bigger, it

648
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,559
becomes more and more performant. How

649
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,400
much more performant? exponentially. So

650
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,720
what we're seeing on the right here, the

651
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,480
vertical axis is the logical error.

652
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,120
That's the error rate of the logical

653
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,360
cubit on a log scale.

654
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,039
The vertical axis is the error rate of

655
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,120
the individuals,

656
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,640
individual cubits, and that's not on a

657
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,039
log scale. So one in a th00and is uh you

658
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,360
know just to the left of 0.15%. That's

659
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,400
basically where we're at now. And you

660
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,919
could ask then how does this scale with

661
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,919
the size of the team? Well, that's the

662
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,320
different colors. Distance three is

663
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:10,559
jargon, but it means 17 cubits. Distance

664
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:13,520
5 is 49 cubits, etc. If I go from 17 to

665
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,840
49 cubits, I get this improvement here.

666
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,679
Lambda is the is the what we call it,

667
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,919
but from three to distance three to

668
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,679
distance five. If I go to one size

669
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,520
larger, distance seven, my error rate

670
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,000
goes down. And notice each time it goes

671
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,440
down by about a factor 10. I can keep

672
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,640
doing that. I just keep making the team

673
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,919
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger

674
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
and bigger and bigger and eventually I

675
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,520
just make it big enough that I achieve

676
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,679
the error rate that I want. And here we

677
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,919
are down at one part in a billion. You

678
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,840
could ask, okay, distance 17, that

679
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,159
sounds like a big team. How big is that

680
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,480
team?

681
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:50,159
577 cubits. So I increased from one by a

682
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,960
factor 577 and my error rate went down

683
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,440
by a factor 1 million.

684
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,840
Exponential growth again, right? This is

685
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,919
how we're going to overcome these

686
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,159
errors. The demonstration last fall from

687
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,320
Google is shown here. And what you're

688
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,559
looking at is the logical error rate

689
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,039
versus how many times they did the error

690
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,799
correction, the error detection. And in

691
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,039
red is the uh distance three curve. And

692
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,720
when they went to distance five, they

693
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,039
added more cubits. It goes down to the

694
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,200
teal curve. They go to distance seven,

695
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,159
it goes down to the dark blue curve.

696
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,559
Down is better. Less error per cycle.

697
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,039
And in fact, if you look at this just

698
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,039
above the teal, I think it's in green,

699
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,640
that's the best physical cubit. That's

700
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,559
the best team member. There's always a

701
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,600
best one on your soccer team, the one

702
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,840
who's the star. This is the star cubit.

703
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,720
And the team at distance five was

704
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,640
already better than the best star on the

705
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,720
team. And of course, distance 7 even

706
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
better still, right? This is common

707
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,559
sense, right? We know that forming teams

708
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,320
will always if if they're good, they

709
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,679
will always outperform any individual on

710
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,760
the team.

711
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,760
So Google quantum AI demonstrated this

712
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,000
last fall. This will be remembered for

713
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,120
decades. Um it's a major demonstration.

714
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,520
It shows that we can achieve um quantum

715
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,679
resilience.

716
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,679
Now many of you may have seen this in

717
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,320
January. Um of course this is Jensen

718
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,919
Hong um and he's being interviewed. Um

719
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,440
and he was asked when are we going to

720
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,120
have a quantum computer? And he said

721
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,799
well you know 15 years seems a little

722
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,799
early. 30 years that seems a little

723
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,480
long. I think most of us would agree 20

724
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,799
years. And of course all the stocks

725
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,000
tanked from the quantum computing

726
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:32,080
companies that had IPOed. Um and

727
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,880
come back in June and he was like okay

728
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,799
wait a minute. Um what I meant to say

729
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,720
was that we're actually reaching an

730
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,880
inflection point. I I think these two

731
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,640
things are equivalent. Basically when

732
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,240
Jensen was asked when are we going to

733
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
have a quantum computer? He's thinking,

734
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,559
"When are we going to have the quantum

735
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
computer that's fully performant and

736
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,520
it's going to help me design new

737
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,880
pharmaceutical drugs?" Right? He's

738
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,559
thinking of the endgame. And he said,

739
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,000
"20 years." I thought that was

740
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,279
fantastic. A lot of a lot of people

741
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,760
complain, "Oh, Jensen, you're killing

742
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,039
the industry." No way. We have we have

743
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,880
the, to my mind, one of the smartest

744
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,919
engineers

745
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,559
in industry today saying we are going to

746
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,080
have the endgame quantum computer in 20

747
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,600
years. That's fantastic. from my mind.

748
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,799
Stocks all recovered by the way since

749
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,960
then. So, and and more if you follow it.

750
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,760
Um, I just want to say that we have this

751
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,039
industry engagement group here at MIT.

752
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,559
If you'd like to learn more, feel free

753
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,480
to contact me. Number of companies

754
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,559
involved. Um, we also do a lot of

755
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,919
entrepreneurship here at MIT. I

756
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,600
mentioned Atlantic Quantum, my own

757
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,840
company, but uh, and also Cuera, the um,

758
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,440
neutral atom company. Labber Quantum

759
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,360
spun out of my um, group a couple years

760
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,159
ago. That's a software company. Anyways,

761
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,480
lots of companies uh are spinning out of

762
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,320
MIT as well. And um again, if you'd like

763
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,640
to learn more about what's happening in

764
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,679
the industrial space uh in quantum, feel

765
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,240
free to contact me. So today's reality,

766
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,960
and this is I think the last slide. One,

767
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,520
quantum computers will not replace

768
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,279
conventional classical computers, right?

769
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,279
Quantum computers solve certain problems

770
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,840
really well, but they're not going to do

771
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,760
Microsoft Word. um for for a lot of

772
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,279
these applications, they're no better

773
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,440
than a classical computer. They can do

774
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,600
it, but why would you go to the trouble

775
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,840
when we've got really good classical

776
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,080
computers already?

777
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,720
Um we need more quantum algorithms. We

778
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,799
talked about that already, but you know,

779
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,840
one of our main jobs going forward is to

780
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,440
find commercially viable applications.

781
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,919
Um

782
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,360
RSA sounds scary that quantum computers

783
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,279
can break it and we got to pay

784
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,240
attention, but it's not going to happen

785
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,120
today. to break RSA encryption public

786
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,200
key crypto systems is going to require a

787
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,360
very large error corrected quantum

788
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,880
computer with millions of cubits that's

789
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,960
still a ways away but but we need to

790
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,520
switch over to a new crypto system now

791
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,279
postquantum crypto NIST announced it

792
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,440
last year goes by names like Kyber okay

793
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,520
um why do we need to do that for forward

794
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,720
security there's there's information

795
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,039
that we are encrypting today that we

796
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,760
want to retain security over not just

797
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,559
today but in 10 years, 20 years, 30

798
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,399
years, right? And at some point we will

799
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,600
have a quantum computer that can decrypt

800
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,919
everything that we're storing on hard

801
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,520
drives today. Okay? Um and we will need

802
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,279
quantum error correction to make this

803
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,600
possible. And I think with the

804
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,080
demonstration from Google last fall, we

805
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,159
saw uh a major step in that direction.

806
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,559
And so that I'd like to thank you uh for

807
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,559
your attention. Any question?

808
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,559
Questions for Will.

809
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,320
>> Hey, thank you, Will. I wanted to ask uh

810
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
we're chatting just before um when you

811
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,600
envision uh where these quantum

812
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,520
computers are going. I'm Bruce Hack by

813
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,240
the way from Myithril Technologies uh

814
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,159
and data center days. So what um paint a

815
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
picture for us in 20 years when these

816
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,840
first uh workable quantum computers are

817
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,440
in practice. uh where will they be and

818
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,039
how will another question that came up

819
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
this morning in conversation is cities

820
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,480
you know if cities got changed by the

821
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,559
automobile and they got changed by the

822
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,360
introduction of the airport as you said

823
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,440
commercial aviation what does the uh

824
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,919
future of and maybe not just today's

825
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,919
data centers but that 20-year trajectory

826
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,159
from today to quantum computers what

827
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,360
does this mean for us as humans and the

828
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,600
future of our cities

829
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,320
>> yeah so so first part is that quantum

830
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,559
computers absolutely as far as I can

831
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,799
tell uh need to run in tandem with a

832
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,200
very large classical computer, right?

833
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,960
And so our data centers will have of

834
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,559
course the classical racks that we all

835
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,399
know today, but next to them will be

836
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,760
quantum computers because the quantum

837
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,039
computers that are doing this error

838
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,279
correction, they need those classical

839
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,440
compute and that classical compute power

840
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,279
just to interpret what the referees are

841
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,519
telling us where the errors occur. So

842
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,039
and and plus some of these computers are

843
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,399
very cold and if I am writing an

844
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,480
algorithm I want to do that at room

845
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,880
temperature on a classical computer and

846
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,480
you know so for very practical reasons

847
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,640
quantum computers will always run in

848
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,799
tandem with with conventional classical

849
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,039
computers and in fact many of the

850
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,360
algorithms will leverage that classical

851
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,440
computer as well. So a large a part of

852
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,440
that algorithm may run on the classical

853
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,120
data center computer but then it gets to

854
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,360
a hard part and then it's going to hand

855
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,679
that off to the accelerator the quantum

856
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,000
computer gets the answer back. So it's

857
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,360
and you know the future I don't have a

858
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,919
crystal ball of course but there are

859
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,799
some pretty thorny problems facing

860
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,840
humankind today and and energy is a big

861
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,600
one. Climate change is another one.

862
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,159
We're living through this now right? Do

863
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,399
we, you know, do we abandon fossil fuels

864
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,399
um knowing that that's going to wreck

865
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,200
the economy so that we can have a

866
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,640
cleaner future or do we buy ourselves

867
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,960
some time so that we can find solutions

868
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,880
to this problem and then implement them?

869
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,600
I don't have the answers, but I think

870
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
that one step towards this um is quantum

871
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,320
computers because where they really

872
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,200
shine is in simulating um quantum

873
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,399
chemistries, some better batteries, um

874
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,559
quantum materials, better materials, and

875
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,600
engineers can use this this information

876
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,360
then to develop the technologies that

877
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,919
hopefully will allow us to live in a

878
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,919
cleaner environment.

879
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,159
>> Great. All right. Thank you, Will. Okay.

880
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,159
Thank you. Terrific.
