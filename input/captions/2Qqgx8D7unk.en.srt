00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:02,702
(regal music)

2
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,229
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:19,964
(Professor Wallace laughing)

4
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:26,218
(upbeat music continues)

5
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:30,692
(wheels squeaking)

6
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:36,404
(upbeat music ends)

7
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:40,050
(cheerful music)
(students chatting)

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,933
- When we feel valued,
we do our best work.

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,243
When we feel supported, we
have the courage to take risks.

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,560
And when we empower
others, we unlock potential

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,160
that they may not have even
realized they possessed.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,690
Hello, I'm a professor in
mechanical engineering design.

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,860
A teacher.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,180
And more than anything, my
goal is to inspire students

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,520
with the confidence to dream big,

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,670
to be good, and to feel good.

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,333
I want to help students be better than me.

18
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:19,461
(cheerful music intensifies)

19
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,461
(audience cheering)

20
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,260
(cheerful music continues)
(audience continues cheering)

21
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:40,575
(cheerful music continues)
(audience continues cheering)

22
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:46,354
I want to make students' stars shine.

23
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:52,203
(playful music)
(students conversing)

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,290
At MIT in my design
class, our number one job

25
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,240
is to provide opportunities

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,913
for each student's star to shine bright.

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,480
So in the class we do that, of course,

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,030
at our final prototype launch,

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,710
our presentations.

30
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,090
Where each team of students

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,430
will present their ideas on stage

32
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,030
in front of thousands of people.

33
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:23,233
(audience cheering)
(playful music continues)

34
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,780
It's the culmination

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,370
of everything they've worked towards

36
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,128
throughout the entire course.

37
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:31,795
And that's no small undertaking.

38
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,440
- [Student] Yeah, you can.

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,770
- So how do we adequately equip them

40
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,070
for such a pivotal moment?

41
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:44,700
(groovy music)
(students conversing)

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,840
Leading up to launch day,

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,050
there's been a consistent and
steady stream of encouragement

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,123
and support every step of the way.

45
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,123
And that's just the bare minimum.

46
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,170
(groovy music continues)

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,520
In the Pappalardo Lab,

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
where most of their physical work

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,300
and prototyping takes place,

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,000
we ensure that each student
has all the materials,

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,460
machinery, and tools that
they could possibly need

52
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,900
right at their fingertips

53
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,000
in order to explore and follow ideas.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,460
(groovy music continues)

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,780
We provide a framework for the
product development journey.

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,560
We provide resources for
students to develop skills.

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,800
We provide students with
ways to make decisions

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,930
and develop consensus.

59
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,320
We help students learn
to prepare and practice.

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,990
(groovy music continues)

61
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,160
We critique, and many
times we support in ways

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,280
that students may never even realize.

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,272
Things just appear.

64
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:46,410
(groovy music continues)

65
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,113
- Let me make this change real quick.

66
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,430
- For example, in 2023,
Red Team worked on a robot

67
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,860
that drove on train rails

68
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,090
and washed the rails so the
trains don't lose traction.

69
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,360
So we're thinking, "Well,
how are we gonna test that?

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,307
How are they gonna do it for real?"

71
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,830
(upbeat music)

72
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,900
So even while they were
just thinking about

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,820
their early stage design,

74
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,710
we were sourcing train tracks

75
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,360
and building a miniature

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,740
but full scale railroad so
they could test their device

77
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,573
and learn.

78
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,980
For Green Team,

79
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,750
we installed a wave pool

80
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,050
so they could test their
water safety product for real,

81
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,073
on balmy winter days.

82
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:33,749
(upbeat music continues)

83
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:36,570
(water splashes)

84
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,120
We do this for all of our students.

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,370
There are countless examples like these,

86
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,370
big and small, throughout
the journey of the semester.

87
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,750
But in no uncertain manner,

88
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,810
the students own their own journey.

89
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,000
Teams make their own decisions.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,490
They decide and are
responsible for what they do.

91
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,490
(upbeat music ends)
(engine rumbling)

92
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,806
(students conversing)

93
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:14,341
(gentle music)

94
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,700
We want to make a student's star shine

95
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,120
because ultimately it's going
to be them out there on stage

96
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,460
presenting the products they've designed,

97
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,800
and it will be them
out there in the world,

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,563
in their careers far beyond the classroom.

99
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:33,960
(gentle music continues)

100
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,870
So in order to do that, we
give them the opportunity

101
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,880
to own their journeys.

102
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,213
We empower them to make
the decisions themselves.

103
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,230
We try to instill in them
a sense of confidence

104
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,020
and self-worth by letting
them take the lead

105
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,973
and drive their paths forward.

106
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,450
That way, when they get
to the end of our course

107
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,760
and ultimately get out into the world,

108
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,650
they'll have all the tools

109
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,803
and skills needed to
confidently make a difference.

110
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,740
(gentle music continues)

111
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,060
So how do we apply this? How
do we make others' stars shine?

112
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,390
Well, in a sense, it's
really about being generous,

113
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,270
about giving opportunity and support,

114
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,310
and letting people grow

115
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,000
and make their own choices to have control

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,890
of what they're doing.

117
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,750
So feel the warmth of
making others' stars shine.

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,800
A team of us is stronger
than any one of us.

119
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,345
Until then, keep playing seriously.

120
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:40,345
(gentle music continues)
(audience cheering)

121
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:49,812
(gentle music continues)
(audience continues cheering)
