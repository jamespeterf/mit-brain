1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,043
I always knew that I wanted to solve very

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,921
important problems that affect society.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,716
And I'd read a book by Benjamin Carson

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,050
called "Gifted Ants."

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,719
And you know, that was a really big deal.

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,596
So at the point I thought I wanted to be

7
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,014
a neurosurgeon just because

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,641
Ben Carson was a real soldier.

9
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,977
But as I grew older, I realized that

10
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,603
there are other very important problems

11
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,647
in society that requires attention.

12
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,275
By the time I got into college, I knew

13
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,777
that I was attracted to solving problems

14
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,362
that are related to energy.

15
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,283
I'm originally from Nigeria, from a

16
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,285
little fishing town called Badagri.

17
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,290
One of those towns in Lagos that has its

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,791
own language, its own culture.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,127
It's a little town that holds a lot of

20
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,045
history about Nigeria.

21
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,304
I was a very curious child.

22
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,014
I really liked to ask

23
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,098
the why questions.

24
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,725
Why do things exist?

25
00:00:59,267 --> 00:00:59,976
Those are the things that

26
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,311
were more important to me.

27
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,979
And even as a 10-year-old, I

28
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,314
was more into reading books.

29
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,483
So my friends would call me "bookworm."

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,236
As a child, the US was like the place you

31
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,279
really want to go to.

32
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,698
The only way I get to go there was always

33
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,866
just reading the books.

34
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,327
It seems like that was like the frontiers

35
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,620
of civilization, right?

36
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,623
It was where the most important discovery

37
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,583
has been made and it was

38
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,918
really pushing the frontiers.

39
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,919
So it was like this

40
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,961
place that looks like heaven.

41
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,050
When I went to college, I knew I was more

42
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,259
interested in energy-related

43
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,886
types of problems to solve.

44
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,513
Because in Nigeria, we have

45
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,848
shortage when it comes to energy.

46
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,352
So it's very normal that you don't get 24

47
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,686
hours supply of electricity.

48
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,481
Those became problems that I care so much

49
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,233
about that I would like to solve.

50
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,985
As I went on, I realized that when it

51
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,112
comes to the density of

52
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,739
energy you can get from, say,

53
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,117
a solar cell versus nuclear energy.

54
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,702
Nuclear energy tops that.

55
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,373
I then pivoted to focusing on generating

56
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,416
energy from nuclear reactors

57
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,627
and making them technology that can be

58
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,255
adopted in the African societies.

59
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,173
I was finished in college.

60
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,259
I told my friends that I

61
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,677
really like to go to MIT.

62
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,638
But I couldn't do some more the courage

63
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,598
to submit an application, you know.

64
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,352
When I finished my PhD, I moved to New

65
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,271
York to Brookhaven National Lab.

66
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,188
I suppose then I

67
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,356
became a staff scientist.

68
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,608
And I really thought my career was just

69
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,609
going to be over there

70
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,778
because I really enjoyed it.

71
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,949
But it turns out that a place like MIT is

72
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,117
where you could also do

73
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,661
research that you care about.

74
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,120
You can do the

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,371
science that you care about.

76
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,539
When the opportunity came to

77
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,625
move to MIT, I asked myself,

78
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,460
"What else can I do that

79
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm not doing at Brookhaven?"

80
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,339
And it turns out that I have questions,

81
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,341
science questions in my mind

82
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,635
that I've always cared about.

83
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,929
And I tell my students that what I do, I

84
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,972
don't see it as a job.

85
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,432
I see it as a calling.

86
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,060
And so when I get up every day, solving

87
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,103
this problem is what

88
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,605
is always in my mind.
