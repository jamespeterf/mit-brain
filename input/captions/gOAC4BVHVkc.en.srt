1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,480
large language models like chat GPT the

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,400
open source varieties are rotten Liars

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,200
cannot trust them the reason is they're

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,360
all sequence-based they've been trained

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,760
on the world's data and they're looking

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,400
at patterns sequences of characters to

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,960
determine what someone is saying and

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,960
then spits out the sequence of

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,480
characters on the other side to try to

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,679
Plate you and give you the answer that

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,759
you were looking for unfortunately it's

12
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:32,640
not based on logical reasoning it's just

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,120
B based on these sequences they are very

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
much

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,640
probabilistic um one of the issues here

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,840
is that when we're trying to use these

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,360
in corporate settings in government

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,199
settings we BR we bring them into

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,680
workflows where we have to or want to

20
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:52,520
trust them so what we have done is

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,719
embraced various techniques that address

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,600
this problem the most popular one today

23
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,760
the all the rage in the AI Community is

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,040
this so-called rag technique which

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,159
stands for retrieval augmented

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,000
generation and what it's doing is

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,520
bringing representative data into the

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,840
mix as opposed to using the vanilla

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,880
large language model it's giving you

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,640
representative data as little nuggets of

31
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,640
information relevant to the task at hand

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,079
relevant to the use case relevant to the

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,520
domain that this particular model is

34
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,640
working within uh it's kind of like a

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,720
clue toward the right answer and it

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,000
increases the probability

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,119
that it will give you a good answer but

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,759
there are no assurances it does not give

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,159
you proof that you can trust this output

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,399
so what we're focused on is number four

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,079
here symbolic reasoning tried and true

42
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,960
been around for decades um we are the

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,640
bridge between the very powerful large

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,399
language models very creative they can

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,719
as they describe it hallucinate come up

46
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,640
with fabricated responses what we're

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,320
doing is taking that natural language

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,079
and turning it into a mathematical

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,800
problem something that can be solved for

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,680
think back to Geometry where you had a

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,000
formal proof and you showed every step

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
of your process every claim that went

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,720
into the answer and there was only one

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,879
answer at the end this is the same thing

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,319
that we're doing here we take the

56
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,680
natural language we turn it into a

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,160
domain specific language powered program

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,519
that gets run through these

59
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,040
off-the-shelf so-called solvers solvers

60
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,599
are saying yes or no it does or doesn't

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,280
meet all the constraints and assertions

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,040
and known facts that you're imposing

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,800
upon

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,080
it the way we do this is we bring it

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,120
into a knowledge graph we turn the

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
natural language sequence of characters

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,920
into a graph structure that aligns to

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,879
The Domain that we're working within

69
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,400
it's a process that has a human in the

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,319
loop so we can get feedback and

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,159
constantly improve the models and has a

72
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,239
path toward this more trusted age a and

73
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,799
that's really the value is that bring it

74
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,760
into use cases where people are

75
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,640
reluctant to use it say clinical

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,560
decision support for healthcare or in

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,120
the claims adjudication process for

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,440
insurance or picking the right portfolio

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,799
in financial

80
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,599
services or with us we've started with

81
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,159
the Department of Defense where they

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,519
have lots of data that needs to be

83
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,799
properly classified meaning which

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,799
security level can uh this particular

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,239
piece of data fall into what label

86
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,799
should we apply to this particular email

87
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,879
what marking should we put on this

88
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,680
particular report and everything is

89
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,400
driven by these security classification

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,879
guides which are documents that were

91
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,879
written by humans for humans never

92
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,040
intended for AI to interpret so we're

93
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,400
breaking that down into constraints and

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,439
rules that we can apply in near real

95
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,959
time to new data coming into our

96
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,480
environment we have a number of projects

97
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,640
with theod we're working across Ross the

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,840
intelligence Community as well we are

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,840
intentionally now focused on bringing it

100
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,280
to the commercial sector we have use

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,400
cases as I've already mentioned in

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,159
financial Ser Services Insurance life

103
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,600
sciences and health care we are eager to

104
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,639
find Pilots we would love to work on

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,919
collaborative development efforts with

106
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,400
anyone that wants to perhaps white label

107
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:26,000
the solution and for partners that want

108
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,080
to help us bring this into the the

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
industries that we feel make the most

110
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,960
sense which are us usually regulated

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,160
Industries ones that have laws and

112
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,400
regulations that have to be adhered to

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,960
that we can use as guidelines for the

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,639
processing of this new information

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,280
coming in so you can find me at at

116
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:51,560
jackson. or email me directly Scott

117
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,960
jackson. and I'll be outside thank you

118
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,960
thank you Scott
