1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:05,240
great thanks Chris really appreciate the

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,720
introduction and uh great great to see

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,840
uh so many people here um really a

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,480
pleasure to tell you about Quantum

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,560
Computing let me get right to it because

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,600
we've only got about 20 minutes

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,880
um want to wish MTL first off a happy

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,039
40th and um you know Tomas is doing a

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,960
great job also want to recognize Jesus

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,000
who helped us get this Center for

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,480
Quantum engineering off the ground um

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
and so I think it's appropriate before

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,399
we get into Quantum to think about

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,600
classical electronic Computing um the

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,680
vacuum tube was invented in 1906

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,079
originally used for radio transceivers

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,320
um and it was about 40 years before it

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,559
saw its way into um a computer called

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,640
eniac uh 1946 uh the following year the

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,920
transistor was invented and within about

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,199
10 years we had a fully transistor-based

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,320
computer called tx0 developed here at

23
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:00,519
MIT uh but it basically had transistors

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,399
soldered together

25
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,800
to get closer to our chips today we

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,479
needed the integrated circuit in the

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,000
late 50s but it wasn't until the 70s

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,320
that we saw chips like the Intel 44 uh

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,200
4bit processor 2000

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
transistors um you'd have to go to the

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,200
90s to get to a chip that I remember

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,720
using maybe some of you do too called

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,880
the Pentium Pro with millions of

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,159
transistors and then another 25 30 years

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,240
to get to where we are today multi-core

36
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:33,200
processors gpus CPUs xus tpus

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,640
um approaching a 100 billion transistors

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,040
this this technology is really really

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,399
fantastic but it took a hundred years to

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,159
get from the fundamental discoveries out

41
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,399
to where we are today and we should keep

42
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,119
that in mind when we think about Quantum

43
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,520
Computing and Quantum Computing um

44
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,320
started in the 1980s it's relatively new

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
um Richard feeman and others suggested

46
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,920
that if you want to simulate or emulate

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,200
a Quantum system you should use another

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,880
quantum system to do it because it's

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,039
really hard for conventional computers

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,719
to do that that was true in the 1980s

51
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,440
and it's still true today and people

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,360
thought about you know what does this

53
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,000
actually mean within about 10 years we

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,160
had a lot of the theoretical algorithms

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,599
uh that underpin Quantum Computing uh

56
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,760
perhaps the most famous is Shores

57
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,440
algorithm for Crypt analysis but also

58
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,920
Quantum analing adiabatic Quantum

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,000
Computing Etc that was the mid90s fast

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,160
forward to today 30 years later we do

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,959
have quantum computers they're just very

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,400
small you can access them in the cloud

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,040
and um you know use them to test

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,000
algorithms at a small scale so what's

65
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,800
the takeaway the takeaway is this

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,959
quantum mechanics was developed in the

67
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,599
early 1900s and it laid the foundation

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,400
for this development um and this

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,239
development is our present National

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Security Economic Security information

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,319
security Quantum 2.0 now is actually

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,000
using quantum mechanics as the switch

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,040
and and that's the difference and um

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,920
that holds the promise to similarly

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,760
impact this Century although it may take

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,760
um some time the third thing is you know

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,440
related to that advancing from Discovery

78
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,319
to useful machines takes engineering it

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,840
takes time this isn't going to happen

80
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,040
overnight just like developing these

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,959
fantastic chips we're using today that

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,519
didn't happen overnight either um and

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,159
maybe a fourth point which I didn't put

84
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,000
here is you got to be in the game to

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,640
play the companies that are making these

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,040
chips today didn't just jump in 2010

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,879
once somebody else figured out how to

88
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,599
make a GPU they were in it for decades

89
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
and for Quantum Computing which is also

90
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,040
Hardware hard tech it's the same

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,519
story so just a quick differentiator

92
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,360
what's a quantum computer versus a

93
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,080
classical computer well let's start with

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,560
classical computers they're based on

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,360
bits for example a transistor has a

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,239
voltage or it doesn't have a voltage

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,920
these are discrete States zero and one

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,480
and transistors are almost perfect um if

99
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,720
you set it in state one you'll measure

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,959
it in State One set it in state zero

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,519
you'll measure it in state zero and

102
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,760
that's it that's the entire world to a

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,000
transistor but a quantum computer is

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,400
based on a Quantum bit or a coherent

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,799
Quantum coherent two-state system and we

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,440
think of it as the planet Earth and if

107
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,880
you're at the North Pole you're in a

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,320
state zero which is classical and if

109
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,800
you're at the South Pole you're in a

110
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,199
state one which is classical so if

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
you're if you're a transistor you live

112
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,520
at the North and South Pole and that's

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,240
it but if you're a cubit just like

114
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,039
people you can be anywhere on the

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,800
surface of the planet Earth and when

116
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,039
you're anywhere other than the North or

117
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,000
South Pole you're in a Quantum

118
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,160
superposition of zero and one North and

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,919
South Pole simultaneously now that

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,080
sounds weird it is um but that is

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,479
quantum mechanics and that's what

122
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,440
quantum mechanics tells us and one

123
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,280
consequence of this is that measurement

124
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,240
becomes probabilistic because we can

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,000
only realize classical States so if you

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,919
happen to go to the equator and and then

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,960
you're measured as a cubit you will

128
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,479
instantly snap to the North Pole or

129
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,680
instantly snap to the South Pole and

130
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,800
which one you go to it's random it's one

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,440
of the purest forms of Randomness that

132
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,800
we know of um in our physical world go

133
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,639
to that same point on the equator again

134
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
just like flipping a coin 50/50 you'll

135
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,680
end up at the North Pole or the South

136
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,400
Pole so that's strange um it also has

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,800
consequences for how we build quantum

138
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,479
computers um they rely on encoding

139
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,160
information in a fundamentally different

140
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:32,000
way now one consequence of this is is

141
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,680
related to why quantum computers are

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,479
powerful and in a nutshell if you let's

143
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,280
go back to classical computers if you

144
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,240
have end transistors or n Bits you

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,000
actually can form an exponentially large

146
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,400
number of states two to the nth power

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,120
but you can only represent one of them

148
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,319
at a time that's the point and so if

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,840
let's say you have three transistors you

150
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,199
have everything from 000000 or 001 all

151
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,720
the way up to all of them being one

152
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,479
there are eight of those and if you for

153
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,840
some reason wanted to process all eight

154
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,639
of of those as inputs you basically have

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,400
two choices you can either buy one

156
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:12,080
computer and feed in those inputs one at

157
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,599
a time 000000 get an output 001 get an

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,919
output Etc or you can buy a really large

159
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,120
number of computers and do it in

160
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,240
parallel but either way if you have an

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,639
exponentially large number of inputs you

162
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,440
neither need exponential time or

163
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,759
exponential Hardware to do that

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,400
task now a quantum computer again let's

165
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,000
have n qits n Quantum bits there are two

166
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,080
to the N classical components but we can

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
put them all into a single state that's

168
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,680
the difference and so you end up with a

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,199
single Quantum State um which represents

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,240
all of these classical States

171
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,599
simultaneously and this leads to a

172
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,560
Quantum version of parallelism and

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,280
importantly Quantum interference which

174
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm not going to talk about today but

175
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,680
that is what underlies the power of a

176
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,160
quantum computer so how do we take

177
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,120
advantage of this Hardware

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,639
and the answer is with algorithms and I

179
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
show here at the bottom many of my

180
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,560
colleagues here at MIT who are doing

181
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,479
various aspects of the work on Quantum

182
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,360
algorithms and I won't read the whole

183
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,199
chart but let me just say the algorithm

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,919
is in this column um the classical time

185
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
is in this column and you can see that

186
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,000
the size of the system n tends to be

187
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,759
upstairs in the exponent whereas if you

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,039
look at the time on a quantum computer

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,199
that n comes downstairs that is an

190
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:32,080
exponential Improvement and some of the

191
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,240
um algorithm or use cases are of course

192
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,720
simulation of uh chemistries reaction

193
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,400
rates materials Etc um Crypt analysis

194
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,080
sampling solutions to large uh linear

195
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,000
systems of equations that pervades

196
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,520
engineering optimization and

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,240
search so what do we need to achieve

198
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,840
commercial Quantum Advantage well first

199
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,280
off there better be no fast known

200
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,240
classical algorithm if there is use one

201
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,680
of those fantastic G pus or tpus or CPUs

202
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,919
because they're awesome they really work

203
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,840
well but let's assume we don't have that

204
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,039
the second thing we need to do is have a

205
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,479
known fast Quantum algorithm there are

206
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,560
lots of problems where we don't know how

207
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,840
to do it on a classical computer and we

208
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,440
don't know how to do it on a quantum

209
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,360
computer so you need of course a fast

210
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,240
Quantum

211
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
algorithm and the third thing for

212
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,680
commercial success is it better be a

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
useful problem we have a number of

214
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,680
examples of quantum algorithms which

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,199
demonstrate exponential Advantage but we

216
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,080
don't know how to commercialize it okay

217
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,320
so if we look at this overlap today it's

218
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,279
a rather small region and I you know

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,479
every talk I give I encourage people to

220
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,519
go out and develop new Quantum

221
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,039
algorithms for specific use cases this

222
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,560
is very

223
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,680
important and with this there are two

224
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,560
types of quantum advantage and what that

225
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,640
means is that the size of the computer

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,760
you need how much time it takes to get a

227
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
solution how much energy you'll use um

228
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,720
however you want to think about it it's

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,880
proportional to two factors one is a

230
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,560
polom in the size of the system n and

231
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,640
the other is

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,320
exponential so one Improvement that

233
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
quantum computers can do is they can

234
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,480
improve the preactor that's a polinomial

235
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,320
Improvement for example Grover search

236
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,120
algorithm something that goes as n

237
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,040
becomes square root of n we would say a

238
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,360
quadratic speed up that's good we'll

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,720
take it but that pales in comparison to

240
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,160
the exponential speed up here we reduce

241
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,040
um exponential to polinomial meaning n

242
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,120
appeared upstairs but now it appears

243
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,200
downstairs and and this is exponential

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,920
and we generally don't um see that in

245
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,920
our daily lives um and let me just give

246
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,120
an example of how fast exponential

247
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,480
growth can be let's imagine you wanted

248
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,680
to simulate a quantum computer on a

249
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,399
classical computer and then you ask how

250
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,519
much classical memory do I need to keep

251
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,839
track of all of those two to the end

252
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,399
coefficients okay so if you have 30

253
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,200
cubits that's 2 to the 30th power you'll

254
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,880
you can do that on a

255
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,320
laptop go to Just 50 cubits and now you

256
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,120
need a top 500 supercomputer in all of

257
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,200
its

258
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,680
memory go to 80 cubits and now somehow

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,600
we need to link together all of the

260
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,720
computers in the world and use all of

261
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,519
their memory okay and and now it's a

262
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,000
clearly in fantasy land go to 160 cubits

263
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,519
and now we need to use all of the

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,519
Silicon atoms on Earth and each silicon

265
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,959
atom is a memory element and finally

266
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,720
just 10 times higher than where we

267
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,240
started 300 cubits and now we would need

268
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,440
to employ all of the atoms in the known

269
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,760
universe each each one of those atoms

270
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,839
being a memory element okay that's

271
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,399
exponential

272
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,720
growth the challenge of course is to

273
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,040
harness it and use it so there are two

274
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,800
time scales that are related to Quantum

275
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,480
Computing and one of them is the

276
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,360
coherence time so if you have a quantum

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,880
computer in a known State and you start

278
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,160
a computation from that point forward

279
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,839
immediately it starts reacting with its

280
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,639
environment of course I'm trying to run

281
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,240
an algorithm but in parallel with that

282
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,240
the environment is conspiring against me

283
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,920
and what that means is that over time

284
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,800
you can think of that Quantum State

285
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,720
blurring and eventually being lost now

286
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,079
the cubits are still there they didn't

287
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,920
disappear but the state that they're in

288
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,880
is unknown to me I tried to get to An

289
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,200
Answer over here but the environment

290
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,000
took my quantum computer somewhere else

291
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,639
the time scale over which that happens

292
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,800
is called the coherence

293
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,000
time the second time we care about is

294
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,800
the gate time how fast can I Implement

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,160
my algorithm that's like the clock speed

296
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,399
of your classical computer

297
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,279
and the figure of Merit is how many

298
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,680
gates per coherence time can I Implement

299
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,600
okay with that what we can do is compare

300
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,680
different Technologies against one

301
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,720
another and so this figure of Merit is

302
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,560
on this axis how many gates before an

303
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,360
error on average and that's one to one

304
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,240
in what we would call the gate Fidelity

305
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,920
so one air in 100 that's 99% good or 99%

306
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,279
Fidelity One air in a th

307
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,600
99.9 Etc the horizontal axis is the gat

308
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,440
speed in hertz you can think of that

309
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,480
like your clock speed in your

310
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,040
conventional computer and of course you

311
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,360
want to be in the upper right corner for

312
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,320
best performance and to run a Quantum

313
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,560
algorithm there are two types of gates

314
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,839
that you need that's it one is a single

315
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,399
Cubit gate you apply a gate to one cubit

316
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,199
or a two Cubit gate where you apply an

317
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,639
operation to two cubits together and

318
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,160
with that you can do any arbitrary

319
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,079
Quantum logic and so now you can see

320
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,560
where these different Technologies fall

321
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,279
for example trapped ions and I show some

322
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,240
folks here at it working on trapped ions

323
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,519
um are one of the leaders

324
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,920
today superc conducting cubits is an

325
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
area that I work in along with my

326
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,199
colleagues here at MIT and you can see

327
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,519
in some sense they're both equidistant

328
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,160
from this upper right corner which is

329
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,959
part of the reason why we don't have a

330
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,639
clear winter

331
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,920
today neutral atoms have also Advanced

332
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,399
tremendously in the last few years um

333
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,399
here are some folks working on neutal

334
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,959
atoms and then also Envy centers uh

335
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,240
we'll hear from Dirk in just a moment um

336
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,000
and and my own group is also starting

337
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,079
some work on silic and Quantum dots so

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,519
there are many candidate Technologies to

339
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,880
realize a quantum computer and which one

340
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,680
will be the winner I don't think we know

341
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,519
and if we look at the last century of

342
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,360
classical electronic Computing there

343
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,519
won't be a winner the technology will

344
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,839
evolve from one technology to the next

345
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,680
to the next okay this is what quantum

346
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,560
computers look like today um here's IB

347
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
IBM's Osprey 433 cubits you can see it's

348
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,839
3D integrated this technology was

349
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,320
invented and patented here at uh MIT

350
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,399
here is uh the Sycamore chip from Google

351
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,760
the first uh demonstration of quantum

352
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,600
Advantage this is a neutral atom quantum

353
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,120
computer you can see an optical table in

354
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,680
here uh this looks like a big black box

355
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,600
which it is but inside there would be a

356
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,959
trapped ion quantum computer and this is

357
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,279
a Quantum analer from d-wave now this of

358
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,639
course you'll recognize that's not a

359
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,839
quantum computer that's the uh right

360
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,519
flyer it was the first um well let me

361
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,720
say this it wasn't the first time that

362
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,279
humankind flew we had hot air balloons

363
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
we had gliders but this was the first

364
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,240
time where it all came together that a

365
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,959
person's on there steering it it's

366
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,399
self-propelled it got off the ground it

367
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,600
maybe went 100 feet six feet off the

368
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,000
ground that's about it I put this

369
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,639
picture on here because when we saw this

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,199
demonstration or at least in hindsight

371
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,759
when we see this demonstration we know

372
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,079
that we knew that that commercial

373
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,160
Aviation would come it might be 20 years

374
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,360
away or 30 years away but this brought

375
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,519
it all together and we know okay this is

376
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,279
going to happen and I think that the

377
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,240
demonstrations that we've seen here from

378
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,639
these quantum computers are at this

379
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
stage it's still very early stage but we

380
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,920
do believe that commercial Quantum

381
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,880
computation will come so to realize this

382
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,279
though we need to engineer systems that

383
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:53,320
are robust reproducible and

384
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,399
extensible so last slide I believe um

385
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,279
one of the grand challenges today is to

386
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,600
do active Quantum error correction so

387
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,839
what is that

388
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,880
well we just saw that the error rates of

389
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,639
our physical cubits are 1 in a th000

390
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,240
maybe 1 in 10,000 that's not enough for

391
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,360
commercial applications at scale for

392
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,079
that we need to be able to run a billion

393
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
or even a trillion operations so the

394
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,920
error rates have to be much much better

395
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,560
how do we get there there's a huge gap

396
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,600
um well the way that we get there oh by

397
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,079
the way transistors are almost perfect

398
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,639
uh thankfully we don't have to get this

399
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,360
good but there's a reason that

400
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,240
transistors have done so well because

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
their error rate is almost one part 10

402
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,759
the

403
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,399
20 so the way that we're going to go

404
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,639
from the yellow physical cubits to

405
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,560
practical applications is basically to

406
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,759
form teams of cubits we call those um

407
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,680
logical cubits Quantum Eric correction

408
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,519
so rather than one cubit we'll encode

409
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,519
the information shown here in nine

410
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
yellow cubits and then we have some blue

411
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,600
ones nearby which you can think of as

412
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,079
referees that are just checking where an

413
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,079
error occurred uh what type of error it

414
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,199
is and it tells us so that we can go and

415
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,480
fix it and this is just like forming a

416
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,800
team of people

417
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,000
and the concept is quite similar if you

418
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,079
think of say a kindergarten classroom uh

419
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,480
with say 20 kids in it that's obviously

420
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,880
total chaos and if you add more kids to

421
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,160
that the chaos only increases right so

422
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,120
fortunately along our education at some

423
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,079
point we reach a threshold where

424
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,839
individually we are good enough that we

425
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,959
can work with another person and

426
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,160
together we outperform each individual

427
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,440
and that's the concept for logical uh

428
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,720
cubits is that the cubits if they're

429
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
individually good enough putting many of

430
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,319
them together actually makes the

431
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,360
situation better that's where you want

432
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:38,639
to be and of course there's a cost that

433
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,440
goes along with that you have to have an

434
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,800
HR department now to take care of all

435
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,880
those people but there's an exponential

436
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,880
Improvement in the size of the team

437
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,040
which we call the distance so if you go

438
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,839
from three on a side distance three to

439
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,600
five on a side distance five you get an

440
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,800
exponential Improvement in your error

441
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,880
rate and it's a very powerful

442
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,199
Improvement what I'm showing here on

443
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,560
this axis is the physical Cubit rate

444
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,760
that's the individual and on this is The

445
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,439
Logical error rate that's the team and

446
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,880
you can see this is this is log scale so

447
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,360
even each time I improve my team members

448
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,799
by a factor two Factor two Factor two

449
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,079
you can see that the error rate is

450
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,319
dropping exponentially for different

451
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,919
size uh teams distance three distance 5

452
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,360
Etc all the way up to distance 25 and

453
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,039
already we're at 10 Theus 6 here so

454
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,039
getting down here it will happen okay I

455
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,600
just want to mention quickly that Google

456
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,520
very recently put a paper out this

457
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,240
summer um where they actually

458
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,840
demonstrated and we'll try to explain

459
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,360
this whole chart but let me just say

460
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,880
that they've demonstrated a logical

461
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Cubit that outperformed any of the

462
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,039
individual physical cubits on the team

463
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,640
the team outperformed any individual and

464
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,520
that was a real milestone for the field

465
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,919
um that they went from distance 3 to

466
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,679
seven there have been several other

467
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,039
demonstrations with other Technologies

468
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,880
but this was the first one that showed

469
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:04,480
Beyond threshold old um demonstrations

470
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,440
so truly last slide so today's reality

471
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,880
with quantum computers um first off

472
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,480
they're not going to replace classical

473
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,200
computers for two reasons one we need a

474
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,440
classical computer to do the error

475
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,360
correction and second quantum computers

476
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,840
don't solve all problems and so there's

477
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,200
still going to be an important need for

478
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,840
classical computers going forward I

479
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,440
already said this um but I'll say it

480
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
again we need more Quantum algorithms

481
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,919
and we need to apply them to specific

482
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,720
use cases of interest to Industry

483
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,320
um didn't talk too much about encryption

484
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,799
or um Crypt analysis but Shores

485
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,760
algorithm does compromise the RSA crypto

486
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,240
system um we don't have a quantum

487
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,080
computer large enough to do that today

488
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,480
and it will likely be 10 or 20 years

489
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,360
before we do but nonetheless we need to

490
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,840
switch over to new crypto systems they

491
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,120
call them postquantum crypto systems and

492
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,280
we need to do that right now because

493
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,480
there's information that we are

494
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,559
encrypting now that's being stored on

495
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,480
hard drive somewhere that will become

496
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:02,400
susceptible to attack in the future and

497
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,559
we want to retain security over that um

498
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,320
and then likely we'll need Quantum error

499
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,440
correction to go forward and so um with

500
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,799
that here are some takeaways uh Quantum

501
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,120
2.0 is going to in fact impact our

502
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,000
future information and economic security

503
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,080
uh we do need a Quantum aware Workforce

504
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,799
and uh we're working hard here at MIT to

505
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,600
do that we do have some professional

506
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,440
development courses if you're if you're

507
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,400
interested in that um and and the last

508
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,120
one is that we need to judiciously

509
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,559
protect our nation's IP you know there's

510
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,159
been some recent developments in export

511
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,840
control regulations around Quantum

512
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,840
Computing that's very important because

513
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,720
we need to protect this but at the same

514
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,240
time we don't want to break the

515
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,679
Fantastic Innovation engine that we have

516
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,640
at our us universities so we got to get

517
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,600
that right I don't have the answers

518
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,320
necessarily but but we should keep that

519
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,559
as a topic of discussion so so that we

520
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,280
can both Advanced Quantum Computing uh

521
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,159
and also uh do it quickly um and here's

522
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,000
my email address be happy to to uh

523
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,540
correspond and thank you for your

524
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,960
attention

525
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,960
[Applause]
