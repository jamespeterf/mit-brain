00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,279
from the same stuff that you're

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,559
suffering from they've been affected by

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,759
Wars they lost their homes they lost

everything that is happening or

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,310
currently happening in Sudan this is the

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,800
part that is sentimental to this

someone who has leveraged mit's open

26
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,280
learning resources during a really

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,080
difficult time for herself her family

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,080
and her country that's right Michael

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,799
today's guest is Saud khed Ahmed alumar

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,119
an open learner from Kum Sudan she

31
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,080
earned her bachelor's degree in

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,119
electrical and electronic engineering

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,799
from the University of katum in 2022 one

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,159
year later in May of 2023 sadly sujud

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,720
was forced to flee Sudan because of the

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,880
ongoing war in her home country the

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
company she was working for shut down

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,360
and she was forced to leave her home and

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,320
some of her family members behind she

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,520
currently lives in Egypt where she's

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,159
working on her certificate in computer

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,560
and data science as part of mit's

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,640
Imaging Talent program and she's working

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,280
towards a micro Masters in statistics

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,920
there are so many difficult and

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,000
inspiring parts of saud's story but one

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,759
thing that stuck out to me is that sujud

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,320
applied to emerging talent because she

49
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,479
felt like she had nothing left to

50
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,200
lose now a year into the program she

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,840
sees the skills that she's learned

52
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,039
through MIT open learning as essential

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,160
tools that will help her rebuild her

54
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,160
home country sujud is deeply committed

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,760
to building a prosperous future for

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Sudan and placing her home country at

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,319
the Forefront of technological

58
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,239
advancement her long-term goal is to

59
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,120
establish a research center in Sudan

60
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,680
which will use data science to address

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,400
local social economical and

62
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,000
environmental challenges by in the short

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,480
time she's already putting her data

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,720
science and program

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,080
programming skills to good use she runs

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,720
a database called NASA Al Sudan which

67
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,120
curates a list of scholarships available

68
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,959
to stanes students yes ajude is a really

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,360
inspiring person and I admire her deep

70
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,760
commitment to her country and her own

71
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,840
learning I'm really excited for our

72
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,400
listeners to hear our entire

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,280
conversation with suude we talk about

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,560
her hopes for Sudan along with how ocw

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
helped her make lifelong friends and how

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,599
she keeps herself motivated during the

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,040
dark times this is a really really great

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,680
episode Michael and the perfect story to

79
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,599
end our first season with so without

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,900
further Ado he's our conversation with

81
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:22,589

[Music]

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,280
in

84
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,200
Sudan my name

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,720
is um I'm 25 years old almost 26 I was

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,480
missed by saying 25 but I'm almost 26 um

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,720
I come from a country in Africa called

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,720
Sudan and I graduated from University of

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,760
Harum electrical and electronics

90
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,560
engineering department and I specialized

91
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,079
in control and instrumentation I've sort

92
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,200
of drifted into data science and data

93
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,879
and data related stuff and yeah I'm just

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,360
exploring it and learning about it would

95
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,360
you want to just uh start off with sort

96
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,239
of how you grew up and your experience

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
with education then I grew up in the

98
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,560
capital city of

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,040
Sudan basically Kum consists of three

100
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:27,000
cities umman and bah I grew up in umman

101
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,800
uh it's a lovely city and my childhood

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,199
was was lovely I guess I grew up with

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,840
four siblings they're all males also I

104
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,520
shared a hoppy With My Father which is

105
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,120
reading and I think it participated a

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,320
lot into the person I am today and the

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,639
personality I have we just like read

108
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,560
books and discussed them as of my

109
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,320
education in my basic school I went to a

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,800
private school and then after that my

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,479
experience like changed a lot because I

112
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,160
moved from a private school into a

113
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,039
public high school which had too many

114
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,320
number of students there they all come

115
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,000
from different backgrounds they all have

116
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,280
different stories and different

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
personalities I think it was around that

118
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,880
time I started to realize that I'm

119
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,759
interested in mathematics that and I

120
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,919
love it I love mathematics so I started

121
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,560
to explore it I did not have like much

122
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,919
room to explore it I didn't know what

123
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,919
where to look or I didn't have anyone in

124
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,479
my circle who was also interested in

125
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,600
math and I think it was around that time

126
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,199
where I realized that I need to find

127
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,919
other sources or I need to find one

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,440
place to pursue this uh interest so I

129
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,440
applied for University of Kum one of the

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,960
prestigious universities in Sudan and I

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,680
applied for the electrical and

132
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,400
electronics engineering department I got

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,720
in and I was really excited because all

134
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,880
the things I heard about it was that

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,160
engineering was embedded with these

136
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,759
mathematic courses and that we get we'd

137
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,000
get the chance to explore so many of the

138
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,160
stuff in math but then then I think I

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,440
was shocked because the content was not

140
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,639
did not have like in-depth things about

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,080
math or like too many Advanced topics

142
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,400
about mathematics and I think it it was

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,680
that there that I realized that it's not

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,840
the answer maybe it's like the start of

145
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,720
the answer but it's not it and I need to

146
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,680
like seek my uh pursue my interest

147
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,360
somewhere else I love your journey

148
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,800
particularly because I understand and

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
resonate with the fact you know when you

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,440
come from a small

151
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,520
a private school then you go to a big

152
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,360
school and it's like oh look at all

153
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,120
these people and it's a new experience

154
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,520
and we I can also understand actually I

155
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,720
can understand this as well I also

156
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,120
wanted to take an engineering background

157
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,639
I ended up taking a science uh so a

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,160
computer science course as well but

159
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,639
that's an interesting journey I just

160
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,759
wanted you to shed some light on the

161
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,360
difference between online learning when

162
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,879
you first when you finally encountered

163
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,960
it and traditional learning back home

164
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,560
how was that for you so I think the

165
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,759
difference between traditional uh

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,160
learning or maybe the learning at school

167
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,039
and then we had like structured content

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,840
that was not always up to dat with what

169
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,440
was happening in the world especially in

170
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,400
specializations like engineering and uh

171
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,319
that are like they're changing at the

172
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,160
moment and they're evolving in too many

173
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,720
Technologies are being Advanced every

174
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,000
day and that was not reflected in the

175
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,960
content that we had at the time but then

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,160
on the other hand the online learning

177
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,720
and the online material it's embedded

178
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,520
with uh knowledge it's unlimited let me

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,319
talk about YouTube you go to one link

180
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,000
and then you start learning and then you

181
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,000
find another one that takes you to

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,680
another thing or another topic and it's

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,039
just like it opens a world full of

184
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,720
possibilities and you can get to explore

185
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,520
everything you want so just a follow-up

186
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,360
question there so when you first found

187
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,039
MIT open course where was that through

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,400
YouTube and was that during your

189
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,159
undergraduate studies or was that during

190
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,479
uh the time when you started becoming a

191
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:14,080
teacher assistant my first experience

192
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:16,479
with MIT open course s was during my

193
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,039
undergrads actually it was through one

194
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,639
of my Tas uh around the second year of

195
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,120
my undergrads we were struggling with

196
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,120
programming classes at that time it was

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,560
like our first impression with it and we

198
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,839
did not just fully understand it and we

199
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,279
wanted something more to understand it

200
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,599
and one of the T suggested that we look

201
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,399
at one of the courses at MIT I think it

202
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,959
was in YouTube the course was in YouTube

203
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,240
it was recorded it was not just me I had

204
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,560
like couple of other fellow students

205
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,880
with me and we studied the course

206
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,600
together and then after that we wanted

207
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,160
to like okay there's this website it has

208
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,480
so many courses not just about

209
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,959
programming about too many other stuff

210
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,120
some of which we had we already had in

211
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:05,000
our undergrad or in our materials and

212
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,120
it's just delivered differently

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,160
structured in a different way and yes I

214
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,160
owe MIT open course where a lot of my

215
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,320
mathematical knowledge and mathematical

216
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,200
understanding it comes from there I

217
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,440
guess amazing amazing it's really cool

218
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,560
that you were in a group too you know I

219
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,839
think you might be the first learner

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,079
that was using MIT open course where in

221
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,800
a group would would you just maybe talk

222
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,560
about how using open courseware

223
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,680
especially in the group it sounded like

224
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,240
it helped you academically but did it

225
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,360
help you like with personal

226
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,640
relationships with friendships I did not

227
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,160
actually reflect on this throughout my

228
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,519
life but now looking at it I think it

229
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,920
did help me and uh especially when we

230
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,240
were we were just like we were in the

231
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,959
our second year of my undergrads and

232
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,560
around that time the structure of

233
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,720
University um like I applied for

234
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,399
electrical and electronics engineering

235
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,440
specialization but at first two years we

236
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,200
study like from different

237
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,120
specializations so we were too many

238
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,040
students coming from different areas and

239
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,800
going into different areas and I didn't

240
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,240
like have the chance to meet for with

241
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,720
with students from my patch or who we

242
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,640
going to like spend the rest of my

243
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,600
undergrads with and then when this came

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,360
up and when we started like to form the

245
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,959
groups and other students from my patch

246
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,399
came in who are now are some of my best

247
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,360
friends in my life even after like 10

248
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,480
years of graduating uh we spent too many

249
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,000
time together we would like uh sit we

250
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,160
maybe we would not just like attend the

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,800
lectures or go through the content

252
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,279
together but we would come and discuss

253
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,079
it and uh share maybe some some people

254
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,680
go through different course and then we

255
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,440
would share it we would share the

256
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,079
knowledge we had and in between this

257
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,760
time of learning we would like just

258
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:07,279
chitchat and exchange just like the

259
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,160
basic human interaction and boom we

260
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,279
became friends did you ever use ocw for

261
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,000
other things outside career because they

262
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,560
have so many topics on there that are

263
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,440
outside so was it strictly for book

264
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,279
purposes are you still using ocw right

265
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,480
now in your life I think originally it

266
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,160
was for the pure academic reasons that I

267
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,600
started like going through and studying

268
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,440
it it was just for pure mathematic

269
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,399
content and other stuff related to my

270
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,000
academic Journey but definitely in

271
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,600
between then and there I did go through

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,320
some of the courses that are not just

273
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,560
related to my academic Life currently

274
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,959
I'm using it to go through my uh MIT

275
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,839
emerging learning uh program it's also

276
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:00,000
academic but uh it's helping me a lot

277
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,720
which brings me to this other thing

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
that listening to these videos and

279
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,240
attending these lectures had has helped

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,360
me a lot with my English language and it

281
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,279
was a challenge at first because as I

282
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,680
said during my uh high school and before

283
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,240
my undergrads I did not attend a school

284
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,320
or university which was in full English

285
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,560
and then when I joined my undergrads

286
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,240
when I joined University it was like

287
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,040
just pure English which was an extreme

288
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,040
challenge but listening to these courses

289
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,279
and going through them has helped me a

290
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,880
lot in listening and understanding in

291
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,480
the academic English and how to

292
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,360
communicate with this language so this

293
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,440
is one of the major parts that helped me

294
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,440
with throughout my

295
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,760
[Music]

296
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,240
life uh how did you find Imaging Talent

297
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,680
first of all uh maybe you could give us

298
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,360
a b brief background about that I was

299
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,399
going through through really hard time

300
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,560
in my life when I found out about the

301
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,920
MIT emerging Talent program um if you

302
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,320
don't know I come from Sudan and Sudan

303
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,079
is currently suffering from uh a

304
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,880
conflict which is it's it's a war it's

305
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,199
not just a conflict it's a war that's

306
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:23,519
happening in Sudan and in May of 2023 I

307
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:26,440
was forced to flee Sudan and uh relocate

308
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,920
to Egypt I lost like everything that I

309
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,920
love I lost my home um some of my family

310
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,959
were still stuck there and even at the

311
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,160
moment I still have parts of my family

312
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,000
still stuck there I have friends stuck

313
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,120
there and we we all lost loved ones and

314
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,800
I just couldn't find the purpose of my

315
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,600
life or why am I doing anything or

316
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,199
what's what's the reason I remember I

317
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,320
met this one friend and she was talking

318
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,279
to me and we were discussing just how

319
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,680
this words affecting our lives and how

320
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:59,519
we need to how we need to overcome it

321
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,639
not just overcoming but we need to work

322
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,199
on on ourselves so when the time comes

323
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,079
for us to go back to Sudan and build it

324
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,199
we have the knowledge and we have the

325
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,360
power to do so at that time I was

326
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,079
looking for materials and stuff and this

327
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,000
same friend she sent me the application

328
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,320
for MIT merging Talent is coming in like

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,320
couple of hours and it was talking about

330
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,639
the program and that Sudanese people are

331
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,279
now eligible for it because it's

332
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,360
directed toward people who are suffering

333
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,320
from Wars conflicts and who are refugees

334
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,480
and everything the deadline was

335
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,279
approaching like couple of hours and I

336
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,600
needed to prepare for it and write all

337
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,440
the essays and it has like a

338
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,000
mathematical tests and other programming

339
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,279
tests and everything and then when I

340
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,880
reached like the last part it needed a

341
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,160
video recording this is really funny

342
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,120
because every time I remember it I just

343
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I laugh about it um it had like a video

344
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,959
recording thing and at that time I was

345
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,600
in Egypt and it was summer and they had

346
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:02,240
like this power outage that comes in

347
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,880
Egypt for a couple of hours and I needed

348
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,680
to record the video for this and I

349
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,720
didn't know when will the electricity

350
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,800
come back so I said okay I don't have

351
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,839
anything to lose let's just try so

352
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,920
instead of recording a video I sent a

353
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,079
voice recording I didn't think they

354
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,519
would accept it because why would MIT

355
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,399
accept a voice memo when when they

356
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,839
clearly stated that they wanted like a

357
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,720
video recording but I sent it anyway I

358
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,720
had nothing to lose and I didn't have

359
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,800
Alternatives so I sent it and couple of

360
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,680
weeks after that I got the email I got

361
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,880
the acceptance email and I think the

362
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,600
program has been really helpful for me

363
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,279
coming across people that are suffering

364
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,160
from the same stuff that you're

365
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,360
suffering from or have been going

366
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,560
through the same Journey the same things

367
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,880
or not just maybe not just the same but

368
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,800
something similar and they they've been

369
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,480
affected by Wars they they lost their

370
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,360
homes they lost loved ones like going

371
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,360
live with people who understand the

372
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,639
things that you are are going through it

373
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,800
it sort of helped in my healing process

374
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,079
or in my like understanding process of

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,079
absorbing everything that is happening

376
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,319
or currently happening in Sudan this is

377
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:22,399
the part that is sentimental to this

378
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:25,040
journey what project are you working on

379
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,639
that side uh how is it important to you

380
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
how did you arrive to that kind of

381
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,639
project maybe if you can shed some light

382
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,839
in that aspect as well the project that

383
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,240
we're currently doing so our graduation

384
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,600
project from the program uh we United me

385
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,240
and another fellows from another MIT

386
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,000
fellows from Sudan uh and we're doing

387
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,319
this project which is directed toward

388
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,920
education in Sudan the educational

389
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:52,920
system basically just fell down the

390
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,880
schools are not working universities are

391
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,839
not working some of them are working

392
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,160
online but the majority of the schools

393
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,360
and universities in Sudan has not been

394
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,520
working for more than a year now which

395
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,120
is a disaster and we need to look at it

396
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,679
and we need to like find solutions to it

397
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,160
so our graduation project that we're

398
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,880
trying to offer students with

399
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,120
alternatives to this there is this uh

400
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,799
there's this website called NASA Sudan

401
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,079
it's an initiative that collects all the

402
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,240
other Alternatives or all the other like

403
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,520
scholarships universities that accept

404
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,559
Sudanese people outside of Sudan and the

405
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,240
requirements and all the process that

406
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,480
they need to go through in order to

407
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,160
apply for these universities so we're

408
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,039
helping with their databases we're

409
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,120
rebuilding the databases for this

410
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,520
universities and the website and

411
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,440
everything in between that I was just

412
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,400
curious if you wanted to talk about you

413
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,280
know after the

414
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,520
program after all the learning on open

415
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,679
course where if you have a vision for

416
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,960
your own future or if you have an idea

417
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:04,919
of where you want to go in in the future

418
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:08,000
at this point in time well I'm still not

419
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:11,360
quite sure I don't have like a clearer

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,280
vision of where I want to go I think

421
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,960
merely because the situation in Sudan is

422
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,840
not quite clear yet and all my career

423
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,200
plans and my life plans are oriented

424
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,240
around Sudan and I think this past year

425
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,400
has affirmed me that I really want to

426
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,840
give back to Sudan and I want to help

427
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,679
build San because I can't I can't belong

428
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,360
anywhere I can't find anywhere to belong

429
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,159
and I want to build Sudan for the other

430
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,039
people the other Generations that will

431
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:44,760
come to find some place to belong to

432
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:46,039
because belonging is one of the it's one

433
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,000
of the most

434
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,640
important uh feelings for for human

435
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,159
beings and I sort of want to contribute

436
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,720
this knowledge I have or I think I have

437
00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:00,320
to building Sudan and

438
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,120
to to its healing and it's its recovery

439
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,000
so currently I'm just looking for

440
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,679
opportunities uh throughout the program

441
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
and after after finishing the program

442
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,480
I'm looking for opportunities to

443
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,559
contribute this that's perfect no we we

444
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,000
understand that having certainty in the

445
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,960
future um you know one final question

446
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,760
from me and then I'll let Emanuel kind

447
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,960
of take over is do you have any advice

448
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,880
for anyone that may be in the same exact

449
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,480
situation that you are if I can give

450
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,120
like advice for people coming from not

451
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,200
just the same background but from

452
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,640
communities where they do not have

453
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,400
access to maybe quality education or uh

454
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,480
opportunities don't wait for them just

455
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,600
seek these opportunities and do

456
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,320
not I remember I read this somewhere

457
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,799
that it was something about

458
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,720
self-rejection and how we always like

459
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,919
self reject ourselves and we do not give

460
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,320
ourselves the opportunity to even even

461
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,400
be considered for something and just do

462
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,039
not self- reject yourselves you're not

463
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,440
losing anything by trying but when

464
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,919
you're not trying you're not even

465
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,600
presenting yourself and you're not

466
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,960
giving yourself the opportunity to being

467
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,919
considered for something or to take

468
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,880
something so self-rejection is the worst

469
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,520
enemy for everyone so just don't self-

470
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,120
reject yourself if there is opportunity

471
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,120
and you're not going to to lose anything

472
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,800
so why not just try it and why not just

473
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,400
like take this

474
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,840
[Music]

475
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,720
opportunity if they gave you a magic one

476
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,039
and they told you okay you could add

477
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,880
something to the

478
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,480
ocw movement like you could add

479
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,640
something to this or remove something

480
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,159
from it what would that be if I have a

481
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,559
magical power and I am to add anything

482
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,039
to MIT open course whereare what would

483
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,440
it be I think the one thing that I would

484
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:04,600
add and uh to find some medical way or

485
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,159
some medical power just to to get rid of

486
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,279
the language barrier and maybe give

487
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,880
everyone the opportunity to benefit from

488
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,960
from the material and from all the stuff

489
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,400
that are out there without the language

490
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,320
barrier that's awesome that's great s

491
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,159
Jude I love your story and I would like

492
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,159
to personally thank you for you know

493
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,760
telling us your story and we hope

494
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,600
that anyone else listening to this will

495
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,320
get inspired you know will know that

496
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,799
actually this is not just some online

497
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,919
learning thing online it's actually

498
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,320
helping lives it's helping people not

499
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,120
just in school outside school in the

500
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,480
toughest situations I guess my final

501
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,000
question to you would be first of

502
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,960
all as someone who has gone through all

503
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,760
this I know it can't be easy maybe how

504
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,520
do you

505
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,640
stay focused how do you stay strong you

506
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,200
say you mentioned don't self reject

507
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,039
which is a powerful thing like what do

508
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,240
you do to self motivate to self you know

509
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,799
push to drive when in that moment when

510
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,120
you feel like giving up what moves you

511
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,440
well about staying focused I won't lie

512
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,919
I'm not focused most of the times

513
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,520
because like as you said the world is

514
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,840
still happening and people are still

515
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,240
suffering so most of the times that the

516
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,120
all the news coming from Sudan just

517
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,360
absorbs us and we find ourselves

518
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,240
even though we're not in Sudan but we

519
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,640
are in Sudan and even so we're not

520
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,159
physically like there and we're not

521
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,360
physically hurting and we're not hearing

522
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,360
the bombings and everything but we are

523
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:50,159
there and it's hard to stay focused and

524
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:52,880
it's hard to to continue with our lives

525
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,760
even though we know that a war is

526
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
happening back there and people are

527
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,440
dying back there so most of the times

528
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,279
it's really hard most of the times it's

529
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,640
impossible to focus or to study or to do

530
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:09,880
anything productive so I could say that

531
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,919
maybe every couple of productive days I

532
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,080
just cvel in my bed and I don't do

533
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,360
anything I don't find the energy in me

534
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,679
to get out of my bed and do something

535
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,880
productive and I understand that I

536
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,520
understand the reason behind that but

537
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,080
then I try to just remind myself with

538
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,559
the whole purpose of it and why am I

539
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,400
doing it and that there will come a time

540
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,640
that we will build Sudan it will come

541
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,880
even though we don't know when whether

542
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,520
we are going to be alive to witness it

543
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,640
or to participate in it but if we are

544
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,400
Sudan will need us to be at a strong as

545
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,400
possible to build it and to participate

546
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,799
in it and this sort of gives me some

547
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,640
peace it sort of helps me a lot with

548
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,880
okay I'm not doing it just for myself

549
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,360
I'm not doing it just for my family but

550
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,960
in the bigger picture and with with a

551
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,159
heart filled with hope I'm doing it for

552
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,600
Sudan for when the time comes

553

ready well thank you sujud again I think

555
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,320
so many people around the world are

556
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
going to be inspired by how powerful

557
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,600
your story is and the knowledge you've

558
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,000
shared so we are very grateful that you

journey and you know I know it may not

561
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,080
be complete uh representation of your

562
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,039
journey but I hope it does capture a

563
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,360
small piece of it that other people can

564
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,080
find inspiration from thank you again

[Music]

569
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,640
opportunity wow sujud has really been

570
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,640
able to do something extraordinary she

571
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,440
spent the most most difficult moment in

572
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,640
her life expanding her own knowledge so

573
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,799
that she can rebuild her home country of

574
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,200
Sudan it's very

575
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,679
inspiring what's been on your mind since

576
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,919
we spoke to suude Emanuel yeah Michael

577
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,559
I've been thinking a lot about this

578
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,559
episode because it's a very touching

579
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,360
episode it's a very inspiring episode I

580
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,600
like the part where she says never self-

581
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,440
reject but here we have someone a young

582
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,480
person in their mid 20s trying to start

583
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,640
their life and the worst possible thing

584
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,279
that could have happened to someone

585
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,000
happens but in the midst of all that

586
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,880
she pushes through she perseveres and

587
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,840
what amazes me the most is somehow ocw

588
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,480
was may not have solved all our problems

589
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,559
but it kind of provided a Guiding Light

590
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,480
it kind of provided a hope in the midst

591
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,919
of all this glimmering Darkness so what

592
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,799
about you Michael how was your takea

593
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:52,880
away from this I found saud's

594
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:55,840
honesty to be the most impactful thing

595
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,760
to me she doesn't shy away from sharing

596
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,279
that there's multiple days where she

597
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,320
just can't find the energy to get out of

598
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:07,640
bed and when you think about the

599
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,360
separation from first her

600
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,520
land but also her family and her

601
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,600
language you should really just take a

602
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,360
moment and pause and reflect on how that

603
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,159
would be for you as well but despite all

604
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,799
that she continues to improve herself

605
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,600
she continues to hope for a better day I

606
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:28,760
just find that so inspiring especially

607
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,840
coming from a country like the United

608
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,440
States where we've never had to worry

609
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,360
about that type of separation from the

610
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,559
ones we love so that was the most

611
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,640
impactful thing for me and Michael how

612
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,640
you feeling did this leave up to the

613
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,080
dream we drummed up on that Zoom call so

614
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,279
many months almost years ago now we

615
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,559
surpassed any dream or Vision that I

616
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:58,440
could have thought

617
00:26:53,559 --> 00:27:00,559
of all that time ago it was uh full of

618
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,760
inspiring moments it was full of

619
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,480
inspiring stories and inspiring people

620
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,600
just seeing learning and all these

621
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,480
different contexts how it affects people

622
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,000
you know that are trying to get their

623
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,880
degree and just want to add some more

624
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,440
education or that are actually having to

625
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,399
flee their countries and still try to

626
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,919
figure out a way to make everything work

627
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,440
out in their lives um I hope that

628
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,480
highlighting these stories about humans

629
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,200
just like all of us from all over the

630
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,039
world really gives people a glass to

631
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,720
look through and see what their life

632
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,360
might be able to become I always

633
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,480
remember the first one of the first

634
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,760
calls we had with cat where he mentioned

635
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,440
that when they started all this when

636
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,000
they started ocw they thought their

637
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,320
biggest clientele was going to be the

638
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,120
teachers you know and it brings me back

639
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,399
to a quot I read somewhere once where

640
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,919
like when you create something and put

641
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,440
it out in the world you never know you

642
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,039
never know is going to use it you never

643
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,000
know how it's going to impact them you

644
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,480
never know and that's what I've Loved

645
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,679
about what this podcast has brought to

646
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,679
light in that his resources that are

647
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,279
open to everyone in all over the world

648
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,000
yes you know people are using them but

649
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:15,799
you don't know what for you don't know

650
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,840
how they're using them you don't know

651
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,240
what they're developing you don't know

652
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,600
how it's affecting their lives now that

653
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,519
we have a platform for at least people

654
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,360
to show us and tell us about that impact

655
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,480
it's something really I'm really loving

656
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,240
and I won't likee it's been a fun J it's

657
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,919
been more than anything I could have

658
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,919
expected more than anything I could have

659
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,360
asked for I'm even shocked we got here

660
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,519

661
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,960
stay tuned into mit's channels to learn

662
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,200
