The rates of improvement with generative

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,960
AI are unbelievably fast. I want to show

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,639
a series of images created by midjourney

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,280
over different generations of that

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,119
technology. So here's the prompt. Female

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,480
and male couple striking eyes and soft

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,960
lighting. So here we are in early 2022

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,279
with this response which to me is

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,279
frankly terrifying. This looks like the

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,560
stuff of a nightmare. This is nowhere

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,120
close to giving the user what they want.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,120
Second generation, okay, the shapes are

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,079
getting a little more recognizably

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
human. And then we start to see it hit

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,480
its stride. These are actually kind of

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,120
people, or at least a lot of them are.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,239
And then things just keep getting

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,399
better. It is very clear that generative

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,920
AI is a technology that's improving with

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,840
remarkable speed.
