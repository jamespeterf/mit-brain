1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,200
It is my pleasure uh to introduce not

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,040
one but two research scientists from

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:13,920
Kristen Ardley's lab. It's Amriita Soule

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,280
um and Amy Gulamett. Uh Amriita holds a

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,960
bachelor in science and a master of

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,199
science and life sciences from the

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,920
University of Mumbai and earned her PhD

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,320
in molecular biology and biochemistry

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,480
from Virginia Commonwealth University

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,920
where she studied DNA damage response

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,079
mechanisms in Christopher Valerie's lab.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,120
Amriita completed her post-doal training

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,440
at Yale University in Ranjet Bindra's

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
lab focusing on combination therapies

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,760
targeting DNA repair pathways in solid

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,559
tumors. She'll be talking first and then

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,120
following her will be Amy who obtained

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,840
her PhD in the autonomous University of

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,680
Barcelona Spain where she focused on

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,280
epigenetic de deregulation in

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,079
hematological malignancies. In 2014, she

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,560
started her first pd-al position in

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:10,720
Hulgar Hines lab focusing on uh single

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:15,600
cell sequencing technologies. In 2017,

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,439
she joined uh Burget Kokals lab at Dana

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
Farber Cancer Institute to study

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,600
resistance and T- cell acute

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,400
lymphoblastic leukemia and cartis cell

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
therapies. um applying the knowledge she

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,600
has gained and developed in Hular Haynes

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,479
lab.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,840
Okay, so let's get started. Please again

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,200
ask questions throughout with the

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,799
microphones and thank you. Uh thank you

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
Michelle and thank you for having us

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
here today. This is our very first time

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,040
at the MPG primer and we are very

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,840
excited to tell you guys all about the

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,799
developmental GTEx project. Uh before I

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
move on, I just want to thank um all the

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,119
donor families who have generously

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,439
gifted uh us such precious gifts to

43
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,200
support the important work. And just a

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,000
note that uh some of the slides will

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,040
have histology and tissue images.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,880
Okay. So um before I move on to

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,319
developmental GTEx project, I'm just

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,879
going to give you a quick overview of

49
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,040
the GTEx project which probably most of

50
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,520
you are aware of. So the GTEx project

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,920
which was launched in 2010 aimed to map

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,560
the effects of genetic variation on gene

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,640
expression uh on a broad a broad range

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,959
of tissues. The primary goal was to

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,040
improve the understanding of regulatory

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,680
mechanisms in complex traits and

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,599
diseases. GTEx collected over 50

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,879
different type of tissues in around

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,239
thousand postmortem adult donors and uh

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,080
they also developed protocols which were

61
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,080
um very standard operating protocols for

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,959
tissue collection processing as well as

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
facilitated uh open data sharing via the

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,400
GTEX portal. The gene expression and the

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,040
splicing data was mostly generated using

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,519
bulk RNA sequencing. Through this tools

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,640
we also identified uh cis and trans

68
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800
eqtlers altogether geek has been pretty

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,840
instrumental in linking genetic

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,040
variation to regulatory function and

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,200
thus helping researchers in um uh to

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,200
connect non-coding variants which make

73
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,800
up most of the G-W was heads and this

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
helps us to understand biological

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,319
mechanisms and disease pathways.

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
So all of the GTE work for most part um

77
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,800
generated whole genome sequencing data

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,040
and bulk RNA sequencing data. However,

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,959
with recent advances we have tools like

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,360
single cell RNA sequencing available to

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,000
us now. Uh technologies like these have

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,159
enabled profiling gene expression at a

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
resolution of individual cells offering

84
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,159
much deeper insights uh compared to the

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,040
bulkard seek. Um majority of efforts

86
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,599
like human cell atlas uh psych code hub

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,480
map ban and more are leveraging these

88
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,040
tools to systematically map transcrytoic

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,080
profiles across human tissues at

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,920
cellular level. Single cell seek as we

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,360
all know allows us to resolve cell tide

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840
states and even differentiation

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,560
trajectories within tissues. These

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,640
efforts by these consortiums however are

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,040
very important. However, most of these

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
focus on adult tissues and most do not

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,760
capture developmental trajectories.

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
There has been some effort uh by the

99
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,239
human developmental cell atlas uh to

100
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,880
which is beginning to fill these gaps.

101
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,959
Uh they focus only mainly on prenatal

102
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,600
tissues. However, these studies are

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,680
generally focused on sampling the same

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,840
tissue across multiple individuals as

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
opposed to multiple tissues from the

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,680
same donor which hampers hampers cross

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,400
tissue comparisons and investigations

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
into um effects of genetic variation on

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,680
gene expression.

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
So

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,080
there is a need for pediatric normal

112
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
reference data. As we know a

113
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,720
comprehensive understanding of normal

114
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,199
human development is critical for uh

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,040
uncovering origins of many diseases. A

116
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
number of inherited disorders from

117
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
congenital mal forations, heart defects,

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
neurodedevelopmental

119
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,040
disorders originate during gestation.

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,520
Additionally, there are pediatric

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,000
cancers which are believed to arise from

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,960
uh transient development cell types that

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,639
are not captured in adult data sets. Um

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,479
also both genetic and environmental

125
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,800
influences during early development can

126
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,360
predispose individuals to diseases that

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,960
manifest later in life.

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
All this underscores the need for

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,759
pediatric specific reference data sets

130
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,440
to accurately study disease mechanisms

131
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,960
and identify their developmental

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
origins.

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
So here I would like to introduce the

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,520
developmental GTEx project which was

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,120
designed to extend the foundational GTEx

136
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,600
resource by incorporating a

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,720
developmental dimension. While GTEx

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,479
focused on adult tissues, DGEX aims to

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
profile gene expression across key

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,600
stages of early human development. This

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,240
project will collect tissues from 120

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,520
postmot donors stratified into four

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,600
developmental age groups, infancy, early

144
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,160
childhood, pre-pubertal, and

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,639
post-pubertal. Each group will include

146
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
approximately 30 donors, enabling

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,919
cross-sectional analysis of gene

148
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,440
expression changes across developmental

149
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,960
stages and across tissues. This data

150
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,120
this data will support investigation

151
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
into eight specific gene regulation

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,639
developmental trajectories as well as

153
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,759
early origins of disease.

154
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,240
Now in par to the human collection, DGEX

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,240
includes a non-human primate arm to

156
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
enable cross species comparison of

157
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,960
development developmental gene

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,319
expression. We are sampling 126 reesus

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,240
macaks 72 marmicetses across a range of

160
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,120
developmental stages covering both

161
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,680
prenatal and postnatal periods. The

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,039
postnatal time points are aligned across

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,280
species between humans uh humans

164
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,199
marmicets and macaks

165
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,240
uh which allows comparative

166
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,319
developmental analysis. Importantly, the

167
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,639
prenatal non-human primate samples

168
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
provide rare and ethically feasibly

169
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
feasible access to developmental time

170
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,919
points which are not accessible easily

171
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
in humans. This design enables to better

172
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,240
understand conserved and species

173
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:09,039
specific aspects of primate development

174
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,479
especially during uh early life stages.

175
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,080
Now there is still a limited

176
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
understanding of how well regulatory

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,400
networks and developmental programs are

178
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,479
conserved between humans and non-human

179
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,880
parents. Most of what we know about

180
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,199
human biology both in normal and disease

181
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,240
state has been studied in model

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,319
organisms uh like rodins especially

183
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
mice. However, mice are evolutionary

184
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,880
distant from uh humans especially they

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,160
exhibit key developmental differences

186
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,039
during uh uh during early postnatal

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
stages. These these differences limit

188
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,360
their translational relevance of

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
findings. Um as we have seen in that in

190
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,759
some of the clinical trials which failed

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,520
despite having strong pre preclinical

192
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,960
data in rodent models. In contrast, NHP

193
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,960
share more similar developmental

194
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,039
trajectories in humans making them

195
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,440
critical reference for understanding

196
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,919
early human development and improving

197
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,919
disease modeling. Therefore,

198
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,319
establishing normal reference data in

199
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,400
NHPS will enhance our ability to

200
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,720
interpret human developmental data and

201
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,599
bridge gaps between model systems and

202
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,319
clinical research.

203
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,720
The NHP component of the DJEX project

204
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,879
includes two key primate models. The

205
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,120
Reus Macak which is also known as the

206
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,120
old world monkey and the common marmicet

207
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,800
which is known as the new world monkey.

208
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
Marmicetss have been widely used in

209
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,520
biomedical research due to their small

210
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,919
size um high reproductive reproductive

211
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,959
efficiency and their tendency to produce

212
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,560
dzygotic twins sharing a placenta a

213
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,120
feature valuable for developmental

214
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,480
studies. Recess macaks are the most

215
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,880
extensively used NHP u are most

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,000
extensively used in NHPS in research and

217
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,000
are phogetically very close to humans

218
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,399
especially uh comparable uterine and

219
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
placental structures. Together, these

220
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,399
two species offer complimentary

221
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
perspectives on primate development and

222
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,519
help model the conserved and divergent

223
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,240
aspects of human paragy.

224
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,920
Taken together to summarize uh the DGEX

225
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
project aims to build a comprehensive

226
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,120
reference atlas of normal tissues uh

227
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,279
across three species. Uh here we are

228
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,399
again uh just to recapture we are

229
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,120
profiling uh variety of tissues from 120

230
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
pediatric donors across four age groups

231
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,240
and um also recess makers and common

232
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,600
monets. The ultimate goal is to define

233
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,440
developmental and tissue specific

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,640
molecular patterns across these three

235
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,800
species for integrative analysis using u

236
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,519
a number of sophisticated tools like

237
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,920
bulk RNA seek single RNA seek whole

238
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,760
genome sequencing to help characterize

239
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,839
gene expression chromatin accessibility

240
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,839
and gene variation. I'll let Amy

241
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,839
continue.

242
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
Yes, thank you so much Amita for the

243
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
wonderful introduction to the

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
developmental GTEx project. Building

245
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,760
upon that, I'm going to dive into how we

246
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,760
actually acquire the critical human

247
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,839
samples for the project. Our human

248
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,080
sample collection relies on the network

249
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,640
of the organ procurement organizations

250
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,399
or OPOS's across the United States. We

251
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
part we partner with six of them

252
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,560
including connect life and life gift

253
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,079
amongst others. These OPOS's provide us

254
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
with significant amount of volume of

255
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,279
pediatric donors referrals to screen for

256
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,440
allegible donors.

257
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,920
Now once a potential donor is identified

258
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,320
by an OPO. The next critical step is to

259
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,160
determine donor allegibility. This

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,480
process is very rigorous and relies on

261
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,160
specific criteria. We don't reinvent the

262
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
wheel here. We actually leverage the

263
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
existing organ and tissue transplant

264
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,959
donor screening processes that the

265
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,040
OPOS's already have in place. This is

266
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,800
this structure approach provides donor

267
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,560
families the opportunity to consider

268
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,800
donation for the developmental GTEx

269
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
project. As you can see on the box on

270
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
the right, this outlines some of the key

271
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
inclusion and exclusion criteria that

272
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
guide our selection. Donors have to be

273
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
18 or younger. They have not received

274
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
blood transfusion within the 48 hours

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,959
amongst others. We also are collecting a

276
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,440
large amount of donor meta data. This

277
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,920
builds directly of best practices from

278
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,079
the original GTEx project. The

279
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,320
deidentified donor level data includes

280
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,079
credformation sex, demographic details,

281
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,160
comprehensive medical history, birth

282
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,640
circumstances, environmental exposure

283
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,640
amongst others.

284
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,920
So now once a donor is allegible and

285
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,640
media data is collected the crucial step

286
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,440
is the tissue sampling itself. First the

287
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,600
develment geek tissue sampling utilizes

288
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
common coordinate framework. This is

289
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,160
critical because enables reproducible

290
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,600
sampling across diverse sites diver

291
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,839
different donors and even different

292
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,079
species. This ensures that a sample

293
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,399
taken from say a spe a specific region

294
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,079
of the lung in one donor is comparable

295
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,920
to a sample from the same region in

296
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,399
another developmental stage of another

297
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,480
donor. Secondly, the collected tissue

298
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
sites and all the metadata gathered are

299
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,200
aligned with other consortiums as

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,839
Amarita mentioned before. Um so sampling

301
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,399
is performed by highly trained recovery

302
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,560
teams with introduction of diagrams and

303
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,800
images of as visual guides for tissue

304
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,040
procurement process to ensure the

305
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,959
highest quality on-site instruction by

306
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,279
dedicated pediatric pathologists is

307
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,160
consistently available at the OPOS's

308
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,079
throughout the project.

309
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,200
Now let's look at the s this the

310
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,120
specific SC sampling schema itself and

311
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,360
how it varies is based on the unique

312
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,600
size and structure. So in general most

313
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,399
tissue sites we aim to collect a small

314
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,959
standardized samples. For solid organs

315
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,959
as you uh we collect a 2x5 by 1x1 cube

316
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,440
and for mucosa organs we'll collect a

317
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,600
2x5x1 subitted in it full thickness of

318
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
the organ. Each of these samples is

319
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
divided into three alocors as you can

320
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,839
see in the image. Two of them will be

321
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,440
frozen for molecular analysis and one

322
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
will be fixed for hystopathological

323
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
evaluation. One key important aspect and

324
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,800
beauty of this project is that we will

325
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,959
maintain spatial orientation of these

326
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,800
tissues. So the frozen part is adjacent

327
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,920
to the fixed part and the fixed part is

328
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,680
adjacent to the other frozen part. So we

329
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
uh know specifically the orientation of

330
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,639
these tissues.

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,360
Okay. So however studying developmental

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,680
introduces a unique challenge. Organ

333
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,760
size changes significantly during

334
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,680
development. As you can see here on the

335
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,160
left, heart sampling schema changes from

336
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,839
birth to to adulthood where we'll be

337
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,399
collecting whole hearts and non-human

338
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,480
primates. And then for younger donors,

339
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,320
we'll be collecting sections and then

340
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
for older donors will be we'll be doing

341
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,120
subsections. Again, this is another

342
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
example of a testy sample uh where

343
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,800
younger donors will be collecting the

344
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,160
whole organ but as uh but it will

345
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,920
collect young donors will collect the

346
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,560
full organ but older donors the samples

347
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,320
will be sections.

348
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,480
Understanding and adapting to these

349
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
demental changes in organ size and

350
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,639
structure is vital to ensure that our

351
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,519
samples are truly comparable across the

352
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,440
entire fidactic age range allowing us to

353
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,720
accurately track developmental and gene

354
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,480
expression patterns.

355
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,079
While we cover the human side of

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,839
collection in detail, it's crucial to

357
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,720
also highlight the tissue sampling in

358
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,800
our non-human primate collection. Tissue

359
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,199
sampling for the non-human uh human

360
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,279
primate is designed to map the human

361
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,519
tissue sampling as much as possible

362
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,519
without with modifications from species

363
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,079
specific anatomical and developmental

364
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,959
differences. The human the non-human

365
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,440
primate won't be affected by donation.

366
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,920
So we'll have additional tissues. tissue

367
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,720
eskeemia is minimal because as soon as

368
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,839
uh as soon as sample collection begins

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,160
immediately uh from ethanasia we also

370
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,519
have uh as a marina mentioned before we

371
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,519
also be collecting prenatal samples

372
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,920
okay so now having discussed eligibility

373
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,680
and sampling protocols I want to

374
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,680
highlight the impressive scale and death

375
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,079
of tissues that were actually collected

376
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,839
in the developmental GTEx project for

377
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,440
the human donors on average we're

378
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,680
collecting 20 different different

379
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,120
tissues directly on site and then there

380
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,320
will have there will be secondary

381
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,760
dissection dissections up to 72

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,680
different tissue from a single donor. So

383
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,880
similar for the non-human primates we're

384
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,560
recovering up to 50 to 60 tissues and

385
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,360
then we'll have secondary dissections

386
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,440
that will go up to 80 distinct tissues

387
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
per animal.

388
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,839
As you can see here, we'll be collecting

389
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,839
the skin. Uh there's a comprehensive

390
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:37,680
list um uh the brain, the thyroid, the

391
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,360
pancreas. Um

392
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,199
so yes, so to maximize uh certain organs

393
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
will be recovered and whole like the

394
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,279
hearts, the lungs and the brains and

395
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
these will be sent out to specific

396
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,360
places where the heart will be sent out

397
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,000
to the children's to chop where it'll be

398
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,079
further subdissected. The lungs will be

399
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,079
sent to the University of Rochester for

400
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,240
sub dissection followed by the lung map

401
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,639
protocols and the brain will be sent to

402
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,639
the University of Maryland and then uh

403
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,880
further sub dissection to the University

404
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,880
of Yale.

405
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,600
Okay. So I want to take a step back and

406
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,160
provide a highle overview of the entire

407
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,000
developmental GTEx workflow. This

408
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,639
schematic details the comprehensive

409
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,120
journey of our samples from donor to

410
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,120
data to ultimate to discovery. As you

411
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,199
can see here, the workflow presented in

412
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,600
two parallel streams. The left side

413
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,360
outlines the process for human postmortm

414
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,920
donors where you can see we'll be

415
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,959
collecting 120 donors. All of our

416
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,680
samples will have pathology review. Then

417
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,240
uh then the the whole food organs will

418
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,320
be sent to us uh to the broader will be

419
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,000
bio banks and on the other on this on

420
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,560
the other side we'll have the non-human

421
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,120
primates the marmiss collection from MIT

422
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,279
and the makox from Oregon will be sent

423
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,240
to us at the broad where we'll bioank

424
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,800
them.

425
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,800
So yes I'm

426
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,640
thanks Amy. Can I ask a quick question?

427
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
Yes. Um we have anonymous attendee

428
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,799
online asking about if the cause of

429
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,120
death like kidney failure or cancer the

430
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,679
person um will this affect the results

431
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,679
or are they excluded

432
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,360
from from donate for donation? Yeah,

433
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,760
there's a whole list of eligibility

434
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,039
criteria. Yeah,

435
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,039
thank you. Yes. So as uh Amy described

436
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,679
the workflow spinner brother is

437
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,840
authorized and uh what kind of samples

438
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,480
are collected? There are some samples

439
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,799
which are uh collected fresh and they

440
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,160
have to be processed uh as soon as

441
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,320
possible. One of them is blood. Uh till

442
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,360
date we have collected around 44 disease

443
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,200
pediatric donors and for each donor we

444
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,840
obtained two types of blood samples.

445
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,320
Frozen blood which is frozen on site and

446
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,400
is usually primarily used for DNA

447
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,559
extraction which the downstream can be

448
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
used for whole genome sequence. We also

449
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,240
collect fresh blood. This blood is

450
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,760
shipped to abroad for downstream

451
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,760
processing. From this we isolate

452
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
luccoytes which are then used for single

453
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,559
cell RNA sequencing the profile gene

454
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,440
expression. Now it's very important to

455
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,840
evaluate sample quality uh or we need to

456
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,760
consider uh the sample quality and this

457
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,880
is dependent on three uh key time

458
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,440
points. Uh one of them being u when is

459
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
the blood collect what is the time from

460
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,520
the passing of the donor to the start of

461
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,360
the collection that has passed. uh then

462
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,600
time from sample collection to ship uh

463
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,520
to shipment initiation and time from

464
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,919
shipment to receipt and processing of

465
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,320
the blood. All these time variables are

466
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,880
crucial because delay in any of this can

467
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,760
actually hamper downstream RNA integrity

468
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,080
and does affect downstream uh data

469
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,720
quality. Faster turnaround helps

470
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,840
preserve uh transcript transcrytoic data

471
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,480
fidelity as well. Um this is at the

472
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,880
bottom an example of a donor. Here you

473
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,000
can see that uh 0 hour marks the time of

474
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,799
passing. Then after 20 hours uh the

475
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,799
blood was collected. 7 hours after that

476
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,760
the shipment was set up. And by the time

477
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,679
the blood reached broad 35 hours 47

478
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
minutes had shots. This changes from

479
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,520
donor to donor but this is just an

480
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,559
average uh time what it can take. Um we

481
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,640
receive blood at broad after hours on

482
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,960
weekends and the broad security assess

483
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,280
us. we can track the shipment and then

484
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,080
somebody from the lab uh retrieves the

485
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,559
blood and process it processes it u so

486
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,080
that we can uh make sure we take care of

487
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:37,919
it as soon as possible.

488
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,679
Now um when we actually so our goal uh

489
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,160
is that from the fresh blood we can

490
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,919
isolate uh white blood cells which are

491
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,919
also known as luccoytes. These are

492
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,520
critical component of the immune system

493
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,600
and help body basically fight

494
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
infections, inflammation and disease.

495
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,880
Although they make a small fraction of

496
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,559
the whole blood, they do have distinct

497
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,200
cell types like T- cells, B cells,

498
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,760
monocytes, um, NK cells and all your

499
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,440
granular sites. Um, they provide

500
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,160
basically a snapshot of the immune

501
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,480
activity in the body of the donor at the

502
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,840
time of sampling. In pediatric donors

503
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,919
especially, it can help us to understand

504
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,880
how immune system develops, responds to

505
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,160
stimuli or maybe um or how it may be

506
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,320
altered in a disease. Now after we

507
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,720
receive fresh blood samples in the lab,

508
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,880
our first step is to get rid of all the

509
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,679
red blood cells, we do this by a

510
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,039
magnetic separation. Um this helps us to

511
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,840
enrich WBC's and also um get rid of all

512
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,320
the noise that could uh come from RBC's.

513
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,960
Once RBC's are depleted, the enriched

514
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,159
WBC suspension is processed through this

515
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,640
honeycomb hive capture assembly. These

516
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,200
are basically these uh contraptions you

517
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,600
see on the left bottom corner where each

518
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,919
of these contraptions has wells in which

519
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,640
individual white blood cells are

520
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,360
captured and then uh and they each

521
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,280
receive a unique unique molecular bar.

522
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
Once the cells are captured they can be

523
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,760
stored for a long time in in the

524
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,360
negative AT and um we can then basically

525
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,120
process them in batches. We don't have

526
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,679
to process the downstream single cell

527
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,520
RNA sequencing per per donor. we can

528
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,120
have them as a batch and then process

529
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,520
them. Um, one good thing about this uh

530
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,039
hive assay is that it also helps us

531
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,159
preserve granular sites which are often

532
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:25,840
lost by uh uh other traditional methods.

533
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,440
We also do uh uh PBMC isolation and

534
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,480
storage for the non-human private

535
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,799
species um which are done um so the

536
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,159
marmicets are done at broad and the

537
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:40,159
macak blood is processed in um Oregon

538
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,480
another in addition to blood we are also

539
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,280
collecting uh skin tissue samples from

540
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,200
donors to isolate fibroblast. So when we

541
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,480
receive a skin sample we basically and

542
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,120
this also is received at the same time

543
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
as blood. So once we receive the skin we

544
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,039
start by carefully trimming the skin

545
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,520
sample, reming the fat and then this

546
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,919
tissue is then cut into small pieces and

547
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,280
allowed to adhere on a petri dish on a

548
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,520
gel matrix. Um you do a regular cell

549
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,200
culture change media do like a single

550
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,320
passage so that you obtain primary

551
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,280
culture and once at uh a correct

552
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,120
confluency uh we can cryopreserve these

553
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,440
fibroblasts and these are biog.

554
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,000
Now these fiber was cultures basically

555
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,400
allow us to use in downstream functional

556
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,919
assays. We can reprogram them to uh

557
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,120
IPSC's. Um also these are uh important

558
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,720
resources that reflect the living cells.

559
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,320
They basically reflect donor's genetic

560
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,559
and environmental history in form of

561
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,559
living cells.

562
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,400
Um another thing Amy mentioned is that

563
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,559
all the tissues what we collect um are

564
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,159
they undergo pathological review. So we

565
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,159
collect a frozen tissue and then we have

566
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,080
a fixed tissue another frozen one. So

567
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,919
the fixed tissue all the fixed tissue

568
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,640
samples undergo detailed review by a

569
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,720
pathologist. The review serves um

570
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
multiple critical functions from initial

571
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,880
quality control, tissue identity as well

572
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,039
as quality assessment. So in the initial

573
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,840
quality control, the pathologist

574
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,360
verifies that the label tissue matches

575
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,960
what's actually on the slide.

576
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,120
Misidentification can compromise

577
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,280
downstream data analysis. So the tissue

578
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,200
mismatch is verified. They also check

579
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,960
for orientation issues if the tissue was

580
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
embedded or sectioned in a way that

581
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,280
might limit interpretability.

582
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,400
Uh then it's a technical uh slide

583
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,320
quality issues just to over overall look

584
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,679
at the quality of histologology slide

585
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,880
including staining quality, tissue

586
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,360
folding, section thickness etc. Once the

587
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,280
initial QC is complete, the pathologist

588
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,840
evaluates the biological quality of the

589
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,919
tissue. Each tissue gets an atysis

590
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,280
score. This indicates how much

591
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,200
postmortem degradation has occurred.

592
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,679
Highlyssis can obscure tissue

593
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
architecture and limited TP. Adolysis

594
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
score is usually given from a scale of 0

595
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,400
to three. Zero being good and three

596
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,159
being bad. The pathologist also looks

597
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,880
for the presence of target versus

598
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,480
non-target tissues to make sure that uh

599
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,440
the slide actually has the intended

600
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,799
organ or a structure. um and sometimes

601
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,240
an un unintended occur due to collection

602
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,720
error or an or anatomic uh proximity.

603
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,400
We also look for signs of any diseases,

604
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,559
inflammation or abnormal development

605
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,880
which was not uh known prior to

606
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,120
collection. And last but not the least,

607
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
maturation assessment for pediatric

608
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,960
samples in particular. Evaluating

609
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,840
developmental stages can provide

610
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
important context for interpretation.

611
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,799
After all these assessment the

612
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,200
pathological final review determination

613
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,440
is performed and then we decide if this

614
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,760
tissue is suitable for downstream

615
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,480
applications.

616
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,320
Now um the different tissues are um

617
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
reviewed by pathologists at different

618
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,120
centers. The University of Maryland

619
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
brain bank tissue review scans from uh

620
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,320
NHP and non-human brains. uh all the

621
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,240
non-brain human tissues are uh reviewed

622
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:04,480
at CHOP and the non-brain uh uh NHP

623
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,320
tissues are reviewed at NPRC Oregon.

624
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm just going to uh show you this one

625
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,960
example as to uh what information we can

626
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,279
gather from uh histology slides across

627
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,440
development. So in the top panel you can

628
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,120
see that um the slide show the

629
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,840
development uh developmental progression

630
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,919
of globilli in kidney in maca kidney

631
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,679
spanning from gestational age 50 to an

632
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,600
adult in GD50. Um you can see that the

633
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,400
kidney is in early developmental stage.

634
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,400
There are no mature gli yet but renal

635
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,400
vesicles and chromma shaped bodies are

636
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,679
starting to form.

637
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,840
At GD00 uh gladilogenesis is actively

638
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,840
underway. we can identify some S-shaped

639
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,320
bodies. GD50 which is um a late

640
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,640
gestational stage for Macak glumberi

641
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,279
become more defined and as we move from

642
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,760
neonate infant juvenile to adult we can

643
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,799
see that glumberi are fully mature and

644
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,200
functionally stable. These slides will

645
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,960
help us visualize um and understand

646
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,039
developing organs and their highly

647
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,240
organized and fully functional uh

648
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,559
aspects across ages. Um so we are

649
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,840
basically cataloging this uh across a

650
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,799
range of tissues in NHPS and humans and

651
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,640
this is going to be a very important um

652
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,159
uh aspect of information which will

653
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,159
eventually be available to the

654
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,159
community.

655
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,880
So building upon that we're now going to

656
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,159
transition to the diverse uh types of

657
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,720
data that will be generated from the

658
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,799
developmental GTEx project. As mentioned

659
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,400
earlier, all tissues are biobback and

660
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,559
every collected tissue under goes a

661
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,159
detailed hisystologology imaging. So we

662
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,240
will be generating whole genome

663
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,640
sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, long

664
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,559
read sequencing, single cell technology

665
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,559
such as the multi where you obtain the

666
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,279
gene expression attack as well as

667
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,840
methylation uh assays and various

668
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,159
special single cell sequencing

669
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,080
techniques.

670
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,840
So all of our donors will receive a

671
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,919
whole genome sequencing to provide a

672
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,600
complete genetic blueprints. This will

673
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,919
allow to identify inherit genetic

674
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,919
variation, improve genome and isopform

675
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,760
structure annotation and enable genetic

676
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,679
demultiplexing if samples are batched

677
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,240
together.

678
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,840
So we will also be performing bulk RNA

679
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,120
seek on the majorities of tissues

680
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,919
collected. So so far we have sequenced

681
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,880
to date 264 samples from 31 donors and

682
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,440
46 different tissues in humans. 262

683
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,720
samples from 27 donors and 61 tissues in

684
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,240
Makox. and 237 samples from 18 donors

685
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,360
and 59 tissues in marmma sets. So just

686
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,480
uh an a quick overview of the PCA plot

687
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,480
and plot where we obtain a separation of

688
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,720
the different tissues indicating the

689
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,120
high quality across the data in the

690
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,200
species.

691
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,200
So another assay that we're going to

692
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,679
perform it will be fulllength RNA

693
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,760
sequencing using mass iso seek to

694
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,240
enhance our understanding of isoforms

695
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,640
throughout uh developments. This method

696
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,399
was developed here at the broad by Aziz

697
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,399
and we've already performed a pilot

698
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,600
study where we uh where we took 12

699
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,120
humans six marmicets in Makox uh

700
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,720
different tissues in different age

701
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,320
ranges and as you can see in the heat

702
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,000
map we already have um tissue type that

703
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,080
drives primary clustering and a

704
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,840
secondary clustering driving by species.

705
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,399
So there's a lot of biology to be

706
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,399
discovered here.

707
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,240
So another core assay that we'll be

708
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,760
doing is single cell sequencing where

709
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,039
we'll be profiling from the same single

710
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,360
cell the gene expression and the

711
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,159
chromatin accessibility using 10x

712
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,720
genomics. So other assays u gene

713
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,640
expression and attack the 10x uh multi

714
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,640
will be our core assay but we will also

715
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,840
be doing single cell methylation and

716
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,919
spatial transcript on some on some on on

717
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,919
some of them. So these powerful

718
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,600
technologies move us beyond bold

719
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,120
averages providing unprecedented

720
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,760
position to map development at the

721
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,919
cellular level.

722
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,159
So just to elaborate on our core high

723
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,840
resolution assay. This slide provides a

724
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,640
brief overview of the 10x genomics

725
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,559
motion a technology a technology central

726
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,960
to the developmental geeks where we'll

727
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,159
be linking gene expression and chromatin

728
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,840
accessibility from the same nuclei. So

729
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,960
briefly for those who don't know the

730
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,279
technology, you take frozen tissue, you

731
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,279
isolate the nuclei. Each tissue requires

732
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,520
a specific protocol u for isolation. Um

733
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,080
once you obtain the nuclei, you perform

734
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,080
the 10x multiome which is by doing

735
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,840
droplets of single cell. You will then

736
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,240
perform the libraries attack gene

737
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,760
expression and you will obtain the gene

738
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,880
expression and the chromatin

739
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,720
accessibility of that nuclei.

740
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,440
So as mentioned earlier so this will be

741
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
our main core production but uh we are

742
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,320
in parallel uh doing the same

743
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,039
experiments at Yale University.

744
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,200
So as Amita mentioned before the tissue

745
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,200
that we will be doing performing single

746
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,960
cell sequencing has to be of high

747
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:05,440
quality uh high quality data. So um we

748
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,279
will select tissues that have a high RQS

749
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,000
score and that have a good autosis

750
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,240
score. And then on the lab side

751
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,480
validation of uh for good data will be

752
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,880
intact nuclei and the traces we obtain

753
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,880
from those libraries.

754
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,520
So we will be generating a beautiful

755
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,120
multi-home data sets where we'll be

756
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,240
create we will we'll be having the three

757
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,279
species we'll select two age ranges the

758
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,000
young and the older side and where we

759
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,559
have matched the tissue types. So we

760
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,840
will be generating 10x motion data on

761
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,720
all of these brain regions amydala

762
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,679
talamus hypothalamus cerebellum and

763
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,240
kidney pituitary muscle quadriceps lung

764
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,799
liver thyroid muscle and adrenal gland.

765
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,360
This is going to be a beautiful data set

766
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,559
where we'll see a lot of biology within

767
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,520
tissues and within species.

768
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,520
Here's just a glimpse of a data set that

769
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,760
we've generated. So this is a kidney

770
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,279
sample where we did 10x motiome where

771
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,320
you get the gene expression and the

772
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,159
attack. Here you can see uh beautiful

773
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
clustering both in the gene expression

774
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,799
and the attack where we get high number

775
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,919
of genes per cell high number of high

776
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,200
number of of of cells. Uh and for the

777
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,720
attack metrics we get good good TSS uh

778
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,679
score. So this is human kidney uh and

779
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,640
high frag uh fragmentation high quality

780
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,559
uh overlapping peaks. So this is just a

781
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,720
glimpse of the kind of data we'll be

782
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,720
getting from the from the 10x genomics

783
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,799
multihome.

784
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,399
So as mentioned before another workflow

785
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,159
that we'll we'll be performing will be

786
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,360
methylation profiling at the single cell

787
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,559
level using skil skill biotechnologies.

788
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,480
So again briefly you isolate the nuclei

789
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,279
you fix them then you perform

790
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,760
combinatorial indexing isopy sequencing

791
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,600
again you barcode them you sequence them

792
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,840
and then you analyze them. So we

793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,760
performed a pilot data set on kidney

794
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,039
where we got two younger donors and two

795
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,519
older donors and we performed this assay

796
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,120
and we're still looking into the data

797
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,080
but you can already see beautiful

798
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,240
biology where there's a specific infant

799
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,200
cluster that uh that is specific only to

800
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,039
the younger donors. So there's a lot to

801
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,679
be discovered in these data sets. We're

802
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,679
really looking forward to it.

803
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,600
And lastly, we'll be performing spatial

804
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,919
assays to understand tissue organization

805
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,840
and cell interactions. For the spatial

806
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,799
assays, we have tried slide tags on

807
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,720
kidney again on the same uh on human

808
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,399
kidney. So, briefly with this

809
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,880
technology, you place a section of

810
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,000
tissue on the sequence spatial barcoded

811
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,399
array. You tag your nuclei uh with photo

812
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,559
cleave spatial barcodes. You isolate the

813
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,640
nuclei and you perform 10x genomics

814
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,399
where you'll capture the mRNA and the

815
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,960
special barcodes.

816
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,200
Um with this BA with this pilot as we

817
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,600
took the kidney we placed one of these

818
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,640
arrays on the medulla and on the cortex

819
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,679
and as you can see here we have a Disney

820
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,760
plot on the medulla and on the cortex

821
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,360
where you can see the specific uh

822
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,840
different subtypes from the different

823
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,880
anatomical region. Again a lot of

824
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,799
biology to be discovered.

825
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,519
So what are the outcomes of this big

826
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,159
project? So tissue collection and data

827
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,000
generation are currently ongoing. Um

828
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,720
data and pipelines will be available on

829
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,399
the GTEx portal. On the portal, you'll

830
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,880
be able to select the data uh for

831
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,880
interactive visualizations and all

832
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,480
tissues will be biobanked for future

833
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,200
reference

834
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,600
for future research purposes.

835
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,519
And um

836
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,240
to conclude to bring it all together,

837
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,080
the Derto GTEx projects represents an

838
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,840
unparalleled effort to transform our

839
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,720
understanding of pediatric development

840
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,240
and its evolutionary foundations. It is

841
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,000
crucial to remember that pediatric

842
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
tissues are fundamentally different from

843
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,039
adult tissues. They have uniquely cell

844
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,240
type compos compositions and distinct

845
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,679
physiology to study the evolutionary

846
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,760
conservation and differences of

847
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,839
developmental programs between humans

848
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,919
and non-human primates. And the

849
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,280
developmental geoteex project will prov

850
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,919
will provide a groundwork and

851
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,919
infrastructure for many research studies

852
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,480
for example hallucinating the origins of

853
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,639
pediatric diseases, childhood cancers to

854
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,440
developmental disorders. Everything that

855
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,520
we presented here today um is uh we we

856
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,200
wrote a marker paper that describes all

857
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,800
of the project. If you're interested in

858
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,119
learning more about it, what tissues

859
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,560
will be subsampling, the exclusion and

860
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,599
exclusion criteria that was asked

861
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,760
before, that's also in the paper um that

862
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:48,240
you can find online.

863
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,639
So the most important I want to uh

864
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,359
acknowledge and we're extremely grateful

865
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,599
to the dilemma GTEx donor's families who

866
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,160
have generously provided such precious

867
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,000
gifts to support our research work uh as

868
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,920
well as all of the non-human primate

869
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,960
collection

870
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,839
and uh the develment gist consortium. It

871
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,520
is amazing to work with such a a big

872
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,000
team and all of our broad colleagues

873
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,320
here at the uh at the at the broad and

874
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,200
our industry collaborators. So yes,

875
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,200
thank you very much any

876
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,920
questions.

877
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,200
Um two questions. one before I'm curious

878
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,000
about how the proof is going. Um, is

879
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,280
that being a bottleneck and are you

880
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,720
getting to be picky about maybe like

881
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,119
having some other dimensions of

882
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,880
diversity on stage in your data set? And

883
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,119
the other is I'm just feeling so aware

884
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,599
that this is 120 dead children, many of

885
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,520
you. Yeah. And and those families and

886
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,359
I'm wondering is there a plan for kind

887
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,880
of ongoing relationships with those

888
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,480
families giving you updates about the

889
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,079
project?

890
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,079
Yeah, there is a thank you for the

891
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,599
question. So, uh I'll answer the second

892
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,160
question first. So, we actually have an

893
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,160
LC initiative where basically they

894
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,960
connect back to the families and they

895
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,480
are informing them how their gifts are,

896
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,640
what are we trying to do with them. So,

897
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,640
there's a constant communication aspect.

898
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,240
So, there's actually also LC paper which

899
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,800
they're going to publish soon which

900
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,760
talks about these efforts and uh your

901
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
first question was how is the

902
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,760
recruitment going? So I think uh it's

903
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,839
very difficult because also getting

904
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,119
consent because of the age of donors

905
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:32,000
it's not very easy. So uh sometimes for

906
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,640
a couple of months there is a quiet but

907
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,599
sometimes we do see a lot of donors in a

908
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,160
month. So it's up and down. Yeah. And uh

909
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,440
as you said it's 120 donors pediatric

910
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,359
it's it's hard. Yeah. But it's very

911
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,760
precious and we do appreciate everything

912
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,400
we get.

913
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,040
Uh, we have a question online from Ben

914
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Weisberg. Um, I'll ask them one at a

915
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,560
time because I know it's hard to deal

916
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
when there's multi-part questions. Um,

917
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,160
will the DNA be sequenced with long

918
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,400
reads?

919
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,400
You know,

920
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,960
but uh I think it all depends on and

921
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,040
what biological interest. As we get more

922
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,400
data, I think we'll have more questions.

923
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,960
self. And then another question uh Ben

924
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,160
asks is when do you anticipate the first

925
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,160
release of data to the portal?

926
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,839
I it still do you know I mean because

927
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,400
it's when the 10x single cell data and

928
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,680
then we have the RNA ready to release.

929
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,160
So I think the plan is so right is going

930
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,599
through thorough QC. We have generated a

931
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,960
lot of data. uh a bunch of our

932
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,359
computational people in the team are

933
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,640
doing thorough QC and then the hope is

934
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,720
to generate uh release it uh sometime

935
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,200
this year I don't want to say next month

936
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,760
but it's it's this year and then the

937
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,320
last uh question from Ben is if they

938
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,560
already have their own access to GTE to

939
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,720
just GTEX will they automatically have

940
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,400
access to DGEX

941
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,800
um or is there a separate application

942
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,119
process to access the data we'll defer

943
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,599
that to our PI question.

944
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,880
Um, are there any other questions? We

945
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,880
don't have any other ones online yet.

946
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,480
Come to the mic.

947
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,720
So um I was wondering you know how you

948
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,960
said that you have fresh blood too and

949
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,640
we also say that similar to a small and

950
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,560
digitex I think these ones they don't

951
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,119
have pre-existing um disease mostly so

952
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,079
and the time like to get the sample in

953
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,560
30 hours to broad so I think I know it's

954
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,720
a very hard situation when that thing

955
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,640
happen I was wondering if the families

956
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,640
they register even at the time that the

957
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,040
kid is born like how can they say that

958
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,280
this is going to happen if there is no

959
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,760
pre-existing issue to deliver the sample

960
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,920
that quickly.

961
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,599
So you're saying that how do we know if

962
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,359
there are any pre-existing conditions in

963
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,200
the blood? I'm not Yeah, because I think

964
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,839
I saw in one of the slides that it takes

965
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,680
about 30 hours to get the sample and

966
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,119
then so we do look at viability and of

967
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,520
the blood and then there are certain

968
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,680
like for example the hive assays they

969
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,800
recommend oh the viability should be say

970
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,320
75 to 80%. Sometimes it's 60. We'll

971
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,359
still proceed because it's such a

972
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,359
precious sample and uh a whole range of

973
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,760
cerology is done to all these samples.

974
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,440
So we know if there are any like they're

975
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,280
screened for infectious diseases and

976
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,599
everything. So but we we have some

977
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,480
information on that when we see samples.

978
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,480
Does that somehow answer? Yeah. And the

979
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,240
second do we have any other question or

980
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,040
should I so um so the frozen tissues

981
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,000
they're going to degrade right? And I

982
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,400
think they they create it or no?

983
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,240
So no, there's a process put in place

984
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,880
when when there's the the donation um

985
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,760
tissue is collected and it's they follow

986
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,599
everything is like on frozen trays that

987
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,200
you don't lose a chain of cold. So

988
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,640
everything is like when they send them

989
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,040
there's in dry ice when they come here

990
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,960
to pro they're put in minus 80. So

991
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,880
there's no degradation.

992
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,359
I mean you do have a lie between

993
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,119
starting collection but uh that's why

994
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,520
we're doing all of the pathology to make

995
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,880
sure that the essays assay that we do is

996
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,880
highly good quality data. So there is a

997
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,599
control and and the eskeemic time is set

998
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,200
to be not to not exceed 24 hours. Yeah.

999
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,119
So that is already in place and only the

1000
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,920
fresh blood is shipped on ice. The the

1001
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,480
the tissues get frozen right there. So

1002
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,040
they so you can hope that the RNA

1003
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,800
degradation stops there. Great. Thank

1004
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,880
you. Impressive work. Thank you.

1005
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,599
I've got a question. Um, thinking about

1006
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,400
denovo mutations and sematic mutations.

1007
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,800
Uh, do you have the ability to genotype

1008
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,960
the parents of the child? I might have

1009
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,160
missed it in the beginning. That's a

1010
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:00,720
that's a great question. Uh,

1011
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,720
yeah, not no plans yet, but to be seen.

1012
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Yeah,

1013
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,760
I can ask another question then. then

1014
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,599
people probably want to get back to

1015
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,839
their stuff. I was really impressed

1016
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,920
about the multiome being the core assay

1017
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,400
rather than just single nucleus RNA

1018
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,720
seek. Um is there plans to I guess I was

1019
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,359
wondering also about the the idea to do

1020
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,680
both bulk and single cell? How did you

1021
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,240
pick how much you're going to spend to

1022
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,920
bulk versus single cell or why not just

1023
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,160
put every all your money in the single

1024
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:38,319
cell pot? Very you need a lot of money.

1025
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,240
the it's expensive assay. So bulk is is

1026
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,160
affordable. So they want to do on all

1027
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,480
the tissues the bulk and then we'll

1028
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,640
focus on we'll do this pilot and then

1029
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,640
we'll focus on biological questions to

1030
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,400
continue on with the single cell assets.

1031
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,760
But yes, if we could do all the tissues

1032
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,599
and all that would be amazing to do

1033
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,240
single cell but we're doing quite a bit

1034
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,880
now. Yeah. Yeah. It's a balance between

1035
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,640
a good design versus how much the

1036
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,319
expenses. Yeah. And just out of

1037
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,920
curiosity, what is the total budget? I

1038
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,640
might have missed it at the beginning.

1039
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,640
What is the total budget? I think you

1040
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,160
can get on the NIH. It's public. It's

1041
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,960
publicly available. Yeah, because it

1042
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,400
involves a whole range of things from

1043
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,040
donor like authorization collection. So,

1044
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,119
it's in the NIH website.

1045
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,200
I see. So, you don't know what it is.

1046
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,720
Did I know? No, I don't. Yeah. Yeah. I

1047
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,040
can look it up later, but I don't know.

1048
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,040
I don't know.

1049
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,240
Any other remaining questions? We do

1050
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,880
have a little bit of time, but I know

1051
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,560
people like to enjoy their breakfast.

1052
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,560
Um,

1053
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,079
all right. I just want to say thank you

1054
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,960
to Rachel who's in the audience because

1055
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,000
she showed us the fiberglass culture and

1056
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,200
yeah, so thank you. I just

1057
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,800
Yeah. So, I mean, it's been great

1058
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,079
collaborating with everybody at Broad

1059
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,599
because when we started the project,

1060
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,440
there was a lot of things which we were

1061
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,680
learning. So, people have been extremely

1062
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,359
helpful.

1063
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,720
The broad community is amazing. So,

1064
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,560
thank you for everybody. Yeah. Yes.

1065
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,560
Wonderful. And on that very high note,

1066
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,560
let's thank our speakers again.
