00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,399
to climate action and dealing with the

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,239
partly Technical and partly driven by

with so many of the items we interact

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,520
with in our daily lives from soap to

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,640
baking soda to fertilizer deriving from

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,720
products of the chemical industry the

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,799
sector has become a major source of

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,720
economic activity and employment for

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,360
Many Nations including the United States

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
and China but as the global demand for

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,200
chemical products continues to grow so

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,200
do the industry's emissions new

sustainable chemical production methods

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,360

current emission intensive chemical

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,640

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,000
reconsidered urge the authors of a new

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,320
paper published in Jewel researchers

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,320
from DC Muse a multi-institution

45
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,360
research initiative argue that

46
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,000
electrification powered by low carbon

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,479
sources should be viewed more broadly as

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
a viable decarbonization pathway for the

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,759
chemical industry in this paper they

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,880
shine a light on different potential

51
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,719
methods to do just set generally the

52
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,960
perception is that electrification can

53
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,239
play a role in this sector in a very

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,640
narrow sense and that it can replace

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,599
fossil fuel combustion by providing the

56
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,120
heat that the combustion is providing

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,200
says Mala prata a member of DC Muse what

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,879
we argue is that electrification could

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,440
be much more than that the researchers

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,680
outlined four technological Pathways

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,120
ranging from more mature near-term

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,599
options to less technologically mature

63
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,400
options in need of research invest

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,160
and present the opportunities and

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,519
challenges associated with each the

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,480
first two Pathways directly substitute

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,480
fossil fuel produced heat which

68
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,920
facilitates the reactions inherent in

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,720
chemical production with electricity or

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,720
electrochemically generated hydrogen the

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,080
researchers suggests that both options

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,080
could be deployed now and potentially be

73
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,200
used to retrofit existing facilities

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,280
electrolytic hydrogen is also

75
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,400
highlighted as an opportunity to replace

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,159
fossil fuel produced hydrogen

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,280
a process that emits carbon dioxide as a

78
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,200
critical chemical feed stock in 2020

79
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,560
fossil-based hydrogen supplied nearly

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,720
all hydrogen demand 90 megatons in the

81
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,280
chemical and refining Industries

82
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,080
hydrogen's largest consumers the

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,200
researchers note that increasing the

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
role of electricity and decarbonizing

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,640
the chemical industry will directly

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,120
affect the decarbonization of the power

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
grid they stress that to successfully

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,760
Implement these Technologies their

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,120
operation must coordinate with the power

90
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,560
grid in a mutually beneficial manner to

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
avoid overburdening it if we're going to

92
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,680
be serious about decarbonizing the

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,560
sector and relying on electricity for

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,680
that we have to be creative in how we

95
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,760
use it says melaga otherwise we run the

96
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,680
risk of having addressed one problem

97
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,239
while creating a massive problem for the

98
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,239
Grid in the process electrified

99
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,239
processes have the potential to be much

100
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,760
more flexible than conventional fossil

101
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,400
fuel driven processes this can reduce

102
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
the cost of chemical production by

103
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,280
allowing producers to shift electricity

104
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,120
consumption to times when the cost of

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,040
electricity is low process flexibility

106
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,480
is particularly impactful during

107
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,280
stressed power grid conditions and can

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,280
help better accommodate renewable

109
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,280
generation resources which are

110
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,680
intermittent and are often poorly

111
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,199
correlated with daily power grid Cycles

112
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,400
says Yuri dorin an associate research

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,040
professor at the John's Hopkins Ralph o

114
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,080
Conor sustainable energy Institute it's

115
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,680
beneficial for potential adopters

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,800
because it can help them avoid consum

117
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,320
consuming electricity during high price

118
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,520
periods dvorin adds that some

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,960
intermediate energy carriers such as

120
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,840
hydrogen can potentially be used as

121
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,080
highly efficient energy storage for

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,440
day-to-day operations and as long-term

123
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,560
energy storage this would help support

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
the power grid during extreme events

125
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,600
when traditional and renewable

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,759
generators may be unavailable the

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,000
application of long duration storage is

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,720
of particular interest as this is a key

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
enabler of a low emission society yet

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,479
not widespread beond pumped Hydro units

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,720
he says however as we envision

132
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,360
electrified chemical manufacturing it is

133
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,520
important to ensure that the supplied

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,240
electricity is sourced from low emission

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,000
generators to prevent emissions leakages

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,320
from the chemical to power sector the

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,800
next two Pathways introduced utilizing

138
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,759
electrochemistry and plasma are less

139
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,759
technologically mature but have the

140
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,919
potential to replace energy and carbon

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,120
intensive thermochemical processes

142
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,280
currently used in the industry by

143
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,639
adopting electrochemical process or

144
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,360
plasma driven reactions instead chemical

145
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
Transformations can occur at lower

146
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,600
temperatures and pressures potentially

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,680
enhancing efficiency these reaction

148
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Pathways also have the potential to

149
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,800
enable more flexible grid responsive

150
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,840
plants and the deployment of modular

151
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,039
manufacturing plants that leverage

152
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,440
distributed chemical feed stocks such as

153
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,960
biomass waste further enhancing

154
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,880
sustainability and chemical

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,680
barrier to deep decarbonization of

160
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,720
chemical manufacturing relates to its

161
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,759
complex multi-product nature but

162
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,960
according to the researchers each of

163
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
these electricity driven Pathways

164
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,639
supports chemical industry

165
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,919
decarbonization for various feedstock

166
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,599
choices and endof life disposal

167
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,400
decisions each should be evaluated and

168
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,759
comprehensive technoeconomic and

169
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,080
environmental life cycle assessments to

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,919
and performance

172
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,639
metrics regardless of the pathway chosen

173
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,440
the researchers stressed the need for

174
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,840
active research and development and

175
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,360
deployment of these Technologies they

176
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,280
also emphasize the importance of

177
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,400
Workforce training and development

178
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,960
running in parallel to technology

179
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,560
development as Andre Taylor the director

180
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,680
of DC Muse explains there is a healthy

181
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,720
skepticism in the industry regarding

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,919
electrification and Adoption of these

183
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,680
Technologies as it involves processing

184
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,479
chemicals in a new way the workforce at

185
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,160
different levels of the industry hasn't

186
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,360
necessarily been exposed to ideas

187
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,280
related to the Grid electrochemistry or

188
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,000
plasma the researchers say that

189
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,560
Workforce training at all levels will

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,319
help build greater confidence in these

191
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,520
different solutions and support

192
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,440
customer-driven industry adoption

193
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,199
