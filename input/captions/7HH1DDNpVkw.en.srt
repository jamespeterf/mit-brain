1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,610

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,390
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,870
It's really nice to
see you all here.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,670
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,270
I'm Nergis Mavalvala and I'm the
Dean of the School of Science

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,770
here at MIT.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,290
I share President
Kornbluth's excitement

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,080
and wonder at all that we have
achieved in the life sciences

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,220
at MIT over the past decade.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,890
MIT has been a place where
fundamental knowledge

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,480
and understanding
of biology happens,

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,980
where rapid conversion
from ideas to discovery

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,350
to translation happens, where
computation and policy meet

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,520
science and engineering
comfortably,

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,940
where innovation is
a natural destination

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,290
on the journey from
discovery to societal impact.

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,140
As well as we do all of this,
as you heard from Sally,

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,910
we know we can do better.

19
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,790
And I couldn't be more energized
to be here with you today

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,270
to celebrate and
dream of the future

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,840
that the MIT HEALS
Collaborative will help create.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,460
By catalyzing collaborations
in fields like immunology,

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,030
neuroscience, AI,
sustainability, and healthcare,

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,680
and strengthening MIT's
ties with Boston's

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,890
extraordinary hospitals
and industry leaders

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,340
in biotech and pharma, the
MIT HEALS Collaborative

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,700
aims to spur discoveries
with broad and lasting

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,440
real-world impact.

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,260
Now, you couldn't come
up with a better example

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,310
that aligns with those ideals
than our very own Dr. Phil

31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,300
Sharp.

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,760
He has been at the vanguard, not
only of scientific discovery,

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,130
but also MIT's collaborations
with biotech, biopharma,

34
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,020
the healthcare industry,
his entire career.

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, before I tell you
a bit more about Phil,

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,230
let me say a few words about how
the MIT HEALS Collaborative came

37
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,280
about.

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,370
It does involve Phil,
as many wonderful things

39
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,220
that happen in the life
sciences at MIT does.

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,655
Little over three years ago,
at the instigation of many wise

41
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:03,280
colleagues and friends of MIT--
and many of you are in the room

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,640
here today--

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,990
Dean Chandrakasan and I
charged a faculty-led committee

44
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,970
to study what we
might do better,

45
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,460
to coordinate all the fabulous
but disparate work in the life

46
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,740
sciences being
carried out at MIT,

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,610
and also how might we
better nurture and curate

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,100
collaborations with
the life sciences

49
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,030
research being carried out
in the biotech and hospitals

50
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,090
around us.

51
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,950
That study, led by professors
Tyler Jacks and Kristala

52
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,090
Prather, culminated
in the VITALS report.

53
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,410
VITALS stands for Vision to
Integrate, Translate and Advance

54
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,000
the Life Sciences.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,740
A key finding of that report was
the hunger among MIT researchers

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,750
for more opportunities
to collaborate

57
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,400
across disciplinary boundaries.

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,570
The opportunities identified
and the recommendations

59
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,770
of the VITALS report were
embraced by President Kornbluth.

60
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,680
And with the prodigious
energy of our chief innovation

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,070
and strategy officer,
Dean Chandrakasan,

62
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,930
here we are today embarking
on a truly vital endeavor.

63
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,950
Upon hearing of the faculty's
interest in collaborating

64
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,140
with each other and with
our award-winning hospital

65
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,310
systems, the Kendall Square
biotech ecosystem, and beyond,

66
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,490
Phil set to work helping
us build those bridges.

67
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,990
A pivotal moment for me was a
gathering where a group of us

68
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,260
were brainstorming about what
this collaborative effort might

69
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,780
look like and what big
ideas would we lead with.

70
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,910
Lots of ideas were
being batted around.

71
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,660
At one point, Phil
challenged the group.

72
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,990
What do we do best
at MIT, he asked.

73
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,240
Everyone in the room must have
had their favorite answer,

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,890
but only Phil had an answer
so succinct and fundamental

75
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,220
and yet so universal
for us here at MIT.

76
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,920
We measure, he declared.

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,800
As a physicist, I can
admit I have never

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,170
directly peered into a
microscope and seen a cell.

79
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,530
But I do know measurement, and
that resonated tremendously.

80
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,990
Our obsession with
inquiry, with observation,

81
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,460
quantitative characterization,
experimentation, discovery,

82
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,550
and invention were all
wrapped into those words.

83
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,870
At MIT, we measure.

84
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,150
It's part of MIT's secret sauce
that Nancy Andrews alluded to

85
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,450
in the video you saw at the
beginning of our session.

86
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,090
It's what makes me so optimistic
about the unimagined discoveries

87
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,990
waiting to be made when we
bring seemingly disparate ideas

88
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,720
and tools together
through cross-disciplinary

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,850
collaborations.

90
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,750
This is the promise of the
MIT HEALS Collaborative.

91
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,140
And I'm very grateful to
Phil for his clarity, wisdom,

92
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,380
and encouragement as we
embark on this endeavor.

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,660
For those of you who
don't yet know Phil,

94
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,140
let me introduce him to you.

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,460
Dr. Phil Sharp is an
Institute professor

96
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,060
at MIT in the Koch Institute
for Integrative Cancer Research.

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,440
He is also the chair of the
advisory board for the MIT Abdul

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Jameel Clinic for Machine
Learning in Health, or J Clinic.

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,080
In 1993, he shared the Nobel
Prize in physiology of medicine

100
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,720
for the discovery
of split genes.

101
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,850
These are genes that--

102
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,790
the genes in DNA are not
one contiguous segment

103
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,780
of information as
they are in bacteria.

104
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,280
In fact, they are split.

105
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,000
And that messenger RNA
has to be processed

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,520
by splicing before it can be
translated into a protein.

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,390
This fundamental discovery
would alter the course

108
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,060
of how we understood genetic
disease and the development

109
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,630
of potential treatments.

110
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,560
In 2004, for this
work, he was awarded

111
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,430
the National Medal of Science.

112
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,440
You'll learn more about that
discovery from Phil shortly.

113
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,350
At MIT, he joined the Center
for Cancer Research in 1974,

114
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,470
serving as the director
from 1985 to 1991,

115
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,800
before becoming the head of
the Department of Biology

116
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
for eight years.

117
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,640
He was also the
founding director

118
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,740
of the McGovern Institute
for Brain Research

119
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,740
from 2000 to 2004.

120
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,020
Phil co-founded Biogen,
serving on its board for nearly

121
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,660
30 years, as well as Alnylam
Pharmaceuticals, a leader in RNA

122
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,100
interference-based therapies
with Professor Bartel

123
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,550
and Professor Emeritus Paul
Schimmel and MIT postdocs.

124
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,712
Phil is an elected member of the
National Academies of Sciences,

125
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:25,170
the National
Academies of Medicine,

126
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,740
the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, the American

127
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,170
Philosophical Society, and
the Royal Society of the UK.

128
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,130
His accolades, his advisory
board service, his awards,

129
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,200
and most importantly, his
500-plus research papers are too

130
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,970
numerous to recount in
the time that we have.

131
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,440
Even with our ample
measurement skills at MIT,

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,910
it would be truly hard to
measure his impact on biology

133
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,420
at MIT and beyond.

134
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,110
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Phil Sharp.

135
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,595
[APPLAUSE]

136
00:06:56,595 --> 00:07:12,940

137
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,670
Wow.

138
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,680
[LAUGHTER]

139
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,660
What a day.

140
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,980
What a way to start
a beautiful day.

141
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,300

142
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,910
I couldn't be more excited.

143
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:34,040
I couldn't be more enthusiastic
about MIT, MIT HEALS,

144
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,260
and what it's going to mean for
patients, people, the country,

145
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,205
Massachusetts, and MIT.

146
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:44,780

147
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,845
What I want to do in
the next few moments

148
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:54,050
is to give you a brief
overview of a journey

149
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,620
that I think tells you why this
initiative is so important.

150
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,790
I know I'm going to be
looking backwards and setting

151
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,310
the stage for what you're going
to hear today, looking forwards.

152
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,960
But I do think it
illustrates why we're here

153
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,740
and what we hope
continues to come out

154
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,660
of this great collaboration,
of which I am sure it will.

155
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,330
So I'm going to look
back over 50 years.

156
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,300
50 years is when the
Center for Cancer research

157
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,809
was established here at MIT.

158
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:38,270
I'm going to bring that
journey to where we're at now.

159
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,870
And I'm trying to emphasize what
changes, what major initiatives,

160
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,350
had this impact.

161
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,640
I have conflicts of interest.

162
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,850
Alnylam is the only one that I
will mention some relevant data

163
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,600
to.

164
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,580
Let's look back
at the late 1950s.

165
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,630
MIT's leadership looked at
the Department of Biology

166
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,910
and decided that in the
future, biology at MIT

167
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,560
will be gene-oriented, molecular
biology, driven mechanistically,

168
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,860
incorporating chemistry and
physics into this marvelous

169
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,000
discovery of the structure
of DNA by Watson and Crick

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,510
in Rosalind Franklin's data.

171
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:36,360
And that led to the recruitment
of Salvador Luria to MIT.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,440
Salva was a founder
of molecular biology,

173
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,000
the mentor of Jim Watson, and
came to MIT in the late 1950s

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,850
with other faculty and people
at MIT to create what is

175
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,740
the Department of Biology today.

176
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:07,890
In early 1970s, Salvador Luria
led a number of people at MIT

177
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:13,320
to apply for a basic cancer
research center here.

178
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,820
This is after the National
Cancer Institute Act

179
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,490
in Congress.

180
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,200
Leading that initiative was
Luria and Dave Baltimore

181
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,120
in molecular cell
biology and virology,

182
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,580
Herman Eisen in immunology, and
Phil Robins in cell biology.

183
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,690
Here in the early '70s,
the pillars of much of what

184
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,850
we're talking about in health
care, molecular immunology,

185
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,580
cell biology, was established
here as a basic cancer center.

186
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,400
And remarkably, the culture
of this cancer center

187
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,260
is a culture of MIT.

188
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,780
It's a culture of
collaborative interaction,

189
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,480
of people sharing ideas,
sharing initiatives.

190
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,290
What is shown here on
the slide is the group

191
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,730
of molecular cancer biologists
in the Cancer Center with Dave

192
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,290
Baltimore peeking
down at the left,

193
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,750
Bob Weinberg over his shoulder.

194
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm up on the right side.

195
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,200
But this was a collaborative
group of sharing ideas--

196
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,010
an MIT mode of science.

197
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,060
And it had an enormous effect.

198
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,210
Dave Baltimore received a
Nobel Prize in 1975, one year

199
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,600
after the establishment
of the Cancer Center.

200
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,290
And then Susumu Tonegawa, who
was recruited to the Cancer

201
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:46,920
Center--

202
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,400
shortly thereafter
another Nobel Prize.

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,220
After that-- and
then Bob Horowitz

204
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,730
at MIT, who was in the
Department of Biology

205
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,960
and a member of the
cancer center, also

206
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,920
received a Nobel Prize in the
period of the Cancer Center

207
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,290
in its site in the chocolate
factory on Ames Street.

208
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,990
I want to illustrate why this
initiative of the Cancer Center

209
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,440
was so timely.

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Here in the early 1970s,
there was the beginning

211
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,310
of the understanding that
the pillars of biology--

212
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,990
which was the central
dogma illustrated here--

213
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,010
as DNA information flowing
to RNA flowing to protein,

214
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:42,490
had just been established
by Jacoby Meno in 1961.

215
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,250
And what you see here
is a simple diagram--

216
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,780
that the RNA is being copied
from the DNA in a colinear way

217
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,060
and proteins translated from it.

218
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,740
And there is a sugar that is
metabolized by these proteins

219
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,030
and that sugar regulates
the expression of this gene.

220
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,770
This is how we understood
molecular biology in the early

221
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,610
1970s.

222
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,050
But we thought that the world
was more complex than that.

223
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,720
When we started talking about
multicellular organisms--

224
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,660
was the gene and how it
was expressed the same

225
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,680
in multicellular organisms?

226
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,110
And there were hints-- and
I won't go through those--

227
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,310
that there was
something different.

228
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,350
And that, for example, led to
the understanding and discovery

229
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,210
that genes in our systems
have different structures.

230
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,490
They are split.

231
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,440
And they are expressed
by an intermediate step

232
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,560
of the splicing of the RNA,
removing the dashed lines shown

233
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,620
at the top of the slide,
and joining the black boxes.

234
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,660
The black box is the sequences
that code for the protein.

235
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,430
So here, the complexity of
the genome and complexity

236
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,130
of how it's expressed
and how it's regulated

237
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,380
was much more complex
than it was in bacteria.

238
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,960
And it led us to
understand that we

239
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:21,020
were in a new territory of
understanding disease processes.

240
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,100
I also want to note, the
splicing pattern on those genes

241
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,230
vary from cell to cell and
condition to condition.

242
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,040
And therefore, even though
we have 23,000 genes,

243
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,260
we have many more proteins.

244
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,670
They vary between cells
from those proteins

245
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,340
by alternative splicing and they
carry out different functions.

246
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,580
And we're just in the
last several years

247
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,580
able now to look at a
single cell and say,

248
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:52,520
this is exactly what the gene
is expressed at in those cells.

249
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,310
But also in the
same time period,

250
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:01,680
in 1975, we had this
convergence or confluence

251
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,700
of remarkable discoveries that
created synthetic biology--

252
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,890
the ability to make organisms
that had never existed before.

253
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,310
And that was this
recombinant DNA technology--

254
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,430
DNA sequencing and
chemical synthesis.

255
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,630
So we could take DNA and
we could make new genes

256
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,170
and we can put
genes in organisms.

257
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,470
This technology was
recognized to be

258
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,150
a transformational technology.

259
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,680
And the first biotech
community or company

260
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,210
that was established
in 1976, Genentech,

261
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,090
was by Bob Swanson
and Herb Boyer.

262
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,240
Swanson, an MIT graduate--

263
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,670
Boyer, as a scientist
at San Francisco--

264
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,470
led to this
foundation of biotech

265
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,240
and the whole biotech industry.

266
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,660
And I had the pleasure of
collaborating with Wally Gilbert

267
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,290
at Harvard and six
European scientists

268
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,020
in establishing Biogen in 1978.

269
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,590
The idea here is, this
technology had been

270
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,510
developed in academic labs.

271
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,880
And it wasn't going
to benefit anyone

272
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,970
until it was translated
into the private sector,

273
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,810
gained capital and
investment, recruit people,

274
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,540
and make a difference
in people's life.

275
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,910
Be innovative in
this technology.

276
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,480
And that led to
Biogen first being

277
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
established in Geneva in 1978.

278
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,680
When the situation became a
little clearer in Cambridge

279
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,520
as to what you could do with
recombinant DNA In the early

280
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,960
'80s, this moved to Cambridge.

281
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:51,120
And what I show you here is what
Cambridge looked like in 1975.

282
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,270
What you see to
the right of that

283
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,730
is Main Street and
MIT across the street.

284
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,940
But you see a large parking lot.

285
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:07,550
A parking lot, for
historical reasons, was open.

286
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,400
And Biogen began in a little
building on Binney Street

287
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,190
on the left side of that slide.

288
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,260
So here, Cambridge was the site
in which this new technology

289
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,839
was beginning to nucleate.

290
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,369
Genzyme and other companies
established in the same area

291
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,890
shortly after or
at the same time.

292
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,000
But then it grew
and it consolidated

293
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,660
and it collaborated.

294
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,460
And that became the Kendall
Square area in 2012,

295
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,150
where that same
space is now occupied

296
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,410
by companies that are
making marvelous advances

297
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,100
in important ways.

298
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,920
And as Sally said,
it happened because

299
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,800
of the great universities,
the hospitals

300
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,980
across the street with
remarkable faculty

301
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,580
and clinicians, and the New
England finance and venture

302
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,190
capital acceptance.

303
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,850
This continued to grow.

304
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,550
We're the most concentrated
biotech community in the world.

305
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,860
Life science-- it's
a remarkably dynamic,

306
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,590
collaborative, networking
community that is reflecting

307
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,850
a very important part.

308
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,200
And I forgot to mention,
it wouldn't have happened

309
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,950
if it wasn't for MIT engineers.

310
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,420
MIT engineers allowed us
to take these products

311
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,870
and make new components of it.

312
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,660
So all of this happened.

313
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,840
And now we see what
Cambridge is like.

314
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,910
I should illustrate
here in 2018 that

315
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,170
large pharmaceutical companies,
research stations, research

316
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,140
institutes, have moved
into the community.

317
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,610
And there's probably
50 or more small to

318
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,160
medium-sized biotech companies.

319
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,750
Biogen has grown.

320
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,390
And Alnylam, which I'm going
to talk about in a moment,

321
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,850
and then Broad--

322
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm going to talk
about immediately--

323
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,580
as additions to
this community that

324
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,700
empowered a lot of
remarkable advances.

325
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,480
So we move to 2000, the
turn of the century.

326
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,120
And biotech took on
another acceleration

327
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,610
in the country because of the
development of the human genome

328
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,700
initiative and the
human genome sequence.

329
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,450
And it's interesting to think
about the origins of that work.

330
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:50,690
Whitehead was
established in 1985.

331
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,330
It was a new institute
relationship to MIT.

332
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,000
MIT was open to bringing new
resources and new structures

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,470
to being part of
the community at MIT

334
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,040
at the Whitehead Institute.

335
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,650
Excuse me.

336
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,180
Dave Baltimore recruited
Eric Lander, who

337
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,590
started the genome initiative.

338
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,930
And that genome initiative then
moved with additional resources

339
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,780
to the Broad Institute, which
is across the street from MIT--

340
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,080
associated with MIT and Harvard.

341
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,880
Again, a collaboration.

342
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,940
And that led in 2003, with an
international initiative highly

343
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,270
influenced and led by
the Broad Institute,

344
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,100
to the whole human
genome sequence.

345
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,380
This was a accelerator because
then we had in our hand

346
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,130
the sequence of every gene--

347
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,810
the sequence of the genome.

348
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,130
And we could begin to
integrate complex genetics

349
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,350
and molecular tools into
this identification of--

350
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,850
this powerful technology
of recombinant DNA.

351
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,140
This allowed us to more
rapidly translate our science

352
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,230
and our technology
into patients.

353
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,270
And just to illustrate
how that happened

354
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,950
or the consequence of that,
I will speak about a subject

355
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,610
that appeared in 2000, and that
is with the genome sequence.

356
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,450
In previous science,
it was recognized

357
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,010
that our cells encode another
500 or more genes that we

358
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,500
didn't know about, that
encoded small RNAs.

359
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,710
These small RNAs were
called microRNAs.

360
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,560
The initial discovery
of the first

361
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,610
was in 1993 out of Gary Ruvkun
and Victor Ambros' [INAUDIBLE]

362
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,700
network.

363
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,020
It was done initially
with collaboration

364
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,890
in Bob [INAUDIBLE] lab.

365
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,870
And out of that came this
discovery of microRNAs.

366
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,300
And as you will note, that was
recognized by a Nobel Prize

367
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,810
in this year, 2024.

368
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,780
This microRNA pathway is
present in every cell.

369
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:14,200
It was totally unrecognized
until the 2000s by David Bartel

370
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,080
and others.

371
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,950
And it has become a major
regulatory-- involved in cancer,

372
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,100
involved in many processes.

373
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,830
And then at the
same time, in 1998,

374
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,140
there was a discovery by Fire
and Mello of the fact that

375
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,610
double-strand RNA--

376
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,960
most RNA is single
stranded in the cell.

377
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,050
But you can see double strand.

378
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,780
And double-strand
RNA from a gene

379
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,020
will silence the expression of
that gene in many organisms.

380
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,840
Their work was done in
the worm C. elegans,

381
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,910
but it was soon recognized
that that work interdigitated

382
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,900
with the microRNA work.

383
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,350
And this led us to
an understanding

384
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,870
that there was another
biochemical system

385
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,740
in the cell we didn't know.

386
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,540
Andy Fire was a grad
student here at MIT,

387
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,020
but did the work
after he left MIT.

388
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,610
Using that work, and with
David Bartel and Phil Zamore

389
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,480
and Tom Tuschl, postdocs, and
Paul Schimmel's influence,

390
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,850
it became recognized
that this whole process

391
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,030
of silencing a gene
with RNA offered

392
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,140
a new therapeutic modality.

393
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,610
We could use the natural pathway
in the cell, design a drug--

394
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,150
siRNA-- from the
sequence, and then

395
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,920
treat a patient if the
modulation of that gene

396
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,660
would have an impact.

397
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,720
So that was just another way of
possibly benefiting patients.

398
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,310
And that led to then the
establishment of Alnylam,

399
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,480
and the confrontation
that the big problem here

400
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,270
was delivery of the RNA.

401
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:05,680
We turned to engineers and other
chemists to solve that problem.

402
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,550
Delivery of RNA into
cells is difficult

403
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,430
because RNA is hydrophilic
and your cell has

404
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,500
a membrane that's hydrophobic.

405
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,430
And therefore you have to
transport the RNA into the cell.

406
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:24,390
But once it's in the cell, it
will enter the microRNA pathway

407
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,870
and carry out-- if it's
complementary to the messenger

408
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,780
RNA--

409
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:34,360
destruction of the messenger
RNA and then be catalytic.

410
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,870
So the big issue
here was, could you

411
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,750
introduce this RNA into cells?

412
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,830
And that led to the development
of lipid nanoparticles, which

413
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,530
look like a virus.

414
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,330
They have a cationic
lipid of a certain type.

415
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,200
Pieter Cullis taught us--

416
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,300
that is a Canadian scientist
who made major contributions

417
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,990
to this.

418
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,350
Impacting the RNA into
these nanoparticles

419
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:08,590
would, with the right ionic
pH and PK, give you then

420
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,870
a change in conformation
of those lipids

421
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,130
as the particle enters the cell.

422
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,090
In your blood system,
you have a pH of seven.

423
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,050
In the cell, it's nearly a
pH of 5 in this endosome.

424
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,020
And that creates
this transition.

425
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,700
That same technology--
similar technology

426
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,430
was used in the
vaccination in COVID that

427
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,710
rescued us from the pandemic.

428
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,180
It has then been used to
treat billions of patients.

429
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,010
Here again, you see
the collaborations

430
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,950
between molecular
discovery, to innovation,

431
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,610
to the translation
to benefit patients.

432
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:55,130
And then other people using
those insights to further solve

433
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,500
a major societal
problem in the pandemic.

434
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,770
So that brings me
to looking forward

435
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,490
at what you're going to hear
in the next several hours

436
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,180
from my remarkable
colleagues here at MIT.

437
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,110
And that's what we've
called convergence.

438
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,730
With the discoveries of the
structures of sequences of DNA

439
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,810
and the genome pathways
and the cell mechanisms

440
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,740
by which the cell carries out
communications between cells,

441
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,610
we have the makings--

442
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,270
not a complete understanding,
but the makings--

443
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,100
of how the cell works
and the components.

444
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,270
And if we look back over time,
that's a product of research

445
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,830
from the mid '50s--

446
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,200
as recruitment of Luria--

447
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,930
the establishment
of the institutes,

448
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,720
research advances,
discoveries of multiple types.

449
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,880
And then we are at a
stage in which engineering

450
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,390
can take those components
and add to our tools

451
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,590
and understanding
these processes.

452
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:11,490
Adding AI can change how we
can empower our scientists

453
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,650
to benefit patients
to solve problems.

454
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,980
And that's what we've
called convergence.

455
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:25,600
And it's what MIT HEALS is
a major component in making,

456
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,810
and it is the future
of life science.

457
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:35,280
And it's a future of benefiting
a large number of patients.

458
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,750
The Koch Institute is one
of the examples that have

459
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,260
been established around it.

460
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,980
You will hear more
today about the Koch

461
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,790
Institute and its technology.

462
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,870
But its faculty
are a combination

463
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:56,220
on every floor of engineers,
life scientists, chemists,

464
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,450
and physicists.

465
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,740
We are a very interdisciplinary,
integrated institute.

466
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,460
But if you look at the McGovern
Institute in Brain Research--

467
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,890
the Picower in brain research,
the Reagan Institute,

468
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,470
you see this integration
of technology

469
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,100
and molecular cell
and cell biology,

470
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,840
and the whole premise of
looking outward and impacting

471
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,020
on patients.

472
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,670
And it is a remarkable,
remarkable--

473
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,410
and I should include
the Reagan Institute--

474
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:37,720
a remarkable set of institutes
associated with MIT.

475
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,630
No other institute
that I know of

476
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,700
has been able to create this
body of collaborative institutes

477
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,430
in a community with such a
powerful biotech community

478
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:56,210
and hospitals that is looking
forward, as our governor said,

479
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,060
in making MIT--

480
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,420
Massachusetts-- keeping it an
absolute leader in this space.

481
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,350
So innovation continues.

482
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,970
Here is just the number of
companies over the last--

483
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,250
from 2007 to now.

484
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,050
That faculty in the Koch has
continued to use technology--

485
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,000
to make discoveries
in technology

486
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,990
and translate to patients.

487
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,000
And that is the continued
engagement with society,

488
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,610
changing the outcome
of our patients

489
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,210
in our country with
this technology.

490
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,740
So I am really grateful to have
this chance to speak with you.

491
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,450
Everything I've
talked about is a, we.

492
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:49,320
Everything has been done by
collaboration with many people--

493
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,800
with faculty, with our
students, our postdocs.

494
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,990
I show you here
reunions of my lab

495
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,160
over the last 30 or so years.

496
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,970
All of MIT and all
of my colleagues

497
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,540
have contributed to
making this moment.

498
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:15,080
And I am terribly excited
about what MIT HEALS means

499
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,720
for MIT and for the country.

500
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,060
Thank you.

501
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,110
[APPLAUSE]

502
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:33,000
