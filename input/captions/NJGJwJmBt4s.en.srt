Hi, my name is Ava. I'm a junior at MIT

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,120
and my project along with my supervisor

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,360
Robert is called Climate Change Happens

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,679
Below Water and it's all about using

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
sensors to collect data about the waters

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,199
around us. Water has a memory. It

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,439
remembers some of the harms that come to

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,400
it. One way that you can show how carbon

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,199
dioxide affects regular water is to get

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,199
a simple straw. It becomes more acidic

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
because it's creating carbonic acid. The

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,359
plant life is counteracting that effect.

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,360
There actually are global changes that

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
are impacting the level of compounds

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,040
dissolving into the water around us.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,840
When it's snowy out, a lot of people

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
like to put salt down on the roads.

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,440
Fertilizer and pesticides, all of these

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,040
things have to go somewhere and they can

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,039
also end up running off into the water

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,200
source, which again can impact the

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
quality of the water and can be measured

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,399
by the total dissolved solids

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,600
measurement kit that we have for

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,079
students to use. For more MIT moments
