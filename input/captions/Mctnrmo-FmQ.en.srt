1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,960
So good morning um and um welcome to

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,160
this first day of our RD conference. I'm

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,119
Gatri Shiniasan, executive director of

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,119
MIT corporate relations.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,560
So at MIT we define innovation as a

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,080
process of taking an India for taking an

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,280
idea uh taking an idea to impact right

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,760
so that's how we define uh innovation we

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
are not just about conducting research

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
we are solving the world's most pressing

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,480
challenges across every discipline

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,320
imaginable from material science to

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,960
economics from energy to healthcare MIT

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
consistently transforms breakthrough

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,360
ideas into real world solutions that

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,280
reshape industries and improve their um

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,440
improve lives.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Here we have in this example

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,840
nanoarchchitected

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,479
carbon that can uh withstand supersonic

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,240
impacts. So that's literally um

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,840
materials that can face in the uh face

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
in the sorry laugh in the face of

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,920
physics. Um we are solving and working

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
with um uh commercializing plasma fusion

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,640
and clean energy because why not solve

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,119
energy crisis while we are at it right

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,520
um and also you have an example of paper

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,920
thin solar cells with very thin margins

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,720
now we also have profess professor Bob

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,000
Langanger who is pretty much um a

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,560
walking patent factory um we have uh

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,840
professor Mongji Bendi who won the Nobel

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,640
price for quantum um dots, which by the

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,040
way exists in all your TVs and makes

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,680
your Netflix Netflix binging experience

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,360
good or much better than what it used to

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,240
be. Oh, and we have sent a few uh people

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,119
to space because I think they found

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,840
Earth was not challenging enough. So,

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,720
there's that. And last year, we had um

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Darren Aimoglue as well as Simon Johnson

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,000
who won the Nobel Prize in economics.

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,640
And so yeah, we are covering everything

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,720
from atoms to astronauts to economic

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,200
systems.

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,959
So um here are some examples of

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,959
companies that were formed by MIT folks.

49
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,200
And when I few when I say a few

50
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,040
companies, here they are. And I'm not

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,840
even listing Campbell Soup. Um so yeah,

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
we have MIT DNA in your chicken noodle

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,640
soup. So when you have it, think about

54
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,920
that. So the point is that MITers don't

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,920
just form companies, we start

56
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,920
industries.

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,560
And I just want to throw some numbers at

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,120
you while uh you stare at the screen. Um

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,200
we have 105 Nobel laureates. That's not

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,519
a typo. That is 105 Nobel laureates. We

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,599
have 84 MacArthur Fellows. That's the

62
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,319
gener Genius Awards that you may have

63
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,800
heard of. We have 64 National Medal of

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
Science. And then of course what would

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,319
matter to you as industry partners is

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,720
that we have 700 companies working with

67
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,760
MIT faculty and students on research

68
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,000
opportunities. We have 593 invention

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,879
disclosures last year. That's pretty

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,560
much one and a half groundbreaking

71
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:34,959
inventions every single day including

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,840
weekends. And 362 US patents issued last

73
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,319
year. That means one patent every day

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,080
and maybe 2 days of vacation. That's it,

75
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,280
right? And the largest number here is

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,959
our alumni have founded over 30,000

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,879
companies since we started our we we uh

78
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:58,319
existed as MIT. That's about 400 4.6

79
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,840
million people employed, 1.9 trillion in

80
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,560
revenue. So basically our MIT grads have

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,640
accidentally created an economy. That's

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,959
the size of Italy. And get this, 40% of

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,360
those alumni are serial entrepreneurs.

84
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,759
Uh, which is a fancy way of saying that

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,600
they couldn't stop just creating one

86
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
world changing company because

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
overachievement basically runs in every

88
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,680
MIT grad here.

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,080
Now, you may be wondering, what is MIT

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,919
up to right now, right? What is MIT

91
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,680
focusing on? And that's a great

92
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,919
question. And let me walk you through

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
some of President uh Conbble's

94
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,560
priorities because this is where we are

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,040
doubling down and we are trying to solve

96
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,840
and make impact climate. We are

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,160
marshalling our uh expertise to lead

98
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,040
technological behavioral and policy

99
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,440
solutions because someone has to and we

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
have the kinds of expertise experts and

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,759
scientists to do it.

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,840
Second, we have health, health and life

103
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,720
sciences bringing together world-class

104
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,880
expertise to catalyze discovery

105
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,000
innovation for human health. Remember

106
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,080
Mona that also came from MIT, right?

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,639
Human insight

108
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
elevating human- centered research. Yes,

109
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,080
when you think about MIT, you think

110
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,720
about all the engineers. Yes, we are

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,639
engineers. But we also remember that

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,520
humans are the ones that are using all

113
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,360
this technology. artificial intelligence

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,400
providing leadership as society

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,560
navigates AI implications. We are

116
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,360
literally the people who helped invent

117
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,600
the field. So we figure we should help

118
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,039
figure out how to use and what to do

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,680
with AI. Education designing curricula

120
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,000
for the digital and AI age.

121
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
manufacturing defining the future of

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,520
manufacturing with higher productivity,

123
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
higher wages, lower carbon footprint,

124
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,720
better jobs, and greater resilience.

125
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,840
Basically, making things that matter

126
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
better. Quantum amplifying quantum

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,800
research and driving innovation to

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,520
unlock capabilities that redefine what's

129
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,280
computationally possible. Guess regular

130
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,000
computing was getting boring. Um, now

131
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,560
you may wonder what is special here?

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
What uh is it the water? Is it the

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,880
weather? I can tell you it's definitely

134
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,360
not the water or the weather. Absolutely

135
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,080
not. Uh, our secret sauce is not really

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,800
that secret. We tackle problems that

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,600
change the world first. We identify the

138
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,560
challenges that matter most and marshall

139
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,160
resources to solve them. We always put

140
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,120
impact before everything else. Second,

141
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,680
we encourage risk-taking. In fact, we

142
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
actually expect failures on the way to

143
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,560
success. We don't just tolerate

144
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,000
failures. We celebrate it on the as a

145
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,039
learning opportunity. And celebrating

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,919
failures, try that as an as a cor in the

147
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,720
corporate environment. And third, we

148
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,800
have a well staffed office

149
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,639
that is MIT corporate relations and we

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,280
are always tasked towards putting

151
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
industry in the room uh exploring

152
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
opportunities to connect. We are

153
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,720
literally here to make connections

154
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,960
happen. And fourth, all key ecosystem

155
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,360
leaders are within walking distance.

156
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,319
Entrepreneurs, government, corporate,

157
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,560
risk capital and MIT researchers all in

158
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,199
the same neighborhood. You can't have a

159
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,039
serendipitous coffee meeting while being

160
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,680
in different uh time zones. And um so

161
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,919
it's not just about MIT being great in

162
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,880
isolation. It's about MIT being the

163
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,919
catalyst that brings everyone together.

164
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:46,080
And we are like the yeast in the bread

165
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,759
of innovation. Now that's a very um uh

166
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,759
weird metaphor, but I'm a

167
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,759
microbiologist. It works for me. Um

168
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,479
so let me uh tell you about the two

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,360
integrated programs within MIT corporate

170
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,479
relations that are your tickets into

171
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,039
this ecosystem. The MI MIT industrial

172
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,840
leazison program. This is industry's

173
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,560
most comprehensive portal to MIT. We've

174
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,479
got over 200 member companies who use

175
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
this as their front door to everything

176
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,599
MIT has to offer.

177
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,400
Then we have MIT startup exchange

178
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,960
through which we promote and pro promote

179
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,479
collaboration between MIT connected

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,440
startups and industry. We've got over

181
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,800
800 technology- based startups in that

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,440
system and or in that network and each

183
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,240
one is a potential gamecher in in its

184
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,599
field. Now that's a lot of disruption

185
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,839
waiting to happen.

186
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,279
Now you may wonder how do we go about

187
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,240
doing this right we have this rise

188
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,560
framework and what what that means is

189
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,120
you get the opportunity to connect with

190
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,640
MIT around research opportunities

191
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,399
innovation students and education you

192
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,560
can do this through our webinars

193
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,399
in-person events across the globe

194
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,360
meeting with faculty and learning

195
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,160
journeys with researchers and experts in

196
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,600
the field meet with networks of students

197
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,480
s 800 plus startups and also your peer

198
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,040
members across the globe. You can also

199
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,600
upskill, reskill and new skill your

200
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,880
employees via professional education,

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,880
execed and open learning.

202
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
We drive impact across every industry.

203
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,680
So 200 plus members where are they? They

204
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,600
are all in these different industries.

205
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
And I don't want to talk about the

206
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,240
different industries. You can see it.

207
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,320
This is all you all that participate

208
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,880
through this network.

209
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,640
Now, where are these companies located?

210
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,279
It's a global um it's not bos it's not a

211
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,560
Boston thing. Yes, many of you are here,

212
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,560
but the companies are all global. And we

213
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,880
have regional network across every

214
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,680
continent and pretty much every country

215
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,240
except a few. And because innovation

216
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,440
transcends geographic boundaries and so

217
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,760
does MIT's re reach,

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,600
I wanted to showcase a couple uh

219
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,760
research success stories um through ILP

220
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,560
Lonza which is one of the world's

221
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,800
largest pharmaceutical CDMOs connected

222
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,360
with MIT faculty and are collaborating

223
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,760
around micrfluidic platform that

224
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,040
analyzes single cell properties in real

225
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
time. This is helping them um monitor

226
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,519
production quality enabling faster

227
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,959
process adjustments and consistent

228
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,360
manufacturing. Another example is our M

229
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,240
mineral stewardship consortium where

230
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,720
four global mining leaders came together

231
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,120
through the ILP to s uh to tackle

232
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,600
sustainable mining challenges.

233
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,480
collaborating with MIT faculty. They are

234
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,040
developing the digital tools for mine uh

235
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,880
decision making and ESG metrics that

236
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,279
will transform entire the entire

237
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,519
industry. These are the kinds of

238
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,640
breakthroughs that happen when you bring

239
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,959
together brilliant minds, tough problems

240
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,399
and partners willing to invest in the

241
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,959
future. Here are a few

242
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,440
success stories that involve startups

243
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,279
and startups connecting with our uh 200

244
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
plus members. I'm not going to walk

245
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,880
through all of them. You'll have an

246
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,760
opportunity to hear from a few of the

247
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,760
startups uh today.

248
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,839
And lastly, before I thank you, I did

249
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,560
want to uh leave with the bottom line.

250
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,920
MIT is not just about producing great

251
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,720
research. We do do that. It's not just

252
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,720
about creating startups. We do that too.

253
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,680
It's about building the ecosystem where

254
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,560
problems get solved, where failure leads

255
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,360
to learning, where industry and academia

256
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,839
actually work together. Um, not instead

257
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,920
of just talking about it, and where the

258
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,640
next big breakthrough is probably

259
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,639
happening right now in a lab that you've

260
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,240
never heard of. To the ILP member member

261
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,440
companies, I'm glad we are working

262
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,480
together.

263
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,519
And to the ILP curious, we'd love for

264
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,560
you to start working with us. Please um

265
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,040
work uh we you'll see see my colleagues

266
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,959
here, Eileena uh and others. Can you

267
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,480
please stand up? Uh other program

268
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,279
directors from the industry leazison

269
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,440
program and startup exchange.

270
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,000
So please you can meet with them with

271
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,000
that. Thank you.

272
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,920
Thank you, Geth. Uh, welcome everyone.

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
Good morning. Uh, my name is Arena

274
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,880
Sigalowski. I'm director at the MIT

275
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,560
Office of Corporate Relations. It's my

276
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,040
pleasure to host you here today. Um, why

277
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,680
are you here today? So, I personally

278
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,040
think that there is a lot of noise uh in

279
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,360
the world. uh a lot of hype about

280
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,959
technologies, about job politics, about

281
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,560
resources, about economic shifts uh and

282
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,959
a lot of uncertainty. So hopefully today

283
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,000
uh nobody pretends to have a crystal

284
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,240
ball uh but we do have a lot of great

285
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,120
minds here on campus and a lot of

286
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,959
top-notch experts. And so I hope you

287
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,680
will leave this conference uh with very

288
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,399
useful insights about how to understand

289
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,560
the world today and also how to prepare

290
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,040
for the world tomorrow. So before we

291
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,360
begin the conference I want to just make

292
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
few logistical notes. Uh first of all

293
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,320
