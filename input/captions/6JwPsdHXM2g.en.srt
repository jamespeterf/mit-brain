1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,292
There's something really interesting when

2
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,377
you walk into a classroom.

3
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,045
You hear so many different accents.

4
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:04,921
You hear students

5
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,756
from all over the world.

6
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,633
You meet faculty from all over the world.

7
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,551
It's very rare at MIT

8
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,677
to walk into a meeting

9
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,220
and be the only person who's a

10
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,263
foreign-born individual.

11
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:14,973
And you see people who

12
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,558
are drawn to MIT as a place

13
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,475
as much as they're drawn to

14
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,560
being in the United States.

15
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,061
They're drawn to the idea of MIT.

16
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:27,110
[MUSIC PLAYING]

17
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,365
MIT is a very special place.

18
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,867
And the more time is spent

19
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,076
here, the more you see it,

20
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,327
because there are so many

21
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,413
brilliant people around you.

22
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,416
We are a community, that is

23
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,126
diverse on who we are.

24
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,878
And that forces our

25
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,129
ideas to become better.

26
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,047
You walk around the Infinite

27
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,507
Corridor, and suddenly you

28
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,633
see a person who wrote a

29
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,885
textbook or the person who

30
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,136
won the Nobel Prize.

31
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,304
And suddenly it's not

32
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,764
any person in the field.

33
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,557
It's the person in the field.

34
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,184
We're all rational,

35
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,852
compassionate human beings first.

36
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,312
And then, oh, and by the

37
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,021
way, I come from Beirut.

38
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,898
By the way, I come from Macedonia.

39
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:05,607
By the way, I come--

40
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,526
it's something that we

41
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,987
take to be for granted,

42
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,655
that we come from somewhere, and we have

43
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,948
a unique story to tell.

44
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,242
A place like MIT is where

45
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,702
you could also do research

46
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,788
that you care about.

47
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,205
You can do the

48
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,289
science that you care about.

49
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,248
I've always been

50
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,084
fascinated by what's the problem

51
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,211
I'm solving what

52
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,378
difference does it make.

53
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,714
There was this draw to MIT,

54
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,758
because it was this mecca,

55
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,426
really, this place where

56
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,136
all of this amazing research

57
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,346
was happening.

58
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,349
My passion has been about understanding

59
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,851
long-run economic growth,

60
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,144
what makes some countries rich,

61
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,145
some countries poor.

62
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,480
I decided to work on machine

63
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,440
learning for small molecules.

64
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,109
It was really a new area.

65
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,404
What is this transition between an atom

66
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,823
and a bulk material?

67
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,950
How do authoritarian regimes and

68
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,201
dictatorships come about?

69
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,703
What explains regime durability?

70
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,791
So for me, the scientist is not a job.

71
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,460
There was a thing I

72
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,378
thought, oh, that would

73
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,712
be super cool to be.

74
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,216
I decided that I would work

75
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,802
on helping people get smarter.

76
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,096
What I do, I don't see it as a job.

77
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,556
I see it as a calling.

78
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,850
And so when I get up every

79
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,768
day, solving this problem

80
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,854
is what is always in my mind.

81
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,646
I get to think about

82
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,690
these lofty questions of where

83
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,691
do we come from and

84
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,567
what's out in the universe.

85
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,568
But then I get to go

86
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,652
in a lab and just build,

87
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,821
Just plain old build things, design things.

88
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,116
And so it's the best job in the world.
