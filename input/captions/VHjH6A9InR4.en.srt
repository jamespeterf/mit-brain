00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,920
hello everybody and welcome to our last

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,080
video at least for a while on music

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,400
representation and I want to talk about

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,160
a remarkable tool created by a

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,400
researcher at Stanford Craig Stuart Sapp

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,800
that he calls the Rosetta

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,599
Stone I'm going to be skipping a few

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,880
slides from his presentation and if

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,960
added a few other things but in this

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
module I will also present his entirety

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,480
of

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:45,480
slides that he has given and my hats off

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:49,559
to Craig sap for all he's done and his

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,920
generosity so the Rosetta Stone was a

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,440
stone discovered in I think 1799 and

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,840
deciphered over the next uh I 10 years

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,119
or so that was a remarkable

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,320
um Discovery because up until that point

19
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:10,600
Egyptian hieroglyphics such as those

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,720
highlighted here were not legible by

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:19,640
anybody living at that point but the

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:22,759
Rosetta Stone had two forms of Egyptian

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,040
hieroglyphics and also in the top two

24
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:29,960
sections and also at the bottom the

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,880
exact same text in Greek and so since

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,159
people knew how to read ancient Greek

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,079
they were able to go through each of the

28
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,040
signs of ancient Greek and figure out

29
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,200
what the signs of the hieroglyphics and

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,960
the two forms of writing

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,200
meant Craig saps Rosetta Stone allows us

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,880
to look at how different digital

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,520
representations of Music work by

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,880
encoding the exact same melody in I

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,840
think almost two dozen different formats

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640
these aren't all formats that have ever

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,240
been used but it's a good chunk of them

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,759
so here's the melody and it has um some

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,440
interesting things here it has different

40
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,920
octaves it has uh key signature time

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,879
signature has beaming information the

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,360
only thing it really well some of the

43
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,440
things it doesn't have Are chords and

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,720
triplets and things like that but once

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,840
you see how this melody is encoded in a

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,160
lot of formats you can figure out how

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
all the other things might be encoded in

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,239
those formats

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,760
so here's an example of a code that's uh

50
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,120
not used as much today but was once very

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,720
important uh plain and easy code and you

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,120
can see that we have something like I

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,400
can decipher okay maybe that's a g on

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,120
clef on line two and then we have a flat

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:56,480
on the on b 2 four and then we have an

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:03:00,560
eighth note with a DOT on c um and then

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,599
uh I I guess the three means 302 note

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,159
DC and there's a little bracket around

59
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,519
it and that probably means they're beam

60
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,239
together then we have two eighth notes

61
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,319
on C beam together have slash means new

62
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:18,000
measure and so on throughout the whole

63
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,959
thing we can see um that oh maybe octave

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,879
isn't encoded here or um something like

65
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,239
that and um we can figure out how those

66
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,439
go here is another format this is uh

67
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,040
primarily used for folk songs called ABC

68
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:37,560
and we can see that um well example

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,599
maybe that's the title of the piece 24 K

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,560
is key is f l means the smallest

71
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,439
possible encoding is a 16th note then we

72
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,079
see that c is worth three of those 16th

73
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,400
D is worth I guess 1 half C is 1/2 C is

74
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,519
worth two of those that's eth note C is

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,599
worth two of those we have a bar line

76
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,239
and so on and we can see that the high C

77
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,000
is encoded with c with a um apostrophe

78
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,439
after

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,920
it this is what's called dar's code it

80
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,640
was once highly used but it hasn't

81
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,560
really been used very much recently

82
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,799
and well I don't know how to read dar's

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,400
code but uh I think that the numbers

84
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,600
represent pitch here we have an eth with

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,960
a DOT and t means 302 I'm guessing and

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,840
so on we have some rs's which might mean

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,960
16th note this is Guido music notation

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,479
which uses uh backslashes to indicate

89
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,000
certain kinds of musical elements we can

90
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,960
see CS Keys meters are encoded in here

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,199
uh bar lines are explicitly encoded it

92
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:54,479
looks like you put a slash before a a

93
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,160
beat a duration and there's some dur

94
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,759
notes that don't have durations but they

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,440
seem to be the same duration as before

96
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,680
and so on

97
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,280
I think it looks like underscores our

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,960
rest this is Muse data which Michael

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,039
good said was one of the um inspiration

100
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,600
behind music XML it's a little bit

101
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:18,360
bigger format takes more space uh it was

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,840
one of what we used to use a lot these

103
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,120
fixed position encodings so that if

104
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,560
you're writing in a monus baced font

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,319
every single place uh has a particular

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,000
meaning so you can look at column 8 or

107
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:36,360
something like that and see the duration

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and then this was a a major positive

109
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,960
step because it encodes duration in

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,560
terms of the number of uh something the

111
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,960
number of 30 second notes and also

112
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,400
separately the the look of the duration

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,319
and so you can still see that in music

114
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,880
XML and formats that are still in use

115
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,639
today I really like the use of these uh

116
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,160
left and right square brackets to

117
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
indicate the start and an end of

118
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,080
beams humdrum is a code that we have

119
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,319
encountered a couple times and here it

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,360
is and maybe it's easier with humdrum to

121
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,880
rotate the musical examples so we can

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,319
see how things go maybe maybe not but we

123
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,840
can see that there's L's and J's that

124
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,840
represent the starts and ends of beams

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,319
and different octaves are represented by

126
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,639
doubling or tripling the

127
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,919
letter little Pond is actually a set of

128
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,440
macros for the scheme programming

129
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,759
language which is a kind of variant on

130
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,759
list and so you can actually write

131
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,400
computer code in Lily Pond and here we

132
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,080
have the same representation you can see

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,360
again backs slashes indicating uh starts

134
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,479
of larger musical elements time

135
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,400
signatures bar lines that are explicitly

136
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,080
encoded with what they look like and so

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,120
on

138
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,759
melisma was an interesting uh code

139
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,879
format that's a little bit similar to

140
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,319
what we might have with midi and what

141
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:14,199
we're doing here is we're encoding only

142
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,840
uh the numeric duration so we can say

143
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,720
that I guess uh

144
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,560
125 is a 302nd note and we can figure

145
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,599
out from there that 500 is an eighth

146
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,319
note and so on and on the far right

147
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,319
column we have the pitch encoded so

148
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,319
we're losing here

149
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,319
beams and some other things we we're

150
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,240
actually been losing the clef and the

151
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,639
time seure but we do have an info tag

152
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,680
that tells us a key

153
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,280
signature algro is a more compact

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:52,639
version the same format looks like we

155
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:56,280
have midi numbers 72 74 72 um for C DC

156
00:07:52,639 --> 00:08:00,159
and so on and um I believe 64 is

157
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,520
encoding the velocity that is having how

158
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,400
loud each note is and since we haven't

159
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,879
encoded any Dynamics here they're all

160
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,639
64s and we have toward the end start and

161
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:15,120
end offsets of each note I think if we

162
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:19,639
can go through Note One 2 3 4 five 6 7 8

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:25,280
nine would be a rest and at 1 two 3 4

164
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:26,639
five 6 7 8 um we have there sorry we're

165
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,319
not doing start and end we're doing

166
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,159
start offset and duration and there we

167
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:35,719
have have a start offset Note 8 of 2.5

168
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,080
duration of one and then the next

169
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,240
element does not start at 3.5 but it

170
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,519
just starts at 3.75 so we're not even

171
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,680
encoding rests we're saying that they

172
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,240
are gaps in the

173
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,959
musical

174
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,680
format director musicus is also a list

175
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,519
based format I believe that's why we

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,240
have all these extra parentheses where

177
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,640
we're loading things into a stack and we

178
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,440
can see that we're encoding uh the meter

179
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,600
after the first note it's kind of

180
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,480
interesting and um 302 notes are one

181
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,680
over 32 that's kind of nice um the

182
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,640
dotted uh eighth note is 316th notes

183
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,200
wrong long so we see 316th can be

184
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,279
interesting for

185
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:26,240
ahead score has come up at least once in

186
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:29,920
class it is perhaps the best uh most

187
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,519
beautiful music editor ever

188
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,640
this is how a user might input

189
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,040
score and it makes it a little bit

190
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,240
easier to enter things you're putting

191
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,440
slashes between notes and so on and then

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,800
it generates an internal syntax that uh

193
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,720
specifies exactly where on the page

194
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,839
every note is and so musical engravers

195
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,560
really like working with score because

196
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,399
you can precisely move things around

197
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,399
probably a professional engraver would

198
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,279
have moved the C at the beginning of the

199
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,040
second measure a little bit to the right

200
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,480
because it's a little bit close to that

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,279
bar line and you might confuse the bar

202
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,360
line for a stem so score is sometimes

203
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,720
still used even though it hasn't been

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,360
updated in

205
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,640
decades this is music XML as we've seen

206
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,000
from Michael Good's presentation it is

207
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:28,000
uh much more verbose format um things

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,480
are uh displayed you know it takes a lot

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
more space to do it but music XML was

210
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
invented around the year 2000 some of

211
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
these other formats were around since

212
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,040
the 80s so there's a lot more space on

213
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,639
the hard drive well there are hard

214
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,399
drives now um to be able to store all

215
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:47,040
this information so here craigp has

216
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,160
simply highlighted the part uh one

217
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,240
measure in order to see how this would

218
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,720
work in music

219
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,200
XML Mei is another format you can't

220
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,800
really see things here but it's very

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,240
similar to music XML it's um

222
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,040
as we said it's the format or as Michael

223
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,519
good said is a format mostly used by

224
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,399
professional musicologists and almost

225
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,760
nobody else for for encoding common

226
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,200
western music notation I don't see it as

227
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,360
having advantages over music XML and in

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,000
fact uh has many disadvantages because

229
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,519
it's not supported by many formats but

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,560
Mei can also encode music such as

231
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,079
Medieval music um which uses different

232
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,560
representation format so it has a

233
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,560
particular

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,800
Niche this is a standard midi file

235
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,600
represented in binary and it's a little

236
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,639
bit unfair to compare the two because

237
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,920
it's a binary format so we can't really

238
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,040
see anything but look at what's um been

239
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,839
highlighted here we begin with

240
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,079
0090 which is the indication for a note

241
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,680
off so we're ending the previous note if

242
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:01,079
we go to the beginning of the next line

243
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,279
we can see ad0 which is the beginning of

244
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:09,399
a note on and then 4D which let's see if

245
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:15,199
I can still wear my heximal so 4 * 16 is

246
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:18,720
64 add D to that that is uh what was

247
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:22,720
that I don't know 14 13 and so you end

248
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,720
up somewhere around 70 uh 78 or so which

249
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,720
is the representation of the note F and

250
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:34,519
then the 40 after that is 64 in

251
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,959
um uh in in decimal and so that would be

252
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,040
the velocity how hard we're hitting

253
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,480
since velocity hasn't been encoded in

254
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,839
this and there's a number between 0 and

255
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,560
127 64 seems a pretty good number and

256
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:52,000
then we state that the note is turned

257
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,639
off with the 90 and we say it's turned

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,800
off after a certain amount of time so

259
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,920
how much time has passed and you'll see

260
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,519
this 51 seems to be a represent

261
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,000
of the length of a 16th

262
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,959
note if you really want to look at midi

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,600
you want to use a translator there's one

264
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,079
in music 21 there's one other places

265
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,760
that will translate this format into a

266
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,399
series of events like no on no offs

267
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,440
pitch bends and the time Deltas which

268
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:25,800
move us forward in time that will allow

269
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,440
you to actually give this uh particular

270
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,839
a fair

271
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,800
shape you can see also this is nith

272
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:39,600
format which has um which craigp has uh

273
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,680
translated some of the um some of the

274
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,959
hexad decimals into particular uh

275
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,320
letters so that we can see what they are

276
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,519
um somewhere in the middle of the page I

277
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,279
see CLA I see fing fingering I see a

278
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,160
font change glissant harp uh I'm not

279
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,079
sure that this is oh this these are just

280
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,959
all the things that could be in here so

281
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:02,560
we haven't even gotten to encoding the

282
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:06,160
uh the piece yet but basically niif

283
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:10,199
encodes where each shape is on the page

284
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,399
it is a format used by music scanners

285
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:15,279
it's not used very much anymore but the

286
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,160
idea is that it's much more important to

287
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,079
get an exact representation of what the

288
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,079
page looks like rather than what it

289
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,240
might

290
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,959
encode the last format which uh in this

291
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,519
presentation Flex outputs first isn't

292
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,279
really a digital format at all but is

293
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,040
the Braille music code which is US

294
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:39,000
encoding of music notation that was

295
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,040
created by Louis proud um at about the

296
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,600
same time that he created the text

297
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,680
Braille so he was really interested in

298
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,360
music en coding also and we can see some

299
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,560
parts of Braille that does encode a clef

300
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,279
even though it's not really used um in

301
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,040
the reading because we're going to

302
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,680
encode specific notes why encoded cleff

303
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,360
because um

304
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,240
because blind and uh visually impaired

305
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,000
musicians often need to talk to

306
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,800
musicians who have sight so it's easy to

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,880
say well you know it's in trouble clap

308
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,880
and there's one flat key signature and

309
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,040
so on um so there's a time signature and

310
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,839
then that's not October 5th it's octave

311
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,040
5 we set the octave we see that there's

312
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,720
a C8 we encode in augmentation dot d32

313
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,480
C32

314
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,560
c16th uh

315
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,240
F16 and so on and so there's um

316
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:38,240
interestingly we can usually get both

317
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,360
the note and the duration into a six dot

318
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,680
segment which would represent six b six

319
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,160
bits or less than a bite so it's a very

320
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,480
efficient encoding that makes it reading

321
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,839
music with your fingers very

322
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,000
fast if you want to know more about the

323
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,040
Rosetta Stone and these various musical

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,440
encodings I have also included cra saps

325
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,440
which I'll video thanks for watching
