1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,839
warm welcome to Bangkok and the

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,040
opportunity to speak with you today and

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,000
tell you about our company which is a

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,879
novel application of AI in the in the

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,520
realm of financial

6
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,400
technology um my name is unus Sim I'm

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,119
the CTO and co-founder of almond fintech

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,880
at almond we are developing the the new

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,880
standard for how money moves

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,719
globally what started that MIT SL years

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,719
ago um turned into a team of 30 diverse

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,719
and highly motivated

13
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:43,719
people we are driven by solving one big

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,480
problem that is the global funds

15
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:51,399
transfer system is broken on average it

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,039
takes 6% in fees to move money A to B

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,960
that means if you send $100 the

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,239
recipient only receives

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,600
94 furthermore due to the the banking

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,519
holidays and the business hours it often

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,839
takes one or two business days for your

22
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,920
money to reach its recipient this is not

23
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,439
only a problem for the individuals but

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,080
also for millions of companies that rely

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,600
on paying their overseas suppliers or

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,560
partners and the the counterparty and

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,560
foreign exchange risks that are

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
prevalent in these transactions are

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,079
often baked in to the economics so the

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,079
costs are even

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,000
higher this is how the the traditional

32
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,920
uh crossb Finance flow currently works

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
when you send money from one country to

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
another let's say from the US to

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
Thailand your money hops through

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
multiple financial institutions

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,360
including one or more intermediaries

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,680
along the way each hop adds cost and

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,799
delays as well as uh unreliability into

40
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,439
the

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,920
system in comparison this is the novel

42
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,880
almond uh transfer protocol that we have

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,200
developed instead of using intermediary

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,360
manag institutions we route each

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,800
transfer through a series of uh crypto

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,599
exchanges this network of crypto

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,680
exchanges is monitored and analyzed by

48
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,040
almond and we identify the best route

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,280
through a series of exchanges and

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,480
cryptocurrencies to optimize the route

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,680
in order to reduce the cost and the

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,160
delay for each individual

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:32,040
transfer looking under the hood our

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,160
system ingests a lot lot of data um

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,840
mainly the the volatilities of the

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,080
crypto and the Fiat currencies that we

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,400
use as well as the forecasted rates and

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,000
fees we also take into account the

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,360
demand projections from our partners we

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,480
use AI algorithms to uh process this

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,319
data and in return get an optimized

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,720
route and the optimized time for each

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,959
individual transfer across the 100 plus

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
cryptocurrencies that we work with and

65
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,720
the 12 crypto exchanges each individual

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,200
transfer takes the optimal route from A

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,599
to B in order to reduce the cost and the

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,400
delay and we pass on those benefits to

69
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,879
our

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,200
partners so that's enough Theory let's

71
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,760
look at a real example I just pulled

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,400
this data yesterday this is uh January

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,480
20th um if you were to send money from

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,519
the US to Thailand yesterday and went to

75
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,280
wise or Bank of America the rates you

76
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:33,319
would see would be

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,560
34.2 um and 32 3 3.2 um

78
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,400
respectively if you were to do the same

79
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,360
operation through almond

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,239
yesterday the rate you would see is

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,280
36.99 almost

82
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,000
37 this corresponds to over a 6%

83
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,159
improvement over the rate of our closest

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,720
competitors if you were to send $100,000

85
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,280
this results in over 200,000 um bot in

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,680
savings these are the savings that

87
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,120
almond shares with its

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,840
customers I must admit yesterday was a

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,439
spectacular day on average uh across the

90
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,480
last 30 days our price Advantage is

91
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,120
close to 2% over our closest comparator

92
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,280
and again if you were to send $100,000

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,800
each time your savings come up to around

94
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,960
75,000

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,039
BT in addition to our rate Advantage um

96
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,639
our value proposition also includes 24 7

97
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,919
365

98
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,120
availability um this is because

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,800
blockchain is fast faster than

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,240
traditional Financial rails and also our

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,880
crypto exchanges unlike Banks don't have

102
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,919
banking hours they don't sleep they

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,759
don't have holidays so we can send money

104
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,800
any day of the year any time of the year

105
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,080
uh in near real time and by making the

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,720
settlements just in time and limiting

107
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,680
the delays as much as possible we thus

108
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,160
reduce the foreign exchange and the

109
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,320
counterparty risk associated with

110
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,680
traditional

111
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,280
finance a quick case study we are

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,520
working with a global um credit card

113
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,800
payment company um on a pilot between

114
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,000
the US and Brazil over the last quarter

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,880
we moved

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,800
$800,000 in the same Corridor uh and

117
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,720
over overall we saved on average eight

118
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,000
basis points net to our partner and each

119
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,240
transfer vast majority of our transfers

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,560
took less than five

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,280
minutes um taking a step back uh this is

122
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,240
our Global traction last year we have

123
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,479
moved $8.8 million across 10 countries

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,680
our Network includes 12 exchanges and 19

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,000
customers uh we offer rates across 30 30

126
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,199
uh Fiat Pairs and over 100

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,960
cryptocurrency

128
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,720
exchanges and finally most importantly

129
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,400
uh Thailand is Thailand poses a very

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,840
significant opportunity for us we are

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,960
already in talks with B's regulator

132
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,080
sandbox program we are working with bitb

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,360
uh as one of our exchanges in our

134
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,160
Network we have demonstrated transfers

135
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,080
between Singapore and Thailand as well

136
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,759
as the US and Thailand and we are

137
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,199
looking for Partnerships with

138
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,520
International companies for funds

139
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,720
transfers between Thailand aan and

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,479
Americas if you're interested in working

141
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,880
together or just want to learn more I
