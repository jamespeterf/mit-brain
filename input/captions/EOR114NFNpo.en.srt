1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,490
Victory Yinka-Banjo was born
and raised in Lagos, Nigeria

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,180
and moved to the United States
on a student visa in 2021

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,190
to attend MIT.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,960
She's majoring in Course 6-7, or
computer science and molecular

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,020
biology.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,440
And she's done
undergraduate research

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,590
with Professor Jonathan Weissman
at the Whitehead Institute

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,370
and Professor Caroline Uhler
at the Broad Institute.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,010
Currently, Victory is
preparing for graduate school,

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,200
where she'll prepare--

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,750
pursue her interest
in molecular medicine.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,080
And for those of
you here who are not

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,120
involved in this
process, I'll mention

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,090
that the applications
to most graduate schools

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,220
were due Sunday.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,620
So between that and
this performance,

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,760
I'm not sure how restful
Victory's Thanksgiving break

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,160
was.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,510
Victory excels in science,
in computational thinking

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,910
and also in the arts.

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,210
She's involved with the
MIT Black Theater Guild

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,590
and has composed and
performed spoken word poetry

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,540
for MIT student groups and
for the celebration of Sally

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,700
Kornbluth's inauguration.

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,830
For today's celebration
of the life sciences,

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,470
Victory will present
her piece "Systems,"

28
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,580
which will weave together ideas
about systems of molecules,

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,700
disciplines, people
and countries.

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,550
Please join me in
welcoming Victory.

31
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
[APPLAUSE]

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:55,265

33
00:01:55,265 --> 00:02:05,810
M. I. T. As my words
meet your minds and minds

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,780
meet your hands and your
hearts, I need you to zoom out.

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,820
Adjust the magnification
of the lens

36
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,800
that you walked into this
room viewing the world through

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
and give me a chance to
communicate what I argue

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,290
is an extended breakthrough.

39
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,830
Because if there was one
thing that my pending biology

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,780
degree has shown
me, it is that there

41
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,710
is power in thinking beyond
what exists in our proximity.

42
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,590
Now, travel with me to
a world observable only

43
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,320
by electron microscopy
and you will find

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,810
meaning behind this philosophy.

45
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,360
Now, under a microscope adjusted
to its highest magnification,

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,150
you might see a nucleus, a
mitochondrion, a ribosome,

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,300
individual organelles packed
with biological power.

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,670
But if you dare to zoom
out, what you will find

49
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,280
is the subcellular
components operating

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,420
in ways far more powerful
because together they are parts

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,880
of a whole, subparts of a cell.

52
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,790
In synergy, these organelles--
they form a system of whole cell

53
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,550
complexity.

54
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,950
Now, zoom out again and you'll
find that these cells come

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,830
together as tissue, and
tissue together as organs,

56
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,680
and organs with systems
of blood vessels,

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,460
and fluids and
skeletal structure.

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,030
They create something
systematically

59
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:34,550
beautiful and dependent as
every human in this room.

60
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,390
To see that you don't need an
external lab tool in accounting

61
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,610
for this larger
picture, our eyes

62
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,740
do more than a
microscope's view see.

63
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,840
Gone are the days of
reductionist biology

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,600
of taking pieces apart,
considering them individually.

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,610
We are at MIT, so we
build with mind and hand,

66
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,490
put pieces together.

67
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,050
This collaborative is not just
about one part, one subject,

68
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,030
just about biology.

69
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,490
It is interdisciplinary and
to claim otherwise is to fail

70
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,290
to zoom out and look back on
our rich history of revolutions,

71
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,110
be ignorant of our promising
future of expansions,

72
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,920
a history of fundamental
discovery decorated

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,120
by the sequencing
of the human genome,

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,079
unleashing a scientific
era broader than the Broad

75
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,640
Institute, a history of sharp
Nobel laureates transforming RNA

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,270
splicing and medical imaging,
a history that birthed HST,

77
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,510
solidifying relations from
MGH and Harvard Med to MIT,

78
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,160
and a future of expansions
with breakthrough synergy that

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,270
advances cell and gene
therapy, uses AI to accelerate

80
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,810
diagnostics and fight antibiotic
resistance of mechanical

81
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,910
engineering building 3D-printed
hearts that pump life into new

82
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,780
treatments, a future of
memories governed by McGovern's,

83
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,410
collaborations with the Picower
and understanding of brains

84
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,610
fueled by molecular power.

85
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,090
This collaborative is
not just about biology.

86
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,370
It is a celebration of
an institute and industry

87
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,980
identical to a table where
everyone can find a seat.

88
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,090
A celebration of a
system built by parts

89
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,280
where everyone
finds their niche,

90
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,720
whether that's in
science and engineering,

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,480
where you can
interface technology

92
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,820
into clinical medicine
to develop a therapy

93
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,780
and design its delivery.

94
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,540
But for that therapy to
become a patient's reality,

95
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,690
we need people who
innovate beyond science

96
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,740
to overcome policy, understand
the nuances of clinical trials

97
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,680
and testing.

98
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,040
We have to think about
the markets governed

99
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,670
by a for-profit motive.

100
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,690
And so we need economists
for investor connecting

101
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,710
and for strategized
research funding.

102
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,020
But we also need entrepreneurs
for commercialization advancing

103
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,220
and for biotechnology
proliferating.

104
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,160
And, of course,
we need physicians

105
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,700
to understand the anatomy
of the very people impacted

106
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,310
by this pipeline
of R&D to ensure

107
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,350
the final life-changing delivery
that brings all of this back

108
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,850
to the ordinary people going
about everyday life activities,

109
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,090
see all these [INAUDIBLE]
must synergize

110
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,530
to go from bench to bedside.

111
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,780
But to claim that this
collaborative is only

112
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,100
about medicine is to ignore
the achievable global scales

113
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,550
of science where living
systems can power

114
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,550
the sustainability of life
on Earth as we know it.

115
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,960
Enzymes for plastic waste
degradation, bacteria

116
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,900
for decarbonized food
production, [INAUDIBLE] scales

117
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,930
that allow us to zoom out
of continental borders,

118
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,530
considering systems
of land bridged

119
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,200
by oceans, networks
of nations and synergy

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,570
to tackle global
health issues, networks

121
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,500
of nations that come together
to deliver breakthroughs

122
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,530
like a record time vaccine for
a pandemic that was unforeseen,

123
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,010
networks of nations
extending from the Americas

124
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,480
to the ends of the
Earth, including Asia,

125
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,680
including Europe, including
Africa, where I come from.

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,300
Gone are the days where science
just stays within our proximity.

127
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,570
To be at MIT is to take
our innovations and science

128
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,540
to a world that needs it
but also bring the world

129
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,120
to a science that needs
it, bringing people like me

130
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,810
to a campus where
they're welcomed.

131
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,730
Would you have imagined that a
Nigerian-born visa holder would

132
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,800
discover at MIT her superpower,
that at the crossroads

133
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
of computation and
biology she would tower,

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,110
would break glass ceilings
and surmount racially

135
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,610
discriminatory systems,
a woman who 100 years ago

136
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,680
would have been a
victim but today

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,210
is contributing
to the advancement

138
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,780
of multiple disciplines.

139
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,940
To be at MIT is to strive to
increase the representation

140
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,070
of minority groups,
where even when

141
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,420
we have declining
diversity in admissions,

142
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,050
we can hold steadfast to our
exemplary all-women president,

143
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,600
provost, and
chancellor positions

144
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,580
and hope the next
time we do better.

145
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,690
To be at MIT is to contribute
to an era of infinite impact.

146
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,500
It is to look beyond the
microscope, zooming out

147
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,910
to embrace the grander scope.

148
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,670
To be at MIT is
to latch onto hope

149
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,940
so that in spite of a global
pandemic, we fight and we cope.

150
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,270
We fight with science and
policy across clinics, academia

151
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,419
and industry for the betterment
of our planet, for our rights,

152
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,200
for our health.

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,360
We fight with might.

154
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,120
To be at MIT is to
pursue translation

155
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,549
for more than just Cambridge,
for more than Massachusetts,

156
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,120
for more than one nation,
for a network of nations,

157
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,102
for the globe.

158
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:47,620

159
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,410
It is right here,
right now that we

160
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,900
set this foundation and
this continuous pacesetting.

161
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,480
Oh, it goes far beyond
differential equations.

162
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,190
It will take collective actions
today, our minds and our hands

163
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,835
to ensure a future that
outlasts us tomorrow.

164
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:07,335
MIT.

165
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:10,360

166
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,950
To be here is a privilege,
one that we can pay forward.

167
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,750
So will you exist as yourself,
as an individual cell

168
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,900
unnoticed without a
microscope or will you

169
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,480
become visible by
staying connected

170
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,970
to the far-reaching life
science and health system?

171
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,500
Will you zoom out.

172
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,600

173
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,350
[APPLAUSE]
