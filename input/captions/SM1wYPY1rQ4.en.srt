00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,320
climate goals may take longer but we'll

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,120
get there Mass state Senator Mike

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,880
Barrett describes State's progress on

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,599
tackling global warming remains

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,720
optimistic despite short-term delays

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,439
written by the MIT energy initiative the

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,400
covid-19 pandemic inflation and the war

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,680
in Ukraine have combined to cause

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,560
unavoidable delays in implementation of

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,679
massachusetts's ambitious goals to

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,880
tackle climate change state Senator Mike

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,760
Barrett said Wednesday April 19 2023

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
during his presentation at the MIT

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,280
energy initiative Mighty Earth Day

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
colloquium but he added he remains

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,360
optimistic that the goals will be

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,920
reached with a lag of perhaps 2 years

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,239
Barrett who is Senate chair of the

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,640
state's joint committee on

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,719
telecommunications utilities and energy

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,640
spoke on the topic of decarbonizing

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,520
Massachusetts at mit's Wong Auditorium

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,800
as part of the Institute celebration of

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,519
Earth week the event was accompanied by

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,640
a poster session highlighting some of

27
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,600
the work of MIT students and faculty

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,200
aimed at tackling aspects of the climate

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,320
issue Martha broad mighty's executive

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,200
director introduced Barrett by pointing

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,280
out that he was largely responsible for

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,560
the passage of two major climate related

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,159
bills by the Massachusetts legislature

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,720
the road map act in 2021 and the drive

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,400
act in 2022 which together helped to

36
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,840
place the state as one of the nation's

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,799
leaders in the implementation of

38
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,040
measures to ratchet down greenhouse gas

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,159
emissions the two key pieces of

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,840
legislation Barrett said were

41
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,920
complicated bills that included many

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,840
components but a major feature of the

43
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,600
road map Act was to reduce the time

44
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,000
between reassessments of the state's

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,640
climate plans from 10 years to five and

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,119
to divide the targets for emissions

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
reductions into six separate categories

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,719
instead of just a single overall number

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,040
the six sectors the Bild delineated are

50
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,079
Transportation commercial industrial and

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,799
institutional buildings residential

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,799
buildings industrial processes natural

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,000
gas infrastructure and electricity

54
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,039
generation each of these faces different

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,399
challenges and needs to be evaluated

56
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,680
separately he said the second Bill the

57
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,200
drive act sets specific targets for

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,759
implementation of carbon-free

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,920
electricity generation we prioritize

60
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,800
offshore wind he pointed out because

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,599
that's one resource where Massachusetts

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,000
has a real Edge over other states and

63
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,080
regions because of especially shallow

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,959
offshore Waters and strong steady

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,599
offshore winds that tend to be strongest

66
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,480
during the peak demand hours of late

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,239
afternoon and evening the state's

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,120
Coastal waters are an especially

69
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,680
promising site for offshore wind farms

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
he said whereas the majority of offshore

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,920
wind installations around the world are

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,160
in deep water which precludes fixed

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,239
foundations and adds significantly to

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,159
construction costs massachusetts'

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
shallow Waters can allow relatively

76
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,360
inexpensive construction so you can see

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,120
why offshore wind became a Lynch pin not

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,159
only to cleaning up the grid but to

79
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,920
feeding it into the building system and

80
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,879
for that matter into transportation for

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,599
our electric vehicles he said

82
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,239
massachusetts's needs in addressing

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,040
climate change are quite different from

84
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,519
Global averages or even us averages he

85
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,080
pointed out worldwide agriculture

86
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,000
accounts for some 22% of greenhouse gas

87
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,239
emissions and 11% nationally in

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,640
Massachusetts the figure is less than a

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,920
half of 1% the industrial sector is also

90
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,680
much smaller than the national average

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,280
meanwhile buildings account for only

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,040
about 6% of us emissions but 13% in the

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,120
state that means that overall buildings

94
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,560
transportation and power generation

95
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,000
become the whole ball game for this

96
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,360
state requiring a real focus and terms

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,080
of our thinking he said because of that

98
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,040
in those climate bills we really

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,480
insisted on reducing emissions in the

100
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,680
energy generation sector and our primary

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,000
way to get there lies with wind and most

102
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,680
of that is offshore the law calls for

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,760
emissions from power generation to be

104
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,439
cut by 53% by 2025 and 70% by 2030

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,120
meeting that goal depends heavily on

106
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,319
offshore wind clean power is critical

107
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,040
because the transmission and

108
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,799
transportation in buildings depend on

109
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,280
clean power an offshore wind is critical

110
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,280
to that clean power strategy he said at

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,159
the time the bills passed plans for new

112
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,560
offshore Wind Farm installations showed

113
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,760
that the state was well on target to

114
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,480
meet these goals Barrett said there was

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,959
plenty of reason for Massachusetts to

116
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,440
feel very optimistic about offshore wind

117
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,359
everyone was bullish well Massachusetts

118
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,320
is a small state 44th out of 50 because

119
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,000
of its unusually favorable offshore

120
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,600
conditions we are second in the United

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,400
States in terms of plans to deploy

122
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,720
offshore wind after New York he said but

123
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,800
then the real world got in the way as

124
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,600
Europe and the UK quickly tried to Pivot

125
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,840
away from natural gas and oil in the

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,919
picture changed quickly offshore wind

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,039
suddenly had a lot of competition for

129
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,680
the expertise the equipment and the

130
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,520
materials he said as just one example he

131
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,199
said the ships needed for installation

132
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,560
became unavailable suddenly worldwide

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,160
there weren't enough installation

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
vessels to hold these very heavy

135
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,479
components that have to be brought out

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,440
to see he said about 20 to 40 such

137
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,680
vessels are needed to install a single

138
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,560
Wind Farm there are a limited number of

139
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,120
these vessels capable of carrying these

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,080
huge pieces of infrastructure in the

141
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,880
world and in the wake of stepped up

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,960
demand from Europe and other places

143
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,280
including China there was an enormous

144
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,759
shortage of appropriate vessels that

145
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,400
wasn't the only obstacle prices of some

146
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,440
key Commodities also shot up partly due

147
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,360
to supply chain issues associated with

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
the pandemic and the resulting worldwide

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
inflation the ramifications of these

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,960
kinds of disruptions obviously have been

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,600
felt worldwide he said for example the

152
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,440
horn sea project off the coast the UK is

153
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,880
the largest proposed offshore wind farm

154
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,479
in the world and one the UK was strongly

155
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,600
dependent on to meet climate targets but

156
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,199
the developer of the project oread said

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,800
it could no longer proceed without a

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,880
major government bailout at this point

159
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,880
the project remains in limbo in

160
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Massachusetts the company aveng grid had

161
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,800
a contract to build 60 offshore wind

162
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,160
turbines to deliver 1,200 megaw of power

163
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,240
but last month in a highly unusual move

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,720
for a major company they informed

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,800
Massachusetts that they were terminating

166
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,479
ating a contract they had signed that

167
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,960
contract was a big part of the state's

168
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,960
overall clean energy strategy he said a

169
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,479
second developer that had also signed a

170
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,759
contract for a 1,200 megawatt offshore

171
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,800
Farm signaled that it too could not meet

172
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,639
its contract we technically haven't

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
failed yet in meeting the goals that

174
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,759
were set for emissions reduction Barrett

175
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,240
said in theory we have 2 years to

176
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,759
recover from the setbacks that I'm

177
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,680
describing realistically though he said

178
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,199
it is quite likely that we're not going

179
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,400
to hit our 2025 and 2030 benchmark

180
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,560
but despite all this Barrett ended his

181
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,080
remarks on an essentially optimistic

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,479
note I hate to see us fall off Pace in

183
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,520
any way he said but he added the truth

184
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,560
is that a short delay and I think we're

185
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,240
looking at just a couple of years delay

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,599
is a speed bump it's not a roadblock it

187
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,960
is not the end of climate policy

188
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,080
worldwide demand for offshore wind power

189
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,120
remains extraordinary said Barrett

190
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,080
mainly as a result of the need to get

191
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,280
off of Russian fossil fuel as a result

192
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,360
eventually Supply will come into balance

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,240
with this demand the balance will be

194
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,080
restored to monitor the process Barrett

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,440
said he has submitted legislation to

196
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,919
create a new independent climate policy

197
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,560
commission to examine in detail the data

198
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,199
on performance in meeting the state's

199
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,800
climate goals and to make

200
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,560
recommendations the measure would

201
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,720
provide open access to information for

202
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,400
the public allowing everyone to see the

203
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,879
progress being made from an unbiased

204
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,639
Source setbacks are going to happen he

205
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,479
said this is a tough tough job while the

206
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,000
real world is going to to surprise us

207
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,560
persistence is critical he concluded

208
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,360
that I think we're going to wind up

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,639
building every windmill that we need for

210
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,960
our emissions reduction policy just not

211
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,919
on the timeline that we had hoped

212
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,440
