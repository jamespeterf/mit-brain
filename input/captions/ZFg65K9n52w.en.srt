1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:11,200
In our case, uh, we developed the whole

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:14,320
imaging platform in order to see what

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,240
our activity regulated genes do in the

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,400
brain because we knew they had to do

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,279
with plasticity. We knew many of them

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,279
were synaptic, but we did we wanted to

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,359
see what was actually happening at

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,880
synapses when these genes are not

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,599
present or they're mutated. And so but

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,600
the ability to actually monitor uh

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:39,440
synapses in the living brain um was not

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,360
there when I started. Um and around the

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,559
time that I started was when two photon

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,800
microscopy which is the tool that people

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:53,280
use to image deep into tissue was being

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:58,239
uh first implemented in relation to um

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,840
biological samples. Um but no one had

18
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,440
looked at it at that level of

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
resolution.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,680
Um and part of that was being able to

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
also label the syninnapse so that you

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
could see them. So it has two parts. One

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,720
is the microscopy, the other is the

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,720
labeling. And so we could do the

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,080
labeling as a molecular lab and uh my

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,479
colleague Peter So um could build the

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,119
microscopes that we needed. And so

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,680
uh some aspects of the technology when

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,560
we started there were no commercially

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,280
available microscopes of this time you

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,360
had to build them and at that point we

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
started we were imaging only in one

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,079
color so we could just see neurons and

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,119
that's when we identified the inhibitory

35
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,720
neurons as being particularly

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,439
plastic.

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,600
Um and then we started thinking well if

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,920
the inhibitory neurons are particularly

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,280
plastic we want to look at those

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,159
synapses specifically. Um but there was

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,399
actually no tool available to look at

42
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,240
them. They have no structural surrogate

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,479
or something where you can look at the

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,399
entire cell. Excitatory synapses live on

45
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,039
these little protrusions that are

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,000
spines. And so people even by doing a

47
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,440
cell fill could sort of say, "Oh, this I

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,280
see these little spines. That means

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
that's where the excitatory synapses

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,400
are." But inhibitory neurons don't have

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,680
that. And so we developed a um a tool

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,920
where we actually tagged um inhibitory

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,000
synaptic proteins that we could then

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
track in vivo.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,920
And so then we started looking at

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,239
inhibitory synapses. And indeed we saw

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,000
that they were extremely dynamic. We

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
first of all I mean it was really the

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,599
first view of where they lived on this

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,280
cell. Um and so we found that they were

61
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,080
in all kinds of places that people

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,280
didn't expect them to be. So just being

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,840
able to see them um gave us a view of

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,239
where they target the excitatory

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,440
neurons. Um and that also had

66
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,959
implications for how they work. Um and

67
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,080
then

68
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,239
once we started being able to see them

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
um in order to do that we had to label

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,519
them and we had to see the cell too. So

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,800
we had to image in two colors. So around

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,280
the time when people started the two

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,519
photon microscopes

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,319
then became available like after we had

75
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,480
done our one color the one color became

76
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,760
available commercially and then we

77
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,319
started doing two colors. So we always

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,720
stayed a little bit ahead in terms of

79
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,879
the technology and so now you can buy a

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,680
twocolor two photon. They're less

81
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,599
flexible than our systems. Uh but now

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,680
we're imaging in three colors. There's

83
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,680
still not a threecolor microscope

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,000
available um that you can buy. And the

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,319
other thing is that we can kind of

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,519
change our microscope design depending

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:05,040
on what it is we're asking. Um and so I

88
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,239
think the um

89
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,360
the technology development um and also

90
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,879
integrating the molecular labeling with

91
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,720
the

92
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,720
microscopy has been very powerful. Um

93
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,799
and I I I think that this is something

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
that's why I'm I stay here, right?

95
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,880
Because I feel like this is something

96
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,880
special here.
