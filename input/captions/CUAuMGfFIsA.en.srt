1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,040
hello everyone good morning welcome to

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,679
the mpg primer today we are excited to

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,280
have Elizabeth Doren she's a fourth year

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,320
PhD student in alus prices group in the

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,719
department of epidemiology at Harvard

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,279
Chan School of Public Health before

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,039
beginning her doctoral studies she

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,400
earned her undergraduate degree at

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,439
Vanderbilt University where she studied

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,760
molecular biology human and

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,599
organizational development and music I

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,960
just learned she played the viola um her

13
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,120
current research focuses on developing

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,320
computational methods to link regulatory

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,160
elements to their target genes using

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,840
single cell data um so Elizabeth take it

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,000
away oh um please feel free to ask

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,039
questions um throughout the talk if you

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
have them there's two mics located in

20
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,360
the center of the room um also if you

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,800
raise your hand I could run over and

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
give you a mic thank

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,920
you like I have a laser point here going

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,920
on

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,000
okay I'll just put that down there all

26
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,759
right um morning everybody I'm Elizabeth

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,159
I'm very excited to talk to you all

28
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:15,360
today about this new technology that has

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:19,159
the potential to measure biology at a

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,200
really unprecedented uh resolution and I

31
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,000
actually want to start by kind of

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,799
framing the goals of my presentation um

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,240
as you all might know the number of

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,360
single cell Technologies single cell

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,479
data sets and single cell anal analysis

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,240
methods is huge and rapidly growing

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,159
there might even be a few out uh new by

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,520
the end of this presentation so with

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,360
that in mind uh the goal of my talk

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:50,200
today is less to dive into the specifics

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,479
of a particular technology or the math

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,320
of a specific analysis method and more

43
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:59,360
so to gain uh kind of a broad

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,799
appreciation and intuition for the Big

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,640
Technical challenges in the world of

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,079
single cell technology and single cell

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,079
data

48
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,400
analysis all

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,280
right so here is an outline of my

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,440
presentation today um first we'll

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,040
discuss kind of emerging single cell

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,280
multi Technologies starting of course by

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,599
understanding what is single cell

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,239
technology and then more specifically

55
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,400
what is single cell multi

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,519
technology and hopefully the bulk of the

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,599
discussion will be on analysis methods

58
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,680
which I imagine are of greatest interest

59
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,480
to this audience um we will learn what

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,720
questions single cell multi data can

61
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,319
answer we will discuss the major

62
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,519
technical challenges um currently in

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,040
single cell multi data analysis and I'll

64
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,000
finish with a sort of in-depth look at

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,560
one example area of inquiry and single

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,840
cell multi data which is computationally

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,840
linking enhancers to their target Gene

68
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,000
okay so to start um what is single cell

69
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,640
technology so as I'm sure um many of you

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,599
might be aware single cell technology

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,760
refers to a family of sequencing

72
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,120
technologies that measure biology at the

73
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,120
level of individual cells so traditional

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,080
sequencing Technologies referred to as

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,400
bulk Technologies make biological

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,200
measurements that reflect the biology of

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,400
a group of cells perhaps from a tissue

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,200
sample or cell culture um they produce

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,120
one quantitative readout per sample

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,840
reflecting kind of the average profile

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,560
of biology within that sample whereas

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,439
single cell Technologies um produce many

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,200
quantitative readouts one per cell

84
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,200
reflecting the biology of that

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,519
particular

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,400
cell so it's perhaps intuitive but why

87
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,319
these days is everyone interested in

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,840
single cell data so a popular metaphor

89
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,680
highlighting the benefits of single cell

90
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,239
data um is the fruit smoothie versus

91
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,359
fruit salad metaphor so we can think of

92
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,400
traditional bulk data as a fruit

93
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,040
smoothie a bunch of different fruits

94
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,199
kind of ground up and made homogeneous

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,479
and we can think of single cell data as

96
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,240
a fruit salad all of the different

97
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,960
fruits mixed together but they're

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,240
distinct textures and flavor profiles

99
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,520
are still

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,680
detectable so if we are interested in

101
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,320
learning about some characteristic of a

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,360
sample of fruits for example we can gain

103
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,280
a lot more information from a fruit

104
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,880
salad than we can from a fruit smoothie

105
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
a fruit smoothie might be able to tell

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,080
us the general characteristics of fruit

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,800
or of a particular uh population of

108
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,720
fruits in our smoothie but a fruit salad

109
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,479
is going to give us that information for

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,639
particular fruits and even particular

111
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,800
slices of the same

112
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,759
fruit so the same intuition can be

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,199
applied to a more biological example

114
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,560
perhaps if we're interested in um some

115
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,479
molecular feature within a cell like the

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,160
expression of some fictional Gene a a

117
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:24,560
traditional bulk sample is going to give

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,039
us one readout just an average

119
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,039
expression level of Gene a across all of

120
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,720
the cell types and individual cells in

121
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,520
the sample

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,639
whereas a single cell sample will

123
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,160
produce one readout per cell and

124
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,520
certainly in a real life bulk or single

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,720
cell data set there'd be way more than

126
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,600
four cells so with that there'd be way

127
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,880
more

128
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,360
heterogeneity um perhaps even at the

129
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,960
level of a subcell type or cell

130
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,400
State um so in this example we can see

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,440
how this might be compelling the bulk

132
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,840
readout shows that there is some

133
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,680
moderate level of expression of Gene a

134
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,400
whereas the Single Cell readout shows

135
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,720
that in certain cells or cell types

136
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,120
there's very high expression of Gene a

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,120
and in other cells Gene a is very lowly

138
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,840
expressed or maybe even not expressed at

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,160
all we can imagine if we're interested

140
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,039
in understanding the function of Gene a

141
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Maybe It's associated with a particular

142
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,360
disease or something like that this

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,680
unlocks a lot more insights and kind of

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,840
leads to more interesting Downstream uh

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,440
follow-up hypotheses than the simple

146
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,240
readout so to summarize single cell data

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,120
retains cellular heterogeneity it gives

148
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,919
us much higher biological resolution and

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,919
allows us to ask more specific

150
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,560
questions so what types of biology can

151
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,560
we profile at the level of a single cell

152
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,360
um single cell genomic Technologies

153
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,240
measure a variety of biological

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,280
modalities ranging from DNA sequence to

155
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,199
gene expression chromatin accessibility

156
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,400
biochemical modifications to DNA or

157
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,919
histones um this figure here just lists

158
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,560
a small subset of the biological

159
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,120
modalities and corresponding SE

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,720
sequencing technologies that are

161
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,280
currently

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,879
available um and is certainly vastly

163
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,800
expanding but these modalities are often

164
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,280
uniquely informative um and usually

165
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,319
provide complimentary insights so for

166
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,000
example if we run a single cell RNA seek

167
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:39,639
experiment um get a profile of gene

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,960
expression um across a population of

169
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,800
cells we might observe the expression of

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,599
a particular transcription factor of

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,319
interest and a subpopulation of cells

172
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,120
and we might hypothesize that this

173
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,440
transcription factor is active and is

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,919
turning on some known Gene regulatory

175
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,159
Network perhaps some information that

176
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,879
could be very useful for validating this

177
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:02,759
hypothesis is what is the chromatin

178
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,639
accessibility landscape or DNA

179
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,639
methylation landscape in these same

180
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,120
cells do we see The Binding sites for

181
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,280
that transcription Factor accessible in

182
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,000
the same cells do we see Downstream Gene

183
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,879
enhancers accessible in those same

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,159
cells so this is where single cell multi

185
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,599
technology comes

186
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:29,520
in so single cell multi Technologies

187
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:32,479
jointly measure multiple biological

188
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,519
modalities within the same cells so

189
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,839
providing not just one biological

190
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,479
readout per molecular feature per cell

191
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,880
um but two readouts per feature per cell

192
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,360
or possibly even more than two as we'll

193
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,880
see much later in the

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,519
presentation so for the purposes of um

195
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,160
giving example for the presentation

196
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,920
today I'll primarily focus on Multi

197
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,880
technologies that jointly profile

198
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,360
chromatin accessibility and gene

199
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,600
expression this is kind of the dominant

200
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,519
subcategory of single cell multi

201
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,640
technology so I've highlighted um mRNA

202
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:12,440
and chromatin accessibility is the two

203
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,440
biological modalities of Interest

204
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,279
here um so to sort of demonstrate at not

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,680
too technical of a level how this

206
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,160
technology might work uh we all might be

207
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,240
familiar with single cell RNA sequencing

208
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,200
which of course meas measures gene

209
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,399
expression by targeting um mature

210
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,040
messenger rnas for

211
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,720
sequencing the readout of a single cell

212
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,120
RNA sequencing experiment is a gene

213
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,000
expression count Matrix with um cells as

214
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,680
rows and genes as columns or flipped a

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,279
Cell by Gene

216
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,880
Matrix similarly um a unimodal or single

217
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,720
biological modality single cell attack

218
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,839
seek experiment measures chromatin

219
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,160
accessibility uh it does this

220
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,000
using an enzyme called a transposase

221
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,920
enzyme which targets regions of open

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,480
chromatin specifically for

223
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,079
sequencing and the biological readout of

224
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,600
a single cell attack seek experiment is

225
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,000
a chromatin accessibility Matrix where

226
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,360
the counts here represent how often a

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
particular region of DNA was detected as

228
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,279
accessible by the transposase enzyme so

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,839
here we have a cell by region Matrix

230
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:34,040
this might be significant iFly um higher

231
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,760
dimensional than an RNA seek readout and

232
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,240
I'll elaborate a bit later on um what

233
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,279
the molecular features chromatin regions

234
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:48,079
might be specifically for this uh

235
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:51,440
experiment so single cell RNA and attack

236
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,959
seek multi data jointly measures RNA and

237
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,399
attack across the same single cells um

238
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,959
so both experiments are performed and

239
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,680
I'll give a zoom in on that in a second

240
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,800
and the ultimate readout is two feature

241
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,200
matrices a Cell by Gene Matrix of

242
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:12,279
expression and a Cell by region Matrix

243
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,279
of Chromatin

244
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,440
accessibility so ignoring the details in

245
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,399
this figure just to give kind of an

246
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,959
intuition for how this works

247
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,920
experimentally um this is an

248
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,079
illustration of kind of the dominant

249
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,720
technology in the multi space

250
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:32,680
particularly in the RNA and attack multi

251
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,800
space that is the 10x multi

252
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,360
technology at a basic level how this

253
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,560
works is first all cells in a sample are

254
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,639
treated with the transposase enzyme

255
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,079
which again is the essential enzyme for

256
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,600
producing the attack seek

257
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,920
readout second using very advanced

258
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,480
technology that um definitely others

259
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,800
might understand better than me um cell

260
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,320
specific and also molecule specific

261
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,560
barcodes are added to DNA and mRNA

262
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,680
molecules within each cell in the

263
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,600
sample and finally sequencing libraries

264
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:15,760
are prepared so at the end of the

265
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,959
experiment um we have a lot of gene

266
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,920
expression counts and also chromatin

267
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,760
accessibility counts that are assigned

268
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,760
to specific cells within your

269
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,240
sample all right so hopefully that

270
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,720
provides just enough technical detail to

271
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,279
to um understand kind of the readouts

272
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,279
and the potential Downstream

273
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,560
applications of these data so I'll now

274
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:42,760
move on to uh single cell multi analysis

275
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,839
methods so I'll first start with what

276
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,399
questions can single cell multi data

277
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,240
answer so again this field is kind of in

278
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,199
its early stages a very new technology

279
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,399
so instead of giving a super specific

280
00:12:53,199 --> 00:13:00,040
overview of uh one analysis method I'm

281
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,839
kind of going to give um some broad

282
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,800
descriptions of the few different areas

283
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,880
of inquiry that have been explored so

284
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,440
far and again as more data is generated

285
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,480
the types of questions we can answer

286
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,560
with this data is only going to

287
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,440
expand so here's a few biological

288
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,079
applications um that I'm going to

289
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,480
highlight first linking regulatory

290
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,600
elements to their target genes and to

291
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,440
their Upstream transcription factors

292
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,199
second inferring developmental

293
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,360
trajectories third discovery of rare or

294
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:36,120
transient cell types or states and

295
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:39,600
fourth using one modality to predict

296
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,000
another so first uh linking regulatory

297
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,920
elements to their target genes so this

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,639
is perhaps one of the most established

299
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,399
uh analyses of single cell multi RNA and

300
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,920
attack data that's out there as you can

301
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,399
see there's um several methods that have

302
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,279
already been published that perform this

303
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:02,320
function and the basic intuition behind

304
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:06,800
this style of anal is is for a given

305
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:10,040
candidate enhancer or attack region and

306
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,880
candidate Target Gene perhaps a gene in

307
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,399
the Cy region of the enhancer that we

308
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,800
think might be targeted by the enhancer

309
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,880
we have from our single cell Mulo

310
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,600
readout um chromatin accessibility the

311
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,360
accessibility status of that enhancer

312
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,399
across single cells and the expression

313
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,240
of the candidate Target Gene across

314
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,759
single cells um

315
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,600
so at a broad level what all these

316
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,680
methods do is measure the correlation or

317
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,880
the association between the activity of

318
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,759
a candidate enhancer and the expression

319
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,160
of a candidate Target Gene across single

320
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,320
cells with of course some technical

321
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,560
specifics that we might dive into a

322
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,320
little bit later um but this is kind of

323
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,519
the the broad intuition of this type of

324
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,720
analysis and we can see how single cell

325
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,639
multi data is unique uniquely unlocking

326
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,720
this ability um we have high sample size

327
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,600
uh in the form of thousands or tens of

328
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,920
thousands of single cells across which

329
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,120
to measure correlation we can also

330
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,079
really um tailor the analysis

331
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,600
specifically to our biological context

332
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,279
of Interest which because we know um

333
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,399
regulatory biology is very context

334
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,399
specific a sort of a key um benefit

335
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:32,040
here um another closely related

336
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,199
application that has been explored is

337
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,519
linking regulatory elements not only to

338
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,160
their target genes but also to the

339
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,959
transcription factors um that might

340
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,600
interact with an enhancer to activate a

341
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,560
Target Gene so a few closely related

342
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,720
methods uh like Scenic plus and reunion

343
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,720
highlighted down here might do this um

344
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,880
and again we're getting the uh gene

345
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,680
expression candidate uh Target gene

346
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,920
expression data from the RNA seek we're

347
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,759
getting the enhancer data from chromatin

348
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,279
accessibility and we're getting the

349
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,000
transcription Factor activity data also

350
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,720
from gene expression so we can kind of

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,800
measure the relationship of each of

352
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,800
these things together as a

353
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:21,160
network a second broad application is

354
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,680
inferring developmental

355
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,639
trajectories um so there is this concept

356
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,519
in regulatory biology which many of us

357
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,000
might be familiar with called chromatin

358
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,040
potential or lineage priming which

359
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,079
refers to an increase in accessibility

360
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,079
of regulatory chromatin prior to a gene

361
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,639
being turned on during development so

362
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:46,839
developmental biology is kind of this

363
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:50,560
black box there's a lot of you know

364
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,959
transient cell States and um very

365
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,600
context specific biology going on that

366
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,440
regulates the development of certain

367
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,560
cell types Etc and single cell M data

368
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,000
can be uniquely informative for this so

369
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm going to highlight an example here

370
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,559
um from an early mul paper um the Shar

371
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,480
seek technology which some of you might

372
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,760
know uh where on the bottom here I'm

373
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,720
showing that on the left side of the

374
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,839
figure that will ultimately appear um we

375
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,000
have the profile of gene expression and

376
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,079
enhancer accessibility during early

377
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,480
development of this particular example

378
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,000
is for the development of hair follicles

379
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,120
um on the right side of the figure that

380
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,880
ultimately appear we have late

381
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,880
development and um as the legend on the

382
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,960
top says red here indicates higher

383
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
counts so higher gene expression in in

384
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,559
this case um or higher chromatin

385
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,720
accessibility in a second but we're

386
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,840
looking here at the profile of the win 3

387
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,600
Gene which as we can see becomes active

388
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,640
late in the development of hair

389
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
follicles down here this bar that's

390
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,480
being showed is gene expression

391
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,240
currently I'll now add one bar on top

392
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,679
where actually the authors of this paper

393
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,120
used the prior approaches to link

394
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,679
regulatory elements to Target genes and

395
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,400
now they're going to show the activity

396
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,039
of those regulatory elements that were

397
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,760
highly correlated to this target Gene

398
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:22,120
went three um throughout development of

399
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,880
the hair follicle so this new bar is

400
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,520
showing the promotor of wi 3 which as we

401
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,080
can see becomes active turns red a bit

402
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,320
before before the gene starts being

403
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,000
expressed which makes sense we need the

404
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,039
promoter to be active in order for all

405
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,919
of the molecular cast of characters to

406
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:45,559
come and express a gene and

407
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:49,039
interestingly um we also see that Peaks

408
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:52,840
that are correlated to Wi 3 which can be

409
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:56,840
thought of as putative uh enhancers each

410
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,240
become active or accessible um at some

411
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,240
point in development prior to went three

412
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,799
being expressed so this example kind of

413
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,320
shows how joint measurements of

414
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,760
chromosone accessibility and gene

415
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,120
expression across single cells can

416
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,600
highlight this concept of chromis

417
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,559
potential or lineage priming in a way

418
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,240
that is very difficult to access using

419
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,240
other types of

420
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,159
data a third application is the

421
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,159
discovery of rare or transient cell

422
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,360
types or States um so this has been a

423
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,240
major area of interest in regulatory

424
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,159
biology as we have sort of discovered

425
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,600
that um regulatory relationships are

426
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,480
very context specific they might be

427
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,320
specific to cell types cell subtypes or

428
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,159
even specific cell States like um a cell

429
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,919
being activated by a certain stimulus we

430
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,440
have become very interested in profiling

431
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,320
these rare cell types um that we might

432
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,000
not even know exist so Dimension

433
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,000
reduction and clustering algorithms

434
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,400
which I'll elaborate a bit more on later

435
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,960
um are used to define cell types and

436
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,760
States from unimodal data very

437
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,039
frequently from single cell RNA seek

438
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,919
data and also from Attack seek data but

439
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,960
applying these methods to multimodal

440
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,000
data increases our biological resolution

441
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,760
and enables joint Dimension reduction so

442
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,760
by using more features um more kind of

443
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,960
unique identifiers of a particular

444
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,559
biological profile um we can get better

445
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,880
resolution on these cell types and

446
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:39,960
states and this can sort of unlock all

447
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,200
of the other applications to be applied

448
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,840
to specific um contexts of Interest

449
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,440
perhaps particularly relevant for

450
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,440
disease or

451
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:55,039
development and a Fourth Kind of

452
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,559
emerging um application of single cell

453
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,240
multi data is using one modality to

454
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:01,240
predict another

455
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,640
um so this example is from a paper that

456
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,360
came out this year uh which is cited a

457
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,600
lot in this presentation they they did a

458
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,559
lot in the paper um where one of their

459
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,120
sort of problem formulations was to

460
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,120
model gene expression as a function of

461
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,520
Cy chromatin accessibility and use those

462
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,159
models to predict gene expression from

463
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,240
chromatin accessibility alone this is

464
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,480
kind of an analytical framework that has

465
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,360
been tried before in the bulk space but

466
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,960
of course with lower resolution and

467
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,039
lower sample size it's challenging so

468
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,720
this paper really um proposed this new

469
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,120
area of inquiry um that is uniquely

470
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,159
enabled by single cell multi data and we

471
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,039
can see how this might actually have an

472
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,600
interesting effect where it can help us

473
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,039
unlock new insights from unimodal data

474
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,480
if we produce highquality multimodal

475
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,159
data we can train models to predict one

476
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,000
modality from another and then get

477
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,919
double the insights from a unimodal

478
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,080
experiment for example if we only did

479
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,840
single cell attack seek and inferred

480
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:12,039
gene expression um from just the Single

481
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:17,480
Cell attack seek so big cost saver um

482
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,480
and and biological Insight increasing

483
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,120
strategy okay so those are just some of

484
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:27,000
the broad types of questions that single

485
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,880
cell multi data has been used to address

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,520
so far um certainly there's many more on

487
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,120
the horizon maybe one of particular

488
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,440
interest to a medical and population

489
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,640
genetics audience is as the number of

490
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,440
data sets expands and even incorporates

491
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,559
a large number of individuals we can

492
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,640
Define very complex um biological

493
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,080
characteristics for genetic Association

494
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,480
studies so for example instead of

495
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,679
measuring the association between a

496
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,360
variant and the expression of Gene a

497
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,279
perhaps we can measure the associ

498
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,960
association of a variant and the

499
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:05,360
correlation between an enhancer and a

500
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,039
gene um is there a particular variant

501
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,559
that sort of unlocks a regulatory

502
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,559
relationship you can imagine a very

503
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,480
multi-layered uh profile of biological

504
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,360
characteristics that you could measure

505
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,600
through genetic Association

506
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:24,080
studies so um for the second section of

507
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,960
the analysis methods um I want to talk

508
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,559
more about some of the technical

509
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,799
challenges in single cell multi data

510
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,480
analysis so anyone kind of developing

511
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,159
methods in this space or even applying

512
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,880
methods in this space single cell data

513
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,799
has unlocked a lot of potential but it's

514
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,760
also unlocked a lot of obstacles that we

515
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,400
need to think through a lot of other

516
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,520
types of data don't really um present us

517
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:53,120
with this so the first sort of challenge

518
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,679
that I will profile is sparsity or noise

519
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,080
in single cell data so the challenge

520
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,200
here is that single cell data is sparse

521
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,720
which means there are many zeros for

522
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,200
example in a single cell uh cell by

523
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,840
feature count Matrix and also noisy just

524
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,520
due to the very small amount of

525
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,200
biological material that's being

526
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,400
measured and the challenge here is that

527
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,440
sparsity and noise is due to both true

528
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,440
biological variation and incomplete

529
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,360
sampling what is sometimes referred to

530
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,919
as

531
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,919
Dropout um where a gene may be truly

532
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,279
expressed for example in a Cell but just

533
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,919
because of their randomness of sampling

534
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,600
um no reads show up in the cell and it's

535
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,679
particularly challenging because we

536
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:41,000
cannot distinguish um the biological

537
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,399
absence of a feature from just the

538
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,640
technical absence of a feature so this

539
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:48,320
is something that's very um very present

540
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,799
on a lot of single cell method

541
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,799
development researchers

542
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,559
minds and the reason this is challenging

543
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,200
is because many traditional linear

544
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:03,039
regression based models assume normality

545
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,360
of the data so um this plot down here

546
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,880
kind of shows what the distribution of

547
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,440
read counts for example for expression

548
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,640
of some Gene might look like there might

549
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,640
be a big peak at zero due to Dropout and

550
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,440
just kind of low profiling of a gene um

551
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,880
and the the frequencies continue to

552
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,679
decrease as we move up in level of read

553
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,360
count so clearly this distribution does

554
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,120
not look normal and so a lot of

555
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,880
traditional analysis methods might fail

556
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,000
when applied to this

557
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,200
data so there's a few different

558
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,840
solutions that are being actively sort

559
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,000
of explored to address this challenge um

560
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,000
first I'll highlight some solutions that

561
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,799
continue to at their core use a normal

562
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,720
model to model single cell data but they

563
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,840
just make some adjustments to the data

564
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,520
to make the data fit the normal model

565
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:01,360
better the first is aggregating single

566
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,000
cells in to meta cells so single cells

567
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,559
provide a tiny amount of biological

568
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,840
material and their measurements are as a

569
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:12,399
result very noisy but um what some

570
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,799
people are doing now is using Dimension

571
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,960
reduction algorithms and clustering

572
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,320
defining what are called meta cells

573
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,600
which are sort of uh low-level

574
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,679
Aggregates of cells so a few cells that

575
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,360
are very close to each other in uh low

576
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,919
dimensional space and are therefore very

577
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,240
biologically similar

578
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,080
we can group them together aggregate

579
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,159
their information and get hopefully sort

580
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,039
of a denoised but still accurate profile

581
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:42,159
of the biology of those cells um so this

582
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:45,080
might look like again grouping a cluster

583
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,799
of cells and simply adding read counts

584
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,880
and we can imagine specifically with

585
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:54,039
respect to the Dropout challenge if each

586
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,880
cell kind of has a a random subset of

587
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,279
molecular features maybe genes that have

588
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,200
dropped out that then hopefully if we

589
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,440
aggregate across different cells we have

590
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,600
some information for all features and

591
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,360
we're less prone to that

592
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:13,679
Dropout so there's a few methods here um

593
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,679
for aggregating single cells into meta

594
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,399
cells another strategy that's been

595
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:23,279
explored is imputing missing Counts from

596
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:28,279
single cell data uh so for example the

597
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,960
magic method um used again this this

598
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:33,880
unique opportunity of having jointly

599
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,120
profiled modalities to predict one

600
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,880
modality from another and impute missing

601
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,039
data to sort of smooth out the the noise

602
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,720
and missingness in this data so very

603
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,880
wellestablished approach in other areas

604
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,279
of biology and can also be applied to

605
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,360
single cell data and again retains the

606
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,760
dimensionality of the data we're still

607
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,360
looking at a single cell level whereas

608
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,559
with meta cells we've reduced the

609
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,799
dimensionality we're now looking at a a

610
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:03,720
lower number of cells I have a question

611
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,679
about that um could you sort of talk

612
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,200
about you've mentioned two solutions

613
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,240
about when would you want to use one

614
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,519
versus the other what are sort of the

615
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,720
limitations yes so I think in terms of

616
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,120
the Technical Solutions to address some

617
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,679
of the challenges in single cell data

618
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,080
interestingly they have not been

619
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,640
rigorously benchmarked against each

620
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,120
other in a lot of cases um a lot of

621
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,559
times many people are developing methods

622
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,320
simultaneously and they will sort of

623
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,159
propose an approach and it's reasonable

624
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,720
it's been used before but we don't

625
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,360
necessarily know uh the specifics of the

626
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,799
approach how they compare to others so I

627
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,200
can't say that I myself am familiar with

628
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,000
sort of a rigorous um comparison of

629
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,760
imputing missing counts versus

630
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,480
aggregating single cells into meta cells

631
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,720
I think this could depend on your

632
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,080
biological question uh could just be a

633
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,120
matter of practicality if you have sumon

634
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,720
analysis procedure that's very

635
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,799
computationally costly and it's

636
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
beneficial to reduce the dimensions of

637
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,760
your data perhaps a good den noising

638
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,519
strategy is to aggregate single cells

639
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,120
into meta cells which will do both of

640
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,679
those things um but I think in general

641
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,200
both of these are kind of accepted

642
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,279
strategies in the field so it really

643
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,799
depends on your particular data set um

644
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,880
your particular question of Interest

645
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,679
another consideration might be just how

646
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,120
specific is the biology you're looking

647
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:31,399
for if you really don't need to look

648
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,320
beyond the level of a cell subtype or a

649
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,960
little cell Village then aggregating

650
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,640
single cells into meta cells might be a

651
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,840
great idea because you're not sort of

652
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,640
introducing new data however if you're

653
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,960
really interested in the biology of

654
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,600
single cells maybe you want to retain

655
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,799
the dimensionality and impute missing

656
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,600
counts instead if you don't mind having

657
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,519
some predicted data in there not just

658
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,440
raw data so those could be a few

659
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:57,440
considerations when thinking of those

660
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,440
two yeah

661
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,360
all right so yet a third approach and

662
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,240
perhaps the most basic maybe the first

663
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,640
approaches that were DED um is

664
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,360
normalizing or transforming um read

665
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,519
counts within single cells just to look

666
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,799
more normal and this figure might not

667
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,440
really uh communicate this but this is

668
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,519
pretty challenging given just the sheer

669
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,799
level of sparsity and noise in single

670
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,720
cell data so sometimes this is not

671
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,720
enough um and the first two approaches

672
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,600
might be better or some combination of

673
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,600
the

674
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,399
three so a second category of solutions

675
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,919
um is using a non-normal model and this

676
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:42,440
is certainly an area that's been

677
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:45,080
explored a lot recently um so discrete

678
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,360
count models like Pon models or negative

679
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,799
binomial models might be a more

680
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,720
appropriate fit for single cell data at

681
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:56,159
the Single Cell resolution um a couple

682
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,080
of methods are highlighted here that use

683
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,159
those approaches

684
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,440
and Beyond just the um vanilla Pon or

685
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,320
negative bionomial

686
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:08,080
models we can also consider zero

687
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,000
inflated models that explicitly account

688
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,159
for the fact that there's going to be a

689
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,440
greater than uh expected amount of zeros

690
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,480
this again is an area of active

691
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:23,279
development and I'm not aware of anyone

692
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,600
who has uh rigorously shown that one

693
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,120
model zero inflated or not zero inflated

694
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,159
is sort of better than the other it's

695
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,600
again the space where a lot of people

696
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,120
have a lot of ideas and they're all

697
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,399
honestly acceptable right now so it

698
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,440
could be a matter of what fits your data

699
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,960
best U and what fits your biological

700
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,960
question

701
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:49,200
best okay so a second sort of half

702
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,480
challenge half feature of the data is

703
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,279
High dimensionality um so as we've been

704
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,919
saying single cell data is highly

705
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,440
dimensional um there is number of

706
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:02,039
features times

707
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,760
number of cells number of data points um

708
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,919
which is vastly larger than bulk

709
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,440
sequencing data sets and while this is a

710
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:10,000
key feature of single cell data in the

711
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,880
sense that it gives us High sample size

712
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,039
and often very high power in a lot of

713
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,480
analyses it also might increase

714
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,120
computational complexity and hinder

715
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,919
interpretability in some other contexts

716
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,240
for example um if we really want to make

717
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,440
inference at the level of cell subtypes

718
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,279
or cell

719
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,000
subpopulations um having a bunch of

720
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,880
single cells might actually kind of

721
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,880
overwhelm us and not not really provide

722
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,240
a lot of easily interpretable

723
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,480
results so this is just demonstrating

724
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,519
how uh the dimensionality of data

725
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,360
increases as we move from bulk to single

726
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:48,519
cell unimodal data and then even further

727
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,960
as we go to single cell multimodal

728
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:54,960
data so some solutions to this um in a

729
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,159
setting where this is viewed as a

730
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,799
problem is uh reducing the number of

731
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,440
features via feature selection so in the

732
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:06,720
RNA space this might look like

733
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,320
restricting only to highly variably

734
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,200
expressed genes in the attack space this

735
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,799
might look like um calling attack Peaks

736
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,000
identifying regions of the genome that

737
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:21,240
are particularly highly active or

738
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,399
defining genomic tiles uh kind of

739
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,159
partitioning The genome into discrete

740
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,440
sections that we going to aggregate

741
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,000
chromatin accessibility across rather

742
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,200
than measuring chromatin accessibility

743
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,200
at the base pair

744
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:41,760
level and a second thing we can do to

745
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,440
reduce um the number of perhaps let just

746
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,200
say number of entries in the data Matrix

747
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,440
is dimension reduction on cells so this

748
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,720
is a very well-known kind of area of

749
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,639
inquiry using PCA or nmf perhaps

750
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,960
combined with some other nonlinear

751
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:04,240
Dimension reduction technique um

752
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,519
to uh reduce the dimensions of the

753
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,560
data or I suppose that also reduces the

754
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,040
features not that okay yes my bad that

755
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,919
also reduces the number of features next

756
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,760
there are strategies you can reduce you

757
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:17,720
can use to reduce the sample size or the

758
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,440
number of units of analysis um and again

759
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,399
I've read it here the strategy of

760
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,440
aggregating single cells into meta cells

761
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,679
um forming those sort of cell clusters

762
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,320
of closely related biological Neighbors

763
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,720
so obviously this is kind of a big

764
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,399
landscape of uh solutions that I've

765
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,320
provided to these two big uh challenges

766
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,159
or features of single cell data and it's

767
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,599
kind of as I said in response to the

768
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:49,200
question uh a unique a uniquely tailored

769
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:52,079
um solution depending on the biological

770
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,960
problem of Interest what uh

771
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,480
dimensionality of data can your analysis

772
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,920
uh withstand and what is going to give

773
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,720
you highest power and greatest

774
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,560
interpretability so these are just kind

775
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,920
of a a menu of solutions available to

776
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,920
people doing single cell data

777
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,800
analysis okay so lastly to kind of bring

778
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,160
together um the broad types of questions

779
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,280
that single cell multi data can answer

780
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,440
with the technical challenges um I'll

781
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:31,000
highlight a particular area of inquiry

782
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:33,000
linking enhancers to genes um to sort of

783
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,520
highlight the unique uh benefits of

784
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,560
single cell multi data so I'm sure I

785
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,200
don't have to convince any of you that

786
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,880
mapping Gene regulatory architectures is

787
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,079
critical to understanding disease um the

788
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,000
vast majority of disease Associated

789
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,839
variants in gwas are non-coding and

790
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,760
these variants often do not regulate the

791
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,040
nearest Gene so linking regulatory

792
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,240
variants to their target genes is a

793
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,400
critical step in interpreting gwas

794
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,680
discoveries and nominating potential

795
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,920
drug

796
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,960
targets and historically regulatory

797
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,520
activity relationships between enhancers

798
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,480
and genes have been interrogated using

799
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,880
various lines of biological evidence um

800
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,440
most recently or one of the the newer

801
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,599
developments on the scene is of course

802
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,880
single cell molecular profiling um

803
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,280
specifically single cell multimodal

804
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,680
profiling and compared to some of these

805
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,960
other methods single cell multi data is

806
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,599
is context specific so information we

807
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,280
might get from DNA sequence or

808
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,880
conservation um predictions really

809
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,040
doesn't tell us any information that's

810
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,319
specific to biological context and as I

811
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,800
said we know that regulatory biology is

812
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,280
very context specific so that's a point

813
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,560
for single cell multi data

814
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,920
here single cell multi data is also

815
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:58,400
closer to causality than some genomewide

816
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,760
biochemical assays for example

817
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,000
um 3D confirmation mapping and

818
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,400
biochemical annotations like DNA

819
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,640
methylation or hisone marks these

820
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,960
provide genomewide kind of predictions

821
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:14,040
and proxies of regulatory activity but

822
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,880
they don't really um hint at causal

823
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,800
relationships and sometimes they don't

824
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,160
even implicate a Target Gene for a

825
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,960
candidate enhancer whereas the

826
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,160
correlation between an enhancer in a

827
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,720
gene is a closer proxy for biological

828
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,880
causality single cell multi data is

829
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,079
easier to collect um so relative to

830
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,359
something like eqtl where we need to

831
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,480
collect um hundreds or thousands of bulk

832
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,160
sequencing samples to run a genetic

833
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,880
Association study and identify

834
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,560
relationships between regulatory regions

835
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,640
and for example gene expression um

836
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,160
single cell multi data we can often

837
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:57,520
derive a lot of biological insights from

838
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,520
a single sample from a single donor even

839
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,640
single cell multi data is also

840
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:05,720
genomewide and convenient so relative to

841
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,720
more targeted experimental approaches

842
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,960
that often um seek to address a specific

843
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,720
biological hypothesis about one gene or

844
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,560
one enhancer um single cell multi data

845
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:19,079
provides genomewide predictions um and

846
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,359
is not nearly as experimentally

847
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:26,640
burdensome as profiling many genes uh

848
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:26,640
through a crisper screen for example

849
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,040
so as I uh briefly highlighted before

850
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,040
single cell multi data has been used to

851
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,760
link regulatory elements to their target

852
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,920
genes by measuring the correlation

853
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,400
between the accessibility of a region of

854
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,000
Chromatin a candidate enhancer and the

855
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,720
expression of a candidate Target Gene

856
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,079
and if we repeat these pairwise tests

857
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,160
for all enhancer Gene pairs um we can

858
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,960
sort of predict or map regulatory

859
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,960
biology genomewide using uh a single

860
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,400
sample and so in this table I've

861
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,000
highlighted a few specific analysis

862
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,160
methods just to demonstrate how

863
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,560
different strategies are being employed

864
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,359
to um address the challenges that we

865
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:20,400
discussed in the previous section so for

866
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:23,680
example the scent and Scar link methods

867
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,920
for linking enhancers to genes um

868
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,920
perform analyses at the level of a

869
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,000
single cell but to address the

870
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,119
non-normality in the data they both

871
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,520
employ pan regression instead of

872
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:38,079
measuring linear correlation or using

873
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,760
linear regression a third method the syc

874
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,920
peak Gene linking method also uh

875
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,839
performs analysis at the level of single

876
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,079
cells and does measure linear

877
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,520
correlations but performs uh specific

878
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,119
normalization steps to make the data

879
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,040
look as normal as possible and make the

880
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,760
correlation readouts as meaningful as

881
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,440
possible

882
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,760
a fourth method the Archer method

883
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,160
measures simple linear correlation which

884
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,800
assumes normality of the data but

885
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,640
importantly it Aggregates single cells

886
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,680
into meta cells using a joint

887
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,079
dimensionality reduction prior to

888
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,079
measuring

889
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,720
correlation all right so this is just

890
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,800
again a specific example of how these

891
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,319
different challenges um and

892
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,560
opportunities from single cell um can be

893
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:35,119
combin to to uh design strategies to

894
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,160
learn about context specific biology so

895
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,920
a few

896
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,599
conclusions um single cell multi

897
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,160
Technologies jointly profile multiple

898
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,200
biological modalities while retaining

899
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,839
cellular heterogeneity this is kind of

900
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:54,000
the key benefit of single cell multi

901
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,560
data single cell multi analyses can

902
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,520
Target diverse biological questions some

903
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,440
of which I've highlighted here but many

904
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,880
of which will be unlocked in the coming

905
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,800
years as more data is

906
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,119
generated single cell multi methods use

907
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,200
various strategies to handle data

908
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,920
sparsity or noise and high

909
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,920
dimensionality in single cell

910
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,079
data and finally we took a somewhat

911
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,400
closer look at several computational

912
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,760
methods that use single cell RNA and

913
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,599
attack multi data to link regulatory

914
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,560
elements to their target gen

915
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,839
so one final Point um a bit of a a

916
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,960
forecast is that these multi

917
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:39,720
Technologies and Analysis methods are

918
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,040
rapidly developing um so for example uh

919
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,680
we highlighted kind of the dominant

920
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,839
technology today which is RNA plus

921
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,280
attack data but another technology that

922
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,720
jointly profiles uh RNA gene expression

923
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,240
and cell surface protein is also kind of

924
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,839
rising in popularity and we can imagine

925
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,280
how that would unlock

926
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,640
unique uh insights as well some overlap

927
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,680
with the applications of RNA plus attack

928
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,880
but some new biological questions and

929
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,079
there are even emerging technologies

930
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,800
that measure three modalities at the

931
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,760
same time for example gene expression

932
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,560
chromatin accessibility and DNA

933
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,960
methylation or gene expression chromatin

934
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,280
accessibility and intranuclear proteins

935
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,520
so we can imagine the number of

936
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,000
biological questions just multiplies as

937
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,200
we can combine

938
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,839
multiple modalities within the same

939
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:37,119
analysis unit same single cell um and

940
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,720
the vast array of the technologies that

941
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,040
are available are reviewed thoroughly in

942
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,079
this review that I've highlighted here

943
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,720
vanderen at all 2023 nature reviews

944
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,400
genetics all right so that is all I had

945
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,599
for today I'm happy to take any

946
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,599
questions thank you very much

947
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,280
thanks and if you guys have questions

948
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,240
just come up to the microphones and why

949
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
we wait for them I'm wondering if you

950
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,680
could touch on quality control is it as

951
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,720
simple as doing each modality separate

952
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,960
and are some things that you consider

953
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,720
jointly good question so quality control

954
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,319
um is because of the sparcity of noise

955
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,800
and single cell data a huge

956
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:22,599
consideration um there are sort of

957
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,920
separate quality control s of

958
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,440
established quality control U procedures

959
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,800
for RNA seek data and attack SE data at

960
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,559
the Single Cell level and uh multimodal

961
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,319
quality control is pretty much just the

962
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,280
intersection of those two um which is

963
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:43,319
challenging in the sense that if you

964
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:46,240
think of uh a subset of your large

965
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:49,440
single cell sample being of high quality

966
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,760
with respect to RNA and a subset of that

967
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,480
data also being high quality with

968
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,760
respect to attack sometimes those will

969
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,400
be correlated and sometimes they will

970
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,200
not so finding the intersection high

971
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,040
quality cells uh for both modalities is

972
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,800
often a challenge and often results in

973
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,680
somewhat smaller data sets uh fewer

974
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,480
cells than one modality alone but it's

975
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,280
mostly just a function of um performing

976
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,119
both types of

977
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,880
QC are there any methods that um maybe

978
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,640
if a cell in the RNA seek is like

979
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,119
borderline and then you look in the

980
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,800
attack seek and it looks great then you

981
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,640
might be like keep it or something

982
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,800
attacks like does that exist that's a

983
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,040
good question

984
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,359
I

985
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,480
so to my knowledge it's pretty much user

986
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,440
controlled when you perform your QC you

987
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,839
can sort of decide what your cut offs

988
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,720
are going to be for the number of reads

989
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:45,319
of attack per cell and things of that

990
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,359
nature so I would imagine there is a way

991
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:52,800
to sort of ad hoc um Define some quality

992
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,119
score per cell per modality and and cut

993
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,599
off at like a product of quality scores

994
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,760
between the two um mod alties or

995
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,760
something like that yeah that would

996
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,559
probably be a good strategy to increase

997
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,559
the ultimate dimensionality of the

998
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,520
data while the audience um is gathering

999
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:14,880
their questions um where do you if

1000
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,839
someone is new to single cell on Multi

1001
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,280
data where's a great place to look for

1002
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:24,720
um data sets to get their hands wet

1003
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,200
that's a great question so um 10x

1004
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,680
genomics has several multi-owned data

1005
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,760
sets that are publicly available that

1006
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,480
are a good place to start um they're

1007
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:37,000
often already processed already in kind

1008
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,520
of feature matrices for you um and a lot

1009
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,280
of papers are coming out these days

1010
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,599
where they have generated single cell

1011
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,200
multi data sets in specific biological

1012
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,040
contexts of interest um or using a new

1013
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,079
technology and they will often also

1014
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,119
release their data so I would say 10x

1015
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,800
genomics is a great place to look and

1016
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:59,599
also just kind of um keyword searching

1017
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,559
single cell multi data in um your

1018
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,720
Journal of choice maybe the the nature

1019
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:06,720
journals family or something like that

1020
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,960
um and you can often find some good good

1021
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,000
data sets that way and often sorry um

1022
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,280
before you ask your question um I would

1023
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,480
say another recommendation is any paper

1024
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,280
that is proposing a single cell data

1025
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,640
analysis method really for any uh part

1026
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,920
of the process whether it's kind of a

1027
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,599
data processing method or Downstream

1028
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,200
kind of biological question you can also

1029
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:29,720
look at the the data sets they have used

1030
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,839
because often times those authors have

1031
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,280
gone through the process of picking out

1032
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,359
these uh data sets from corners of the

1033
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,720
scientific world to to analyze so those

1034
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:41,680
would be my three

1035
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:44,400
recommendations um if you have different

1036
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,839
modes of measurement or like different

1037
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,880
modalities can you use the same software

1038
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:51,400
to do this the analysis like as long as

1039
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,960
you have some sort of cell by feature

1040
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,559
Matrix can you process everything the

1041
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:00,000
same way good question so it really

1042
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:03,160
depends and I think the answer is

1043
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,800
there's not currently kind of a unified

1044
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,200
approach that everyone in the Single

1045
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,400
Cell world is using to process their

1046
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,559
data um because the data the technology

1047
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,359
is just so new everyone's kind of doing

1048
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,480
their own thing to some extent um the

1049
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,040
key kind of consideration to keep in

1050
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,480
mind is the difference differences

1051
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,280
between RN SE data and a tax seat data

1052
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,040
they are similar in the sense that

1053
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,599
you're getting kind of read counts for

1054
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,720
both um I would say the main difference

1055
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,240
is a taxi data is much higher

1056
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,160
dimensional and each molecular feature

1057
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:38,040
is going to have higher variance and not

1058
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,680
be as well profiled so with that

1059
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,000
principle in mind there will be probably

1060
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:48,280
some differences in how you process the

1061
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:51,040
data um but usually the same software

1062
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,680
can be used for both um so for example

1063
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,559
sirat and syc are kind of major

1064
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,720
softwares in R also Archer is a big

1065
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:03,119
softare Ware more tailored to single

1066
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:05,280
cell attack seek um but also developing

1067
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,079
applications for integrating RNA seek as

1068
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,599
well sort of in multimodal um data but

1069
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,680
typically I think you should aim to use

1070
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,000
the same software package um and then

1071
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,760
integrate them using that software

1072
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,440
package usually they have that that

1073
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,559
functionality that's a good question

1074
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,599
thanks so much for your talk I one of

1075
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,400
the really subtle things you mentioned

1076
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,200
was the opportunity to look at the

1077
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,119
impact of Gene variance on the car

1078
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,040
between enhancers and gene expression

1079
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,400
can you say any more about how people do

1080
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,160
that and the challenges of doing that

1081
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,280
and the challenges of having enough data

1082
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,280
to do that

1083
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,240
yes or a description of How It's been

1084
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:53,559
done that was kind of just invented in

1085
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,799
my mind um I think for unimodal single

1086
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,680
cell data this is obviously an area of

1087
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:59,839
hugely expanding interest U measuring

1088
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,000
the association between genetic

1089
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,240
variation and chromatin accessibility at

1090
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,160
a known enhancer or methylation at a

1091
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,200
known site or something like that um so

1092
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:14,359
I think as we combine biological

1093
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:16,440
modalities together the space of

1094
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:18,960
possible phenotypes that we can measure

1095
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,960
genetic associations with just expands

1096
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,040
and as you said the big challenge with

1097
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,920
this is are we ever going to have data

1098
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,079
sets where we have hundreds or thousands

1099
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,079
of individuals with genetic data and

1100
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,520
multi data because multi data at the

1101
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,720
moment is quite costly and burdensome to

1102
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,400
produce um so some of them are well

1103
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,480
established lines of inquiry really only

1104
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,319
rely on data from a single sample like

1105
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,480
linking enhancers to genes if we got to

1106
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,079
a place where we had some atlas of

1107
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,760
hundreds of individuals with genetic

1108
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:53,119
variation and multimodal um measurements

1109
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,480
I think it would be incredibly powerful

1110
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,359
to be able to perform Association

1111
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,240
studies on very complex phenotypes like

1112
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,520
that

1113
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,440
um the specific example you highlighted

1114
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:07,359
in my mind perhaps it could reveal some

1115
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,640
sort of context specificity or stimulus

1116
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,839
dependence of a regulatory relationship

1117
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,880
for example if people with a certain

1118
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:16,640
variant exhibit a strong correlation

1119
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,920
between an enhancer and a gene and

1120
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,559
people with the uh alternate all do

1121
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,480
not what does that say about the

1122
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,119
function of that variant do we know that

1123
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,359
it is in a transcription Factor binding

1124
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,839
or an an enhancer for another Gene

1125
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,799
that's closely related like what what

1126
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,760
information might that give us about the

1127
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:37,720
interactions between these different

1128
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,760
biological processes so that was just

1129
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:43,680
kind of off the cuff um I wish I had had

1130
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,839
a a specific study to site but maybe in

1131
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,839
the future
