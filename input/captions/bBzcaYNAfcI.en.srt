1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,440
So today is the last day of our unit

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,080
about random walks on groups and um the

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,960
main the goal of the day is to digest

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,000
think about the banan gamber theorem

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,080
about mixing on SL2FP

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,480
um so we stated it at the end of last

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,279
time first I'll Remember, remind

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,279
everybody what it says.

9
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:06,080
Okay. So it's about mixing on SL2FP.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,080
So it says if mu is a probability

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,080
measure

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
SL2F

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
actually maybe we it doesn't matter that

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,640
much but maybe we said it in ter in

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,640
terms of subsets.

16
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,960
Okay. So the question is when when does

17
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,040
the random walk coming from a u mix? So

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,799
um

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,119
um so then the conclusion will be

20
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,439
the singular value of this walk is less

21
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,520
than 1 minus c of epsilon meaning that

22
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,520
it does mix.

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
Okay. Um

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,399
so and um to see that this happens we

25
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,320
need to know that a doesn't lie in any

26
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,720
subgroup. And so we have a hypothesis

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
that's related to that. It says that for

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,719
any

29
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:04,640
borell subgroup B

30
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:09,640
um A intersect

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,640
GB. So any G in our group

32
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,560
and this guy is bounded by K of epsilon

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,440
P the minus epsilon* A. So only a small

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,239
fraction of A lies in any co-et of a

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,520
burell group.

36
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,599
Okay. Um, and we'll put in parenthesis

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,599
that a is symmetric. We don't really

38
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,519
need it, but it also doesn't matter that

39
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,120
much. And, uh, it will make things a

40
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,840
little cleaner.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
>> Yeah.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,680
>> Question about the difference between

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,680
hey, is a sub or a subset versus a

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,080
measure. Is it possible to kind of pass

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,319
between the two cases by just waiting by

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
different subgroup sets?

47
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,040
>> Yeah, that's right. So the question was

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
what's the difference between taking a

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,800
subset or taking a measure? I think

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,480
there's not that much difference. I

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,480
think if you can use this as a black box

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,000
and prove things about measures, I think

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,440
we also could just use measures through

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,400
the whole proof and it would work fine.

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Okay. So this proof breaks into the

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
proof of this theorem breaks into two

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,720
important pieces which are both

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,239
interesting and which are both connected

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,230
in different ways to themes of our

60
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,389
class.

61
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,389
[Applause]

62
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,239
Okay,

63
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,920
so the first part says that if if you

64
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,400
just have any pretty much any set and

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,440
you do this random walk, the only way it

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,680
can fail to mix if is if it gets stuck

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,239
in something which is sort of

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,159
approximately a subgroup.

69
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,760
So, so it can fail to mix if it's

70
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,440
literally contained in a subgroup. And a

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,680
little bit more generally, it can it can

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,000
only fail to mix if there's a set which

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,799
is a lot like a subgroup which contains

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,840
a lot of the mass of the measure. Okay,

75
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,840
so let's try to write this down.

76
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,519
Um,

77
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,080
so this is probably true for any group.

78
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm going to write it for SL2FP for now

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,360
and then as we talk about it more let's

80
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,360
keep our eyes open of what we actually

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
used

82
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,160
symmetric

83
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
um

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:29,160
and

85
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,160
sigma one ta it's bigger than 1 minus

86
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,919
here I'll put

87
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,919
1 - epsilon Um then

88
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,880
there exists uh some kind of approximate

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,880
subgroup called H

90
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
um

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,840
yeah hold let me adjust a little bit.

92
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:03,759
Let me also say that a is pretty big

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,240
and is not not too tiny. Um then there

94
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,400
exists some H.

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:15,080
Um so that mu tensored to some power of

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,080
H is pretty big

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,639
and this H is sort of like a subgroup in

98
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,639
the following sense.

99
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,759
So h if you multiply it by itself many

100
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,120
times for example five you could do more

101
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:42,759
um this is less than p to the o of delta

102
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,759
* h and h also is not too big.

103
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
Okay so if you had another group you

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
would have to adjust these things but I

105
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,520
think that that that's sort of minor I

106
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,479
think that's all you would have to

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,960
change.

108
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,639
Okay. So if you have a set which is a

109
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,120
decent sized fraction of our group and

110
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,520
let's say it's symmetric

111
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,800
um then either that random walks mixes

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,160
or there is some subset which is sort of

113
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,560
like a group and

114
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,479
when you take K steps of your random

115
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,960
walk you have a high probability of

116
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,520
being in this set.

117
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,240
Um and this set is sort of like a group

118
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,240
in in this sense.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Okay.

120
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,720
All right. And so there's delta and

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,280
epsilon. Maybe at the beginning I should

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,440
say this and delta depends on epsilon.

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,440
That's possible.

124
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,240
All right. Any questions or comments

125
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,440
about theorem one? It's theorem one is

126
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,440
is gamber essentially.

127
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,919
>> Yeah.

128
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:27,280
>> Where does the two

129
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,800
>> Yeah. So um

130
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,199
um

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,800
what's significant here is just that

132
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:43,319
this is is less significantly smaller

133
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:43,319
than the whole group. Um and if we

134
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,680
yeah

135
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,720
>> like power group less than one or like

136
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,720
little of the group

137
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:02,319
>> um right right yeah okay so so this

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,599
comes last time from this um uh

139
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
so actually it's also important that

140
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,879
this is bigger than two so we had this

141
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,599
um important property of SL2FP

142
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,800
that it's um uh that it it's um ah yeah

143
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,840
so this actually this wouldn't work for

144
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
any group. So we have this important

145
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,400
property for SL2FP from last time that

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,639
every non-trivial representation has a

147
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,599
large dimension and that had the

148
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,080
property that if you got if this thing

149
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,479
had a small L2 norm so it was like kind

150
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,320
of decently well mixed then we would get

151
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,000
a spectral gap and then if you kept

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,120
going it would become really really well

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,719
mixed and that's crucially being used

154
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:45,200
here. Um, and so here you could put

155
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,519
anything bigger than two. Um, and the

156
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,600
the point is that it can only go wrong

157
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,760
by getting stuck in something of size

158
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,279
really smaller than P squed because we

159
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,880
know once it spread over something of

160
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,279
size bigger than P^ squ then it's going

161
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,440
to keep going and spread all the way.

162
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,440
Yeah. Thanks.

163
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Yeah.

164
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
Okay. Well, this theorem raises a

165
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,399
question. um who are all the subsets H

166
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,480
that are like this it becomes a much

167
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,040
nicer theorem when we can write them all

168
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,080
down and um or at least say something

169
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,200
meaningful about them. Okay, so theorem

170
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,200
two says something about that.

171
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,839
So this theorem is due to healthcott

172
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,839
and it builds on

173
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,839
rushski.

174
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,160
Okay. So it says if h is a subset of

175
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,560
sl2fp

176
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,600
um

177
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,600
and it has these two properties.

178
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,120
So all of this stuff is smaller than p

179
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:02,480
to the delta h.

180
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,160
Um and h is at least p to the epsilon.

181
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
You can kind of read that off from here.

182
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,800
It's not going to get stuck in something

183
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,040
smaller than a um and at most p to the

184
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,839
2.5.

185
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,920
Then the conclusion is that h is

186
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,680
concentrated in a burell subgroup or

187
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,399
burell coet. So then there exists

188
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,800
a burell subgroup

189
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:30,720
B with an element G in our group. Um so

190
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,640
that H intersect B is bigger than some

191
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,760
small constant times H.

192
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,480
So our approximate subgroups basically

193
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,480
have to sit in a burell subgroup. This

194
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,959
isn't a complete classification because

195
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,880
some of the subsets of B are approximate

196
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,320
subgroups and many of them aren't. Um

197
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,320
but it's a meaningful piece of

198
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
information.

199
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,760
Okay, cool. So um you you put these two

200
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,160
theorems together, you can prove that

201
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,959
theorem pretty quickly.

202
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,160
>> Yeah.

203
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,760
>> Um if this C does it depend on anything

204
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,640
or is it universe?

205
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,480
>> Does it depend on anything? Let's put

206
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,720
this here. Um

207
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,720
let's see. I have all these epsilons and

208
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,720
deltas.

209
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,160
don't think it depends on anything. So I

210
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,320
guess here there should be

211
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
this

212
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
we can do this. So this is getting

213
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,160
stronger as epsilon's getting smaller.

214
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,800
Epsilon's telling us that our thing is

215
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,360
not too small. Um and uh and then I

216
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,120
think that this is just a constant.

217
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
Um I guess that does suggest that we

218
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,640
could have said something stronger up

219
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
there.

220
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,079
Yeah,

221
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,519
this is definitely H, not B.

222
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,800
>> I think it's right.

223
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,399
>> Yeah.

224
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,440
>> Um, this is a question about kind of the

225
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,000
choice of G. If point H is a symmetric

226
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,160
subset, would that kind of imply that

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
the sort of optimal G is always going to

228
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,000
just be the identity because you think

229
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,200
of H as kind of being centered in some

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,240
way around the identity. So shifting a

231
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,160
subgroup by by kind of non identity

232
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,279
element wouldn't change the

233
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,399
intersection.

234
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,160
>> Yeah. So the question is if maybe if H

235
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,519
were itself symmetric which in fact I

236
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,120
think will happen in this setup um then

237
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,680
maybe you don't need this G and maybe

238
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,760
it's actually only actual subgroups. Um

239
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:47,399
I think that may be so let me just

240
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,399
describe that I'm not sure we need G.

241
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Um,

242
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,880
correct. Yeah. So, so a good example to

243
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,320
think about is if you just take a co-et

244
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,000
of a burell subgroup and in the aelion

245
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,560
world a co-et of a subgroup will be very

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,200
small when you add it to itself.

247
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,720
But in the nonabelian world it's not so

248
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,040
clear.

249
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,720
So I'll make a remark

250
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:40,480
if H is a co-et of a group then um how

251
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,399
big is just H * H? Well it's G * B * G *

252
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,639
B.

253
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
And because it's not commutative I can't

254
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,000
bring this across.

255
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,440
So it's not obvious that this is small.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,440
So I I think this is in fact large.

257
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,560
So based on that, I think it's likely

258
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,480
that we don't need this. Um but it made

259
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,480
the proof it makes the proof a little

260
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
shorter.

261
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,160
Okay, cool. Okay, so I have a couple of

262
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,519
big picture comments about this. Um one

263
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,839
comment is um let's compare to the

264
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,399
perhaps simpler setting of an aelion

265
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
group. So we maybe have the group of the

266
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
integers or the group of the integers

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,360
modulo P. Suppose we had a subset in

268
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,240
there that had this property

269
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,800
and this property. So when you add it to

270
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,560
itself many times it expands but only by

271
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,360
a little bit by a small power of the

272
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,120
size of the set. Then what can we say

273
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,959
about the structure of such things?

274
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,560
That's a big open problem in additive

275
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,360
combinatorics.

276
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,600
Um that's the sort of friend and rouia

277
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,279
problem. If you have something even

278
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,800
smaller here like log p or or so um then

279
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,399
there would be a classification that

280
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,000
would have to look like a generalized

281
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,560
arithmetic progression. But in this

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
range there's there's not a whole lot

283
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,440
there's nothing like a structure theorem

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,680
that currently exists in this range. So

285
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,519
in a certain sense it's this is stronger

286
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,760
information in the non-commutive world

287
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,120
than we have in the commutive world. Of

288
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
course you might point out that this is

289
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,199
not a complete structure theorem either.

290
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,320
Um but this is a really strong piece of

291
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,160
information about our group and I think

292
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,120
in some ways it's stronger than any what

293
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,600
we know in the community world.

294
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,920
Yeah. Um another comment so I'm not

295
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,199
sure. So so Rashki and Hut both worked

296
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,240
on this. Rashowski came from logic and I

297
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,920
think that he was interested in the idea

298
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,720
from the point of view of logic of like

299
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,560
an approximate subgroup. You know like a

300
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,199
a basic thing we have axioms for is that

301
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,519
you know axims for a group and what

302
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,519
happens if you uh relax those axioms a

303
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
little bit. What can you say? So

304
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,959
interesting question from the point of

305
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,959
view of logic.

306
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,560
Okay cool. Uh all right. So the goal for

307
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,279
the class is to discuss each of these

308
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,720
things in moderate depth probably

309
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,920
without giving complete proofs. Um

310
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,759
uh and and they're they have quite

311
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,440
different ideas but in both cases the

312
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
ideas are related to stuff in in our

313
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,600
class.

314
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,120
Okay. So first let's talk about theorem

315
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,120
one.

316
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Um

317
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,399
so on the board

318
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:38,519
okay so we start with the measure mu

319
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,519
which is mu aa and we notice that mu l2

320
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,040
is one over the size of a. So that's

321
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,120
like is at most p to the minus epsilon

322
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,440
because it was it was built into our

323
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,240
assumptions here that a is is at least p

324
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,560
the epsilon. Okay. Now let's start

325
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,240
convolving mu with itself and we want to

326
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,199
see if we convolve it with itself enough

327
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:03,279
times um is what will happen to the L2

328
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:06,160
norm. So let's say mu2

329
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,679
so that's let's call this mu1. Mu2 is

330
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,120
mu1 convolved with mu1 and in general mu

331
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,640
k + 1 is mu k convolved with mu k. So

332
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,079
we're convolving with this thing with

333
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,199
itself many times and we're going to see

334
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,199
what happens to the L2 norm. Okay. So

335
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,720
recall

336
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:30,320
um that if at some point mu k l2^2 were

337
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:35,360
to be smaller than 1 over p the 2.1

338
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:42,840
then we would get um that sigma 1 of t

339
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,840
mu k was bounded by well bounded by

340
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,880
okay and then we would get that sigma 1

341
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,400
of t mu

342
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:56,320
So mu k is mu convolved with itself 2

343
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,160
the k times. So that would be um p the

344
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,880
minus1 / 10 * 2 the k. So if k is not

345
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,200
too big we would get a spectral bank. So

346
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,039
that's our plan.

347
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,559
Okay. So we keep doing these

348
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,120
convolutions and we watch what happens

349
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,000
to the L2 norm. And at every step maybe

350
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,120
the L2 norm goes down significantly. In

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,640
that case we're happy. or maybe it

352
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,120
doesn't go down. In that case, we're

353
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,120
stuck. And the stuck situation, we'll

354
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,919
try to analyze it carefully and see that

355
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,039
the stuck situation only arises because

356
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,000
of this situ this structure, this setup.

357
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,840
So, let me write that out.

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,600
So, let's say G stands for our goal,

359
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,760
which is that mu k

360
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,240
L2 is less than 1 over P 2.1. If we get

361
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,880
there, we're happy. P will stand for

362
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,160
progress.

363
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,320
We're not necessarily there, but mu k +

364
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,840
one l2^ 2 is bounded by p the minus

365
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,480
delta

366
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,480
mu k l2.

367
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay.

368
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,960
And then s stands for stuck which means

369
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,360
we are not at our goal and we are not

370
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,400
making progress.

371
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,400
not goal and not progress.

372
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,039
Okay,

373
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,160
cool.

374
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,799
Okay, so as long as we don't get stuck,

375
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
we will reach our goal in about one over

376
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
delta steps.

377
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,360
So

378
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,360
if s never happens

379
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,559
we reach the goal

380
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,559
and less than one over delta steps and

381
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,039
no matter what delta is delta is just a

382
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,760
large constant and that still that is

383
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,440
enough to to to give the conclusion. So

384
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,919
then if you if you do a little

385
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,080
calculation using this you'll you'll get

386
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,080
a spectrum.

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,320
Okay. So suppose we do get stuck. Let's

388
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,320
think about what that means.

389
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,520
Okay. So, there was a comment at the

390
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
beginning of the class that perhaps

391
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
there's not a big difference between a

392
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,039
set and a measure because if you have a

393
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,880
set, you can turn it into a measure. If

394
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,200
you have a measure, you can look at the

395
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,000
points that where the measure is pretty

396
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,880
big and you get a set. Um, and that's

397
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,440
actually what we're going to do.

398
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:56,400
So um let's say that a lambda of mu k is

399
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,000
the set of group elements for our group

400
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,799
sl2fp

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,360
where mu k of g is approximately lambda.

402
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,840
Okay so we can decompose our group into

403
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,919
pieces where muk has various sizes and

404
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,760
one of these sizes must have a decent

405
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:20,400
fraction of the measure. So we choose

406
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:23,280
lambda so that muk k of a lambda

407
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,039
is around one.

408
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,280
So we've we've cut our whole group into

409
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,120
maybe logarithmically many pieces. They

410
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,440
their total measure is one. So one of

411
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,799
them has to be pretty big. All right.

412
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:38,039
And now let's say a k is defined to be

413
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,039
this set.

414
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,960
Right. So what we've learned is that mu

415
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,400
k is roughly uniform on ak and ak has a

416
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,480
good fraction of the total measure of

417
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,559
mu.

418
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,360
Okay, great.

419
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:57,039
Um

420
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,120
okay so more or less you could imagine

421
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,720
that mu k is just the uniform measure on

422
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,120
ak. Um all right so now what would we

423
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,520
learn algebraically about ak from the

424
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,799
fact that we are stuck?

425
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,559
um that actually has a nice

426
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,799
interpretation in terms of a previous

427
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,840
character in our course which was the

428
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,440
idea of energy. So let's recall what

429
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,520
what energy means and put it in a

430
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,520
non-commutative context and we'll see

431
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,520
that it sort of exactly fits here.

432
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,280
Okay. So let's say

433
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:37,039
that so if we have two subsets

434
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:39,840
A and B in our group the energy of AB

435
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:44,559
is the number of

436
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,960
uh A1 A2 B1 B2 these guys are in A and

437
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:54,200
these guys are in B.

438
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,200
So that a1 * b1 is the same as a2 * b2

439
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,000
energy a. Now we this is the same

440
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,400
definition that we saw before in the

441
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,039
context of a commutive group. A group is

442
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,799
now not commutive which means that it

443
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,000
matters what order I wrote those things

444
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,320
in. And so it matters what order I wrote

445
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,799
those things in. So eab is not actually

446
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,320
the same as eba.

447
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:24,280
Okay. But it's otherwise it's a very

448
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,280
similar looking definition. Um and um

449
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,440
um okay and and we can relate this to

450
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,320
what to what to to this setup. We can

451
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,480
notice that EAB

452
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,400
is I take the characteristic function of

453
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
A and I convolve it with the

454
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,360
characteristic function of B. When I do

455
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
that, if I evaluate this at G, it will

456
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,080
tell me how many ways are there to write

457
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,159
G as little A times little B.

458
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,799
Now I'm going to square it because I

459
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,480
want to how many ways and that many

460
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,799
choices for this and that many choices

461
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,799
for that and sum over B. So this is

462
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,799
this.

463
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay. So notice um I took something I

464
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,760
convolved it by something else and I

465
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,880
took its L2 norm that's the character

466
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,880
that's involved in being stuck.

467
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,640
So something we can say

468
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,000
um okay actually so before before we do

469
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,200
that let me make a little normalization

470
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,200
um so remark

471
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:46,400
E A A is in between A cubed and A squ

472
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,400
right. So the A squared comes from I

473
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,080
could take these to be equal and I could

474
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,400
take those to be equal and a cubed upper

475
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,200
bound comes from once I've chosen these

476
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,600
three there's at most one choice for the

477
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,279
last one. Okay. So the these ones are

478
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,840
have a lot of additive structure and the

479
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,760
typical example is an actual subgroup

480
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,240
and these have very little additive

481
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,279
structure.

482
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,360
Okay. Um so now let's relate to being

483
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,360
stuck.

484
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,799
So if we are in the stuck case for ak

485
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:27,039
for mu k

486
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:30,039
and we could see um

487
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,039
this

488
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,559
um

489
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,679
okay so mu k is essentially 1 over a k

490
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,679
this characteristic function of a k and

491
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,400
if we want to be rigorous I guess we say

492
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:53,200
something like this.

493
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:58,000
And um if we say mu k convolved with mu

494
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,480
k is smaller than is larger than p the

495
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,799
minus delta

496
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,799
mu k.

497
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,720
This is equivalent to saying that the

498
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,799
energy a k with a k is smaller than some

499
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,760
p to the delta

500
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,760
time a k cubed

501
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,520
claim. If we unwind this we'll get this.

502
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,039
So we unwind this we'll see an energy

503
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,360
the energy of AK and this you know this

504
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,640
is almost the minimum possible value of

505
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,520
the L2 norm and so it's almost the um

506
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,360
sorry it's almost the

507
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,960
this goes the other way. So the the um

508
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,440
there let me say that again. So this is

509
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,080
encoding this energy. It's a lower bound

510
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,360
for it and the lower bound is almost um

511
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,080
the biggest it could be. So this energy

512
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,799
is almost the biggest it could be. Yes.

513
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,679
>> That be ak

514
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,799
lower bound for energy.

515
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,320
>> Uh right. No. So no it's ak cubed and

516
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,679
this is a minus sign. So this is

517
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,200
possible. Yeah.

518
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,000
>> Okay. So this just got copied there. And

519
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
um uh all right. So okay. So if you look

520
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,600
at this L2 norm, these are probability

521
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,679
measures. So this L2 norm is at most

522
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
that L2 norm.

523
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,640
So when you look at this inequality,

524
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,679
this L2 norm is really pinched.

525
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,080
It's at least a small fraction. It's at

526
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,159
least a large fraction of mu2 and it's

527
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,919
at most mu2.

528
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,159
So it's just about as big as it could

529
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,640
be. So this energy is just about as big

530
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,640
as it could be.

531
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,559
Okay, cool.

532
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:53,039
All right. So if we get stuck there must

533
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:56,480
be a subset of very high energy

534
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,320
and that is

535
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,640
step towards being an approximate

536
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,000
subgroup but it's not as strong as the

537
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,480
conclusion of theorem one.

538
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,320
Um okay so at this point the story

539
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,360
connects to some characters that we

540
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,159
talked about when we were doing

541
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,559
projection theory over finite fields. um

542
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,440
it relates to the balag summary gow

543
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,600
theorem and the punicarusa inequality.

544
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,399
So first of all let me just recall what

545
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,919
they said um in the commutive case and

546
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,360
then this is a non-commutive case. So

547
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,320
then we'll have to talk about you know

548
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,360
what's actually true in the

549
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,200
non-commutive case.

550
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,799
Okay.

551
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:42,039
So you recall that if we have a

552
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,039
contained in z a commutative group

553
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,240
um then we have two important theorems

554
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:57,159
gaus

555
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,159
says that if a has a lot of energy

556
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,480
then it has a large subset

557
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:14,200
And the large subset is actually has a

558
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,200
small subset.

559
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,880
So this set has additive structure in

560
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,399
one sense but it has a large subset

561
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
which has additive structure in a

562
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,360
stronger sense.

563
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,840
And then once we have this there's

564
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,600
another important theorem the plunicus

565
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,440
theorem that says if a prime plus a

566
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,200
prime smaller than l * a prime so l will

567
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,679
be this

568
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,039
um then you can also look at the sum of

569
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:52,679
three of them or four of them or

570
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,679
whatever. So I'll write I'll just write

571
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,520
this guy is bounded by L to the 50th.

572
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,520
You could put other things. You get the

573
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,520
idea.

574
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,760
Okay. So this is a sort this sequence of

575
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,640
theorems is important because it gives a

576
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,840
sort of amplification of structure.

577
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,159
So this has this assumption is that A

578
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,440
has some additive structure in some

579
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,600
fairly weak sense and that implies that

580
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,480
a big subset has additive structure in a

581
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,919
stronger sense and then therefore it has

582
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,919
additive structure in even stronger

583
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,919
sense.

584
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,320
Okay. So if we were allowed to just

585
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
apply these two theorems then from this

586
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,600
moment we would get the conclusion of

587
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,600
theorem one. Conclusion of theorem one

588
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,159
would be that there's some set H which

589
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:47,159
could be could have been AK which obeys

590
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,159
this.

591
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,200
Okay. So

592
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,559
um so we we can't we can't do that

593
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,919
because this is for a commutive group.

594
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,440
So we need to talk about what happens in

595
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,760
a non-commutive group. Um but I thought

596
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,120
it was we'll talk about that. But I also

597
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,559
thought it was a nice moment to recall

598
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,799
these theorems and uh reappreciate that

599
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,279
they're important and useful and do

600
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,279
something kind of neat.

601
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,880
Um in our halfway through the course

602
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,640
check-in email when I asked people uh

603
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,399
you know what what things that we did do

604
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,159
you feel like they really sunk in and

605
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,840
you understood them and what things you

606
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,000
feel like it was sort of maybe hard to

607
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,240
remember what actually was happening. um

608
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
these this theorem in particular was

609
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
cited as something where it was hard

610
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,679
people did not feel like they remembered

611
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,120
very well what actually happened

612
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,120
so okay so we get to talk about it again

613
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,360
cool

614
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,200
um yeah oh I guess another thing you

615
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,279
might you might wonder is okay this is

616
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,039
logically is stronger than this but does

617
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,799
it really matter later when we look at

618
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,799
theorem two we'll have a good example

619
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,880
theorem two like really requires this as

620
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,080
an input so we'll see an interesting

621
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,080
example of why you might want this.

622
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,399
Okay.

623
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,640
So, um

624
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,720
let's talk about the balac summarity

625
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,799
garish theorem.

626
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,559
Um

627
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,080
so I will tell you okay yeah I guess

628
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,600
first I should tell you what is true in

629
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,240
the non-commutive world which really

630
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,080
looks pretty similar to this. Um, and

631
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,039
then we'll actually remember the proof a

632
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,399
little bit um to to see if we can get

633
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,399
the proof to sink in a little bit

634
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,399
deeper.

635
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay.

636
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,679
So, I'm going to erase this and what I

637
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,679
want us to remember is just that to

638
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,240
finish theorem one, what we need is a

639
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,880
good version of balag sum dows and

640
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,880
plunker rouia in the non-commutive fold.

641
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,799
All right. Um so theorem

642
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,200
non-commutative

643
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:26,159
balance over gallons. So it says if A is

644
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,120
a subset of a group G

645
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:34,960
um and the energy

646
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:38,960
a A is at least K inverse A cubed.

647
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:44,200
Um then there exists a subset a prime

648
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,200
and a so that it's pretty big

649
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,320
and um there are a few different things

650
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,440
we could write but

651
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,440
actually let me call this a tilda

652
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,000
a tilda time a tilda inverse is not too

653
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,679
Okay. So it looks very little different.

654
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,720
Um, but let's take this opportunity to

655
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,480
remember how the proof worked and see if

656
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,879
we can get it to sink in a little bit

657
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,839
more deeply.

658
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,839
All right, so proof sketch.

659
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,040
All right.

660
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,119
So, remember that the energy AA

661
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,720
is the sum over all of our group

662
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:56,159
elements

663
00:34:48,720 --> 00:35:00,800
of R A of G squared where R A of G is

664
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:06,280
the number of pairs A1 A2

665
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,280
squared. So that A1 A2 is G.

666
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,640
That's the energy. Okay. So for the

667
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,040
energy to be large, there must be a lot

668
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,760
of group elements G where this is pretty

669
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,760
large. We'll call those popular

670
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,760
products.

671
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,640
So um

672
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,960
P the set of popular products this is

673
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,680
the set of G where R A of G is greater

674
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,920
than K to the minus something.

675
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,359
times the size of a which so the size of

676
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,680
a is the biggest it could be and so

677
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,880
they're almost as big as it could be. So

678
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,400
they're quite popular.

679
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,640
Okay.

680
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,880
Uh all right. So it's an exercise to see

681
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,800
that if the energy is really big most of

682
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,280
the energy actually comes from popular

683
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,200
products.

684
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,079
So

685
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,960
energy aa is pretty much is yeah is more

686
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,560
than half comes from so half of the

687
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:16,040
energy of a is less than the sum over g

688
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,040
and the popular products of ra a g.

689
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,160
Okay. And so this is this is having

690
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,760
popular products that's almost

691
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,839
equivalent to having a line of energy.

692
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,400
Those are basically the same thing. Um,

693
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,880
all right. So then we'll do a little

694
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,440
thought experiment. Suppose that every

695
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,680
product was popular.

696
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,640
Every product in the product set of A

697
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,160
had the same number of representations.

698
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,520
Well, that number of representations

699
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,839
would have to be pretty large because

700
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,640
there's a lot of energy. And that would

701
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:51,440
tell us that A times A was small.

702
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,079
Okay. Um, so then we would be done. and

703
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,320
a tilda could just be a but that's not

704
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,320
true because it's it's not true that the

705
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,680
every every element can be written as a

706
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:05,200
product in the same number of ways.

707
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,920
Um so what we want to do we're hoping to

708
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,480
find a subset a tilda

709
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,640
so that all the products in a tilda a

710
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,040
tilda time a tilda they all can be

711
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:20,000
written uh as a product in lots of ways

712
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,720
or something in that space.

713
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,280
Okay. So now let's make the popular

714
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,280
product to graph.

715
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:40,040
So the vertices are G cross G. Here's a

716
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,040
copy of G. Here's a copy of G.

717
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:47,119
And um we put an edge

718
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:52,800
from A to B.

719
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:55,440
edge from a to b if um a * b is a

720
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,000
popular product.

721
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,520
Okay. And

722
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,280
um

723
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,680
right actually this is not a g by g

724
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,280
graph. This is an a by a graph taking

725
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,800
elements of our set and looking at their

726
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,320
products. Okay. So not every pair is a

727
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,599
popular product. They might not all be

728
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,960
popular. Uh but there are by hypothesis

729
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,119
because of there's a lot of energy.

730
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,040
There's a lot of popular products. So

731
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,040
the number of edges is at least

732
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,280
there are lots of edges in this graph.

733
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,960
Okay.

734
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Um

735
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,920
so a tilda is going to be some subset o

736
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,160
over here. And the good feature of a

737
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,400
tilda

738
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,440
is that for every a1 and a2 both in a

739
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:56,680
tilda there are many edges there are

740
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,680
many paths. So let me let me draw it. Um

741
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,359
okay so let's say this is a1 and this is

742
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,400
a2. And then we're going to think of

743
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:14,280
paths of length four that go

744
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,280
from A1 to A2.

745
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,920
So there are many

746
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,400
are

747
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,400
more than something

748
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,320
paths of length four that go from A1 to

749
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,320
A2 in our graph.

750
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:40,480
Okay. Um and how many? Well,

751
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:45,040
the from a typical point there are about

752
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,119
maybe one over k times a uh edges out.

753
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,079
And so

754
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,240
uh so we have you know a choices a

755
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,480
choices a choices and then we have to go

756
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,480
to a2.

757
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Okay. So there was a graph theory lema

758
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,760
that we can choose a substantial set a

759
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,520
tilda here that has all of these edges

760
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,599
and that was the hardest part of the

761
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,880
proof but it's exactly the same as

762
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,680
before. It had nothing to do with

763
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,119
anything being commutative. So I I just

764
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,920
uh that part I won't repeat.

765
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,440
So there was a lema

766
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:35,839
that we can choose

767
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,560
a tilda so that this is true. Um and a

768
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,560
tilda is pretty big.

769
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,800
Okay.

770
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,960
Um

771
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,920
cool.

772
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,520
So, let's name everybody in the middle

773
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,000
here.

774
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,640
Um,

775
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,599
name these. Let me actually rename

776
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,119
these.

777
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,000
Um,

778
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll call these a

779
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:20,800
a and a prime. And then we go over here

780
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:24,800
to a1 to a2 to a3.

781
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,359
So we know a a1 is popular. We know a2 *

782
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,400
a1 is popular. We know a2 * a3 is

783
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,400
popular and so on.

784
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,359
Okay.

785
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,480
And what this allows us to do is to

786
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,200
write a over a prime in many different

787
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,920
ways.

788
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,400
Okay. So

789
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,839
a over. Okay. I have to be careful

790
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,079
because I'm in a non-commutive group. I

791
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,800
think I want to write a let's call this

792
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,800
a tilda

793
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:02,480
a * a tilda inverse.

794
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:07,680
So that's a * a1.

795
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:12,000
And now I'll put a2 * a1 inverse.

796
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,480
And now I'll put a2 * a3. And then I'll

797
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,240
put a

798
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,240
tilda * a3 inverse.

799
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,599
So if we do this out.

800
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:31,119
So this guy here is a1 inverse a2

801
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,960
inverse. You can see cancellation

802
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,560
cancellation.

803
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,599
And this guy here is a3 inverse a tilda

804
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,079
inverse. Cancel that. So that's this

805
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,560
equality. So not difficult.

806
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,640
Um but we've written it in terms of four

807
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:54,079
guys that are popular.

808
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,839
So this um a2 * a1 is not just a2 * a1.

809
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,720
It's a popular product. It can be

810
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,880
written in many different ways.

811
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,040
So

812
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:09,800
a tilda a * a tilda inverse can be

813
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,800
written as um

814
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,880
z1 z2 inverse or maybe p1

815
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:22,640
p2 inverse

816
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:26,839
p3 p4 inverse where pi are popular.

817
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,839
Um and so

818
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,760
um

819
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,960
right okay and it and this can be done

820
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,960
in many different ways

821
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:51,040
and and the number of choices

822
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:53,599
for the pi is at least uh a cubed.

823
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,119
Okay. So the conclusion is that the size

824
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,520
of a tilda time a tilda inverse is

825
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,200
bounded by I'm going to choose four

826
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,640
popular guys. So that's p to the 4th and

827
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,119
then I I've overcounted because each

828
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,599
person has now been represented a cubed

829
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,400
different ways and ignoring some factors

830
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,400
of k.

831
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,400
And so that's

832
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,400
a

833
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Okay.

834
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,040
Okay. So, I remember the first time I

835
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,160
taught it, I struggled a little bit with

836
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,319
the intuition of this. Um the first

837
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,160
thing you might hope to do is to choose

838
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,640
a tilda so that every product in a tilda

839
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,240
can be is popular. they all can be

840
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,920
written in many ways just as a product

841
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,319
of two things in a and then there are

842
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,640
clearly not so many of those but I think

843
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,319
it's not possible to do that it's not

844
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,319
possible to choose a tilda where every

845
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,480
one of these products is popular in that

846
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:07,119
sense

847
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,359
but by take by by by being a little bit

848
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,200
more flexible we've chosen a tilda so

849
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:16,079
that every quotient can be written in

850
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,640
many ways um not just as a quotient of

851
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,400
two things in a but many ways in this in

852
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,400
this uh slightly more flexible

853
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,400
framework.

854
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,920
Okay. Any questions or comments?

855
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,599
>> Yeah.

856
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,280
>> So, why can't you get the same result

857
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,720
for a * a if you just choose paths of

858
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,240
length three?

859
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,319
>> Yeah, I think you could get the same

860
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,119
result for a * a if you choose paths of

861
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,280
length three or a * b. Yeah. So, okay.

862
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,520
Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I maybe was

863
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,040
not transparent about um so the the

864
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,920
thing with positive length three still

865
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,640
still works. Um I think that might

866
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,480
produce two different subsets. Um

867
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,599
actually maybe in the commutive case I

868
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,200
actually should have had two different

869
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,119
subsets.

870
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,160
Um

871
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,160
at least initially um it works fine and

872
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,839
the and the reason that I have a tilda*

873
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,680
a tilda inverse the motivation for that

874
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,200
is going to come in a moment and

875
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,560
actually I'm going to try to argue that

876
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,880
this is better than a * a

877
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,480
And uh just a clarifying thing the way

878
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,520
you stated it before the popular

879
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,319
products here is the subset of a * a

880
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,680
with a small projection

881
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:35,599
right it was stated in terms of uh a

882
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,280
subset having a um large projection then

883
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:43,599
that leads to you can choose a subset of

884
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,960
a such that the um subset is small.

885
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,599
>> Yeah that's right. That's right. So in

886
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,200
the projection theory version the this

887
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,119
would be the small projection and

888
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,880
there'd be some big piece of a cross a

889
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,880
that that projects here. Yeah.

890
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,040
Okay cool. Um so this is the

891
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:06,400
non-commutative analog of bacity gow. It

892
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,240
really looks a lot like bacity gus and

893
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,000
this inverse is because we want it. We

894
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,960
probably could we could also have had a

895
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,560
tilda time b tilda if we want.

896
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,920
Okay. Um the situation with Pluna Caruza

897
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,920
is actually a little bit more

898
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,920
complicated.

899
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,960
So non-commutative

900
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,079
All right. So let's ask a question.

901
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:54,760
Suppose we have a is a subset of a group

902
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,760
and a * a is small.

903
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,800
Does it imply that a * a * a is small?

904
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,440
So this would be that natural analog of

905
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,200
plumus inequality. And the answer to

906
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,200
this is no.

907
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,839
Okay, here's the example.

908
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,720
So let's say H contained in G is a

909
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:28,000
subgroup and A is H union one other

910
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:32,559
element which is not in the subgroup.

911
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,800
Now what happens when I take A * A? A *

912
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:42,240
A is H * H. That's good.

913
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:44,400
plus or union h * g union g * h union g

914
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,000
* g.

915
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,599
Okay, there's nothing special about

916
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,480
these, but because g is only one

917
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:54,079
element, all of this stuff is small.

918
00:48:50,480 --> 00:49:00,640
So we can see that a * a is smaller than

919
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:04,800
1 2 3 smaller than 4 a probably 3 a.

920
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,359
Okay. But now what happens when I take a

921
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,240
* a * a?

922
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:16,640
Okay. Now I have three factors. And so

923
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:18,880
that concludes h * g * h.

924
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,319
And in the non-commutative world, I

925
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,559
cannot slide this over. And this is not

926
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:30,000
so good. There's no reason for this to

927
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:33,040
be small. And so the size of h * g * h

928
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,640
is could be

929
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,640
could well be the size of h squ.

930
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:48,440
Okay, so that didn't work very well.

931
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,440
Um

932
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,520
what to do about it?

933
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:00,319
There is a theorem that if a * a * a is

934
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:03,839
small then a * a * a * a is small. Yeah.

935
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:07,359
>> Does the time example that you show have

936
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:11,599
an example in s of p?

937
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:14,400
>> Yeah it does. Um so h could be any any

938
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,760
subgroup say a burell subgroup and g is

939
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:22,040
not in there. Yeah this will happen.

940
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,040
So this this could happen in SL2F.

941
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,200
Okay.

942
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,119
Um so there is a theorem that if you

943
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,760
assume that a product of three copies of

944
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:37,359
A is small then the product of four

945
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,359
copies of A is also small. Um but that

946
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,359
theorem is not immediately useful to us

947
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,280
because we don't have any input that a

948
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:49,200
product of three things is small.

949
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,960
Um okay there's another fix to this.

950
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:56,599
Let's just suppose think about this

951
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,599
example and how we might fix it. Um

952
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,480
so this example has a lot of algebraic

953
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,680
structure and this is the algebraically

954
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,839
structured part and this is garbage.

955
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,520
um and

956
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:13,280
we need it would be helpful to separate

957
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,359
a into the structured part and the

958
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:19,119
garbage.

959
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:22,880
So how might we do that?

960
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:26,240
So let's let's look at

961
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,240
um so this is the continuing in the

962
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,240
example.

963
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:38,720
Let's look at a * a inverse

964
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,839
You could do a time. Anyway, this works

965
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:47,079
a little bit better for a time a so what

966
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,079
do we have? We have h * h

967
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,480
actually. Yeah. So, so we will

968
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,640
eventually look at a * a inverse. But um

969
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,079
let's think about how we how we might

970
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:03,280
separate this. So,

971
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,440
so this set has different pieces

972
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,359
and we can

973
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,200
if we want to separate the algebraic

974
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,640
part from the garbage.

975
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,640
So, we'd like to find this part and

976
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,480
distinguish it from that part, right?

977
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,960
How are they different from each other?

978
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,720
Well, let's think about how many

979
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,920
representations there are for each

980
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,599
product in this product set. Any product

981
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:30,400
in here has many, many representations.

982
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,720
And the products here have only one

983
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,880
representation.

984
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,960
So this guy here is the set of popular

985
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,280
products.

986
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,960
And actually that if once we identified

987
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,319
it, the popular product set then is an

988
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,720
actual subgroup. It has a lot of

989
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:49,520
algebraic structure.

990
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,160
Okay. So now let that motivate the

991
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,000
following proposition which is an analog

992
00:52:52,160 --> 00:53:00,000
of plate.

993
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,640
It says if um a * a inverse is less than

994
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,400
or equal to k a

995
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,839
so a inverse that means take each

996
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,160
element of a and take its inverse.

997
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:13,839
Um then

998
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:16,839
okay and then if Q is the set of popular

999
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,839
quotients

1000
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,480
so it's the set of g so that um r a a

1001
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,960
inverse of g is bigger than k to the

1002
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,960
something a

1003
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,480
then

1004
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:41,000
you can raise q to any power you like q

1005
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,000
let's say we do L times.

1006
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,359
So Q has a lot of algebraic structure

1007
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:01,720
and their proof has a similar idea of

1008
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,720
writing things in many different ways.

1009
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,960
Okay. So proof um

1010
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Okay.

1011
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,280
Oh, actually I think it's a little bit

1012
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,280
tricky. I think it should be that.

1013
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:42,160
Okay. So the proof is let's look at a *

1014
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:45,119
Q * Q

1015
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,720
say I'll illustrate the proof in L= 4.

1016
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:52,040
Let's illustrate with L equ= 3. That'll

1017
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,040
give you the idea. Times A inverse.

1018
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,640
So somebody in here can be written as

1019
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,559
little a and now this is a popular

1020
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,400
quotient. So this is little a2 inverse

1021
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:10,200
little a3

1022
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,200
and there are many choices

1023
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,640
and then actually let's illustrate with

1024
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,440
l equals 2

1025
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,599
and then we have

1026
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,160
uh here we'll have little a4 inverse

1027
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,880
little a5

1028
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:31,440
We have many choices here. How many

1029
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:34,000
choices? We have about a choices

1030
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,160
have about a

1031
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,559
choices

1032
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:46,480
and then at the end I'll do this

1033
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:50,760
A6 inverse A7 about eight traces

1034
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,760
and then A8 inverse.

1035
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,839
All right. So, so to say more better

1036
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:02,000
what I'm saying, suppose that I have an

1037
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:06,319
element of this set, then I can write

1038
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,720
the element this way. And so I can say

1039
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:13,920
that X belongs to um

1040
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:17,799
a A inverse.

1041
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,799
So x can be written

1042
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:27,760
as um all right okay so x can be written

1043
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,839
in in many different ways

1044
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,680
and for each way of writing it we'll

1045
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,359
notice that this guy lives in a a

1046
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,839
inverse that guy lives in a aa ina

1047
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:44,079
inverse and so on

1048
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:50,400
so can be written in around a cubed ways

1049
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:53,400
as b1 b2 b3 b4 where the b i are in a a

1050
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,400
inverse.

1051
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:01,079
Okay. So

1052
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,079
the size of this set

1053
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,680
this is bounded by the size of a a

1054
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,599
inverse to the fourth.

1055
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,559
So I get to choose these B's and now

1056
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,400
I've overounted because each for each X

1057
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,960
there are around a cub different choices

1058
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:22,839
of how I could write it

1059
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,839
/ Aub and that is smaller than

1060
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,359
Um, okay. There's one thing I hid at the

1061
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,000
beginning. Um, let me do it properly and

1062
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:59,839
then pause and see what people think. So

1063
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,640
we were given a * a inverse

1064
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:07,520
is small and that implies that the

1065
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:10,000
energy of a a inverse is large.

1066
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,960
This is stronger than this.

1067
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,799
And now I'd like to switch these. And

1068
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:20,799
this is is actually the same as this.

1069
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:23,599
So even though I don't know a inverse

1070
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,319
time a is small, I do know that a

1071
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,920
inverse a has a lot of energy. And the

1072
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:34,160
reason I can switch them is if I have a1

1073
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,920
a2 inverse equals a3 a4 inverse, that's

1074
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,640
a quadruple that's being counted in this

1075
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:43,520
energy. Uh let's just rearrange things a

1076
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:47,440
little bit. I divide by a3 a3 inverse a1

1077
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:52,599
a2 inverse equals a4 inverse. Then I

1078
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,599
will multiply on the right by a2.

1079
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,960
So that's a quadruple that's being

1080
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,799
counted here. Yeah.

1081
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,640
>> Didn't you know that big inverse a has

1082
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,280
to be small because it's just the

1083
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,960
inverse of any element in a inverse or a

1084
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,440
a

1085
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,160
>> Oh. Um

1086
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,640
yeah, maybe that's true. Yeah, maybe I

1087
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:17,599
made this too complicated. So these are

1088
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:22,559
equal but you you claim that actually a

1089
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:25,839
inverse time a is a a * a inverse. So

1090
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:31,119
over here I have a1 a2 inverse. If I

1091
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:33,520
invert it if I invert that I get

1092
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,520
uh what's the inverse of this? Should

1093
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,520
invert this one. I don't think this

1094
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,280
quite works.

1095
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,000
>> So I didn't manage to switch the order

1096
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:45,440
when I did that. But I can switch the

1097
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,240
order when I look at the quadruple.

1098
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,240
Okay, good try.

1099
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:56,960
Okay, so so this is large.

1100
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,480
So therefore there are lots of popular

1101
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,559
quotients.

1102
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,559
So Q is large which is what we used

1103
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,559
here.

1104
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,280
Okay. So both both of these proofs have

1105
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,119
a following highle idea. Um there's a

1106
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,720
lot of energy around. So it frequently

1107
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:20,160
happens that you can write a product or

1108
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:23,119
a quotient in many different ways. And

1109
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,520
if you could arrange a set where every

1110
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,200
product could be written in many ways

1111
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,640
then you estimate you could get a clean

1112
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:33,920
estimate for the size of the product

1113
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:36,240
set. And um by uh playing around with

1114
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,799
the sort of products that that you

1115
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,960
consider and by some experience and

1116
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:43,960
craft and skill we we can get that to

1117
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,960
happen.

1118
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,119
Okay. So this is the analog of Plunka's

1119
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:53,599
inequality and the reason that it was

1120
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,880
sort of desirable to put a tilda a tilda

1121
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:59,520
inverse in bali gowers is that that

1122
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,520
thing is designed to fit into to this

1123
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,520
thing.

1124
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,760
Okay. So this Q is the approximate

1125
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,000
subgroup that we were that we were

1126
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:16,960
looking for which is the you know the

1127
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,960
conclusion of of of theorem one.

1128
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,359
Okay, so this finishes the discussion of

1129
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:28,880
theorem one as a pretty detailed proof

1130
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:30,480
sketch. Um, and it is a fair somewhat

1131
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,799
different setup that shows the

1132
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,559
significance of the idea of like balm

1133
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:38,280
garrison and plarusa and this

1134
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,280
cominatorial methods.

1135
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,200
Okay. So now in the 15 minutes that's

1136
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,880
left, I'd like to I'm going to try to

1137
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,200
say a little bit about the proof of

1138
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,960
theorem 2. Uh and the proof of theorem 2

1139
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,440
it also connects um with um with themes

1140
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,760
of the of the class and especially with

1141
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,240
how some estimates are different in the

1142
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,799
case of a prime field or the case of a

1143
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,799
non-prime field.

1144
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,720
Okay.

1145
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:50,119
So let's have so let's do discussion of

1146
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,119
theorem too.

1147
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,200
All right, I'd like to put us in the

1148
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,440
following framework. We're going to look

1149
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:03,920
at SL2 of KAR where K bar is an

1150
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,240
algebraically closed field. Could

1151
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,000
imagine it's the the algebraic closure

1152
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,480
of FP.

1153
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,119
All right. And we're going to look at

1154
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:17,039
subgroups

1155
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:21,599
of SL2 and K bar.

1156
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:24,240
Um, okay. So here let's remember the

1157
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,400
some easy ones

1158
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:30,160
have a subgroup like this where a and a

1159
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:33,359
inverse are in this field. Um we have

1160
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:38,720
the burell subgroup.

1161
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:42,359
So that's a a inverse t and we have the

1162
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,359
unitary subgroup.

1163
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,079
So those are some subgroups.

1164
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,680
We can take uh conjugates of them

1165
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,280
actually. Let me come back to that.

1166
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,960
Okay. Yeah. So then we can do two

1167
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,960
general things. We can look at sub

1168
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,960
fields.

1169
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,720
So I can take SL2K

1170
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:08,720
where K contained in K bar is a sub

1171
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,960
field.

1172
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,760
Or you could take this any of these with

1173
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:16,400
a sub field. Those are subgroups. And

1174
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,640
you could take conjugates.

1175
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,880
conjugate any any subgroup you get

1176
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,799
another subgroup.

1177
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,400
Okay, so that is a bunch of subgroups

1178
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:28,000
that we can identify without too much

1179
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:31,200
trouble that sit inside of SL2 of K bar.

1180
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Um, okay. And there is a theorem that

1181
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:37,039
says that this is not exactly but

1182
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,799
reasonably close to the to the full

1183
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,799
list.

1184
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:43,280
Um,

1185
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:47,599
okay.

1186
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,119
So Dixon in 1901 gave a full

1187
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,599
classification

1188
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,599
of these subgroups

1189
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,559
and it's a little bit messy. It includes

1190
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,839
a variety of finite subgroups in certain

1191
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:05,920
cases and so on. Um and his theorem

1192
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:08,640
implies that if H is an actual subgroup

1193
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:16,559
um then

1194
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:18,799
either um H is contained in a conjugate

1195
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:21,760
of SL2K

1196
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:25,200
where K is a sub field

1197
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,599
uh or most of H is contained in a

1198
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,599
conjugative.

1199
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:43,839
Okay. And if we know from the beginning

1200
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:47,280
that we're talking about a subgroup of

1201
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:49,119
SL2 of FP, a proper subgroup of SL2 FP,

1202
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,079
it eliminates the first case. So we must

1203
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:53,520
be in the second case.

1204
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,079
All right.

1205
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:59,039
Um,

1206
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:01,200
but Dixon's methods are are some of them

1207
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,200
at least are not very robust. If you

1208
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:07,200
replace the hypothesis of being an

1209
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:10,400
actual subgroup by something like H* H

1210
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,240
is pretty small. Um, so here's a here's

1211
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,799
a common example of a technique that we

1212
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,400
use to classify subgroups that does not

1213
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,880
do very well if we replace it by

1214
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,760
approximate subgroups. example is

1215
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,559
there's a uh the order of the subgroup

1216
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,200
divides the order of the group. That's

1217
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:29,119
really useful in 18701.

1218
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,839
You want to classify the subgroups of

1219
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,319
some group with eight elements. Um but

1220
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:36,880
it is something like that is not going

1221
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:39,359
to survive an approximate subgroup in

1222
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:43,359
any useful way.

1223
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:47,039
Okay. Um so the the proof of theorem two

1224
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:50,000
is based on a rather different strategy

1225
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:55,119
for for this classification that's due

1226
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:59,680
to Larsson and pink. Um okay so um so

1227
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:03,319
let me say part A which is the Larson

1228
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,319
and pink strategy.

1229
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:11,760
All right. So we're going to think about

1230
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,319
how a subgroup inter intersects this

1231
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,520
these uh

1232
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:21,119
these subgroups.

1233
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:23,839
Uh so if you take SL2K and you intersect

1234
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:27,200
it with one of these,

1235
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:29,760
it will either be empty or it would just

1236
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:34,640
be identity or something like that or it

1237
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:38,799
will be a subgroup that's like t0 of K.

1238
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:43,960
Um okay. So we're going to study

1239
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:43,960
H intersected with T.

1240
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:50,160
T of K bar

1241
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:54,079
H intersected with B of K bar.

1242
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:56,880
H intersected with U of K bar.

1243
01:07:54,079 --> 01:08:01,280
And we'll see the following behavior.

1244
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:08,520
The h intersected with t of k bar

1245
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:08,520
is roughly h to the 1/3 or big o of 1.

1246
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:20,080
So if I take sl2 fp and I intersect it

1247
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,080
with this I'll get t0 of fp there'll be

1248
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:25,040
about p of those which is about the cube

1249
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,520
root of the size of sl2fp.

1250
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,319
if I take some crazy Taurus in algebraic

1251
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:33,759
closure that it may not intersect this

1252
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,040
except at the identity. Um so so these

1253
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:40,199
these are the two things that could

1254
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:40,199
happen and then similarly with these

1255
01:08:55,279 --> 01:09:00,719
Right? So they first proved that if you

1256
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,719
take an arbitrary group and you consider

1257
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,839
how it intersects these kind of

1258
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,719
fundamental algebraic subgroups that it

1259
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:10,799
behaves a lot like it were SL2 of a sub

1260
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,679
field

1261
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,920
and then building from this they were

1262
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:19,359
able to see that actually it it would

1263
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,480
have to be SL2 of a sub field. So that's

1264
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:23,040
their approach to the rough

1265
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:26,960
classification.

1266
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:29,759
Um yeah so this so this was a a cool

1267
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,199
paper um in pure group they they weren't

1268
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,960
interested in approximate subgroups they

1269
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:35,279
they were interested in pure group

1270
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:40,080
theory problem classifying subgroups of

1271
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:43,040
SLD of K or other other like le groups

1272
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,799
over finite fields. Um

1273
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,199
and the complete classification is

1274
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:48,960
clearly hard because any finite group

1275
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:52,640
embeds in a permutation group which

1276
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,320
embeds in SLD of FP. So all finite

1277
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:59,840
groups occur as subgroups of SLD of FP

1278
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,840
for sum D and sum P. Um and so it's so

1279
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,400
so it's it's not really plausible to

1280
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,440
give a complete classification or anyway

1281
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,960
it would be at least as hard as

1282
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,040
classifying finite groups to give a

1283
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,920
complete classification but they were

1284
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:14,560
able to classify um I think it's like

1285
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,440
subgroups of SLD of FP which have at

1286
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:19,840
least some size like P to the epsilon or

1287
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:23,679
epsilon* d or something like this the

1288
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,920
ones that are decently large um and uh

1289
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:28,800
and that was in you know around 2000s

1290
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,440
really is a hard thing Um, okay. But it

1291
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,840
also turns out that their method uh

1292
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:37,120
interacts well with just assuming that h

1293
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:42,480
* h * h * h is small.

1294
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:45,800
So here this whole argument works if we

1295
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,800
just assume

1296
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:52,600
that h * h * h * h *

1297
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,440
okay I may or may not have like two

1298
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,360
minutes to try to describe what they

1299
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,840
yeah how this part works significance of

1300
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:06,159
the algebraic closure like why if if we

1301
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,520
only care about subgroups of a sub2 to

1302
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:11,199
FP. What is the what what information

1303
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,880
are you gaining from intersecting with

1304
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,400
that?

1305
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,760
>> Yeah. So the question is why bring into

1306
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,840
play the algebraic closure

1307
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,640
>> also what is the algebraic closure of

1308
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,040
FP?

1309
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,760
>> And what is the algebraic closure of FP?

1310
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,760
Yeah. Um

1311
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,440
I am um

1312
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:38,080
right. Okay. you you do you do need this

1313
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,239
for the following reason that should

1314
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,199
that should be familiar to us even as

1315
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:45,920
analysts. Um so suppose you have a

1316
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:48,320
matrix in SL2R

1317
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,840
and you would like to diagonalize it.

1318
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,440
You'd like to look at its IGEN values or

1319
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,600
whatever. Well, you can't necessarily do

1320
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:59,120
that in SL2R

1321
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,040
um um because the IGEN values could be

1322
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,120
complex. So in order to diagonalize it,

1323
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,280
you might want to move to SL2C. And

1324
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,880
diagonalizing matrices is is useful

1325
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:10,800
because um you know you can

1326
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,560
you can classify matrices by their

1327
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,880
Jordan canonical form. And this is a

1328
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,239
convenient way to organize things. And

1329
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,800
that's the same thing that's going on

1330
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,480
here.

1331
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,640
>> But like the intersections look the same

1332
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,679
though, right? Like the intersection of

1333
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,920
if H is just a subgroup of SL2 K, then

1334
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:28,000
the intersection of T K bar is the same

1335
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,000
as the intersection of TK.

1336
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,840
>> Yeah, that's correct. That's correct.

1337
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:37,199
But um okay, so the comment the comment

1338
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:44,480
was that if if uh okay so what did this

1339
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:48,239
so um if h is in sl2 k then h

1340
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:52,080
intersected with t kn of k bar is the

1341
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:53,760
same thing as h intersected with t kn of

1342
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,679
k.

1343
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,280
Yeah. Okay. I think the problem with is

1344
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,679
that I I forgot to say something about

1345
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:02,000
what's written on the board here. This t

1346
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:04,800
is not t.

1347
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:09,760
Um the conjugates are really important.

1348
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:12,400
So t of k bar is a conjugate of t kn of

1349
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,040
k bar.

1350
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,159
>> Yeah. Are the kind of elements that are

1351
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:20,960
being diagonalized like just elements of

1352
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:23,199
SL2 or kind of bigger linear operators

1353
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,600
on SL2?

1354
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:28,719
>> Uh think if it's just SL2, you only need

1355
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,040
the degree two extensions.

1356
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,679
>> Yeah, that so the comment is that if we

1357
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,320
just want to diagonalize matrices in SL2

1358
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:38,640
FP, we probably only need a degree 2

1359
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,719
extension of FP, which which we might

1360
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,159
feel more comfortable with. Uh I think

1361
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,280
that's probably right. I think we could

1362
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:46,280
probably work with the degree two

1363
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,280
extension.

1364
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,040
Okay.

1365
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,360
Um

1366
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:24,960
All right. So the output

1367
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:28,960
of the Larsson pink argument

1368
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,440
is um after conjugating.

1369
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:35,760
Okay. So yeah. So first so first of all

1370
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:38,560
we can arrange that um our h intersected

1371
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,920
with some unitary guy

1372
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,920
is pretty big.

1373
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:49,120
And after conjugating we can arrange

1374
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:52,120
that this is you not k.

1375
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,120
So

1376
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,000
so

1377
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,159
h contains

1378
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,960
some guys like this where t is in sub

1379
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:05,120
subset that I'll call e and e is pretty

1380
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:08,120
big.

1381
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,120
Um

1382
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:16,159
okay and moreover this part is still

1383
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:21,040
should not expand too much when we take

1384
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:24,159
products. Um so here let's call let's

1385
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,000
call this thing sort of a unitary piece

1386
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:29,520
of h

1387
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,040
uh * uh also this isn't completely

1388
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,280
obvious but it's not that difficult. It

1389
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:36,159
shouldn't be that much bigger than uh H.

1390
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:40,600
And that tells us that E plus E

1391
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:40,600
shouldn't be that much bigger than E.

1392
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:47,440
Okay.

1393
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:51,199
Also, we should have this this U is in

1394
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:54,880
some B and H intersect

1395
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:57,440
B of K bar.

1396
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,679
Uh well, so we've we've already

1397
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:02,640
conjugated so that U is U not. So this

1398
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:07,400
is going to be b and this should be

1399
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,400
around um h to the 2/3.

1400
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:16,159
Okay. So uh and inside of there we'll

1401
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:19,120
have a t and h intersect that should be

1402
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:23,280
like h to the 1/3.

1403
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:27,719
So h intersect t k bar. Um that's going

1404
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,719
to be some guys that look like this.

1405
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,679
and these A's live in some set that I'll

1406
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,840
call F.

1407
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:39,440
Okay. So then if you think about how

1408
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,920
these matrices act on these matrices,

1409
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,560
um we should get

1410
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,400
so T0.

1411
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:52,080
So let's call this guy uh T the T part

1412
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:55,080
of H and U

1413
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,080
here.

1414
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:02,880
Wow. Okay. and um and and and and this

1415
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:05,440
thing here is the B part of H.

1416
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,199
Okay, so the B part of H times the B

1417
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:11,080
part of H should be not that much bigger

1418
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,080
than the B part of H.

1419
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:18,320
And if you unwind what that means, you

1420
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:24,320
multiply these you'll have things like a

1421
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:29,360
a inverse a T where a is an F, T is an

1422
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:35,320
E. So the conclusion is that E* F is

1423
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:35,320
also not that much bigger than E or F.

1424
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:51,280
So in other words once you have like a

1425
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:53,520
unipotent piece where you have have

1426
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,679
these guys then this multiplication

1427
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,600
operation just gives you addition of the

1428
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,880
numbers in here. So you have a like a

1429
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:04,560
simpler thing. And then once you have a

1430
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,159
bunch of upper triangular guys um then

1431
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,159
um

1432
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:09,159
uh

1433
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:16,000
um then this multiplication just gives

1434
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,159
you this matrix multiplication induces

1435
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,719
this regular multiplication and we have

1436
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:22,640
small products.

1437
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,560
Okay.

1438
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,800
So this is consistent with the pro

1439
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,120
possibility that E and F could both be

1440
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,920
just some sub field K or some

1441
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:34,000
approximate sub fields. But the sum

1442
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,840
product theorem says that FP has no

1443
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,520
approximate subfields. And so the

1444
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:41,440
subproduct theorem rules out the

1445
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:44,640
possibility that this could happen.

1446
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:48,360
So the conclusion is the

1447
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,360
sum product theorem

1448
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,440
that this can't happen.

1449
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:05,360
Yeah.

1450
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:09,120
[Applause]

1451
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:10,960
Yeah. So, so what's on the board? Let me

1452
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,800
I I should add one thing. So, we're

1453
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:19,239
going to assume

1454
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:19,239
that H is not contained in a BL guy.

1455
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,960
Right? So this this whole thing would

1456
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,440
that that wouldn't be true for the

1457
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,000
burell subgroup. Um it's only true once

1458
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,440
we assume that our subgroup is not not

1459
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,080
contained in burell. And then we get

1460
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:38,560
this and that tells us that it has to

1461
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,800
look uh

1462
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:43,679
uh like the intersection sizes have to

1463
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,000
match SL2 of a sub field.

1464
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:48,239
And then if you look more carefully at

1465
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,719
what the matrices that appear in the

1466
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:52,400
intersections, you see that the entries

1467
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,880
there have to be kind of like a sub

1468
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:58,920
field. And then it becomes a question of

1469
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,920
whether there are approximate subfields.

1470
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,960
Okay, let me say it one more time and

1471
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:09,840
then we will break for the week. So the

1472
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,600
theorem says that if you have a subgroup

1473
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,440
which is not pretty much contained in a

1474
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:17,679
burell subgroup then it must be SL2 of a

1475
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:21,360
sub field.

1476
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:23,280
Okay. Uh so we take and and it's going

1477
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,440
to be true for honest subgroups but it's

1478
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,280
also true for approximate subgroups. So

1479
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,040
imagine we have an approximate subgroup.

1480
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,280
We're going to gradually prove that it

1481
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,120
has more and more properties of SL2 of a

1482
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,360
finite field.

1483
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,719
So the first property we will consider

1484
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:42,320
is uh how it intersects various

1485
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:44,320
algebraic subgroups of SL2 of KAR and

1486
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,320
the sizes of those intersections behave

1487
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:49,840
in a way that matches what you would

1488
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,760
expect from SL2 of a sub field.

1489
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,080
There's this there's a substantial thing

1490
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,960
to say about this proof that we we won't

1491
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:59,840
have time to do in this class. Um okay

1492
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,360
but once you know that um these

1493
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,600
subgroups are useful because the

1494
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:07,199
matrices in here are simpler than

1495
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:09,199
general 2x2 matrices. So the unitary

1496
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,640
subgroup has matrices that look like

1497
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,880
this. And when we multiply them you just

1498
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:14,320
add the upper right hand corner. And so

1499
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,159
now if you just look at these upper

1500
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,000
right hand corners you see that adding

1501
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:20,400
those numbers it doesn't change very

1502
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,800
much. That's a property of a sub field.

1503
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:27,520
So it's behaving like a sub field. and

1504
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,280
the upper diagonal matrices um you are

1505
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,040
the multiplication rule is only a little

1506
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,800
bit more complicated. It's a it's a

1507
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:35,040
pretty simple mix of multiplication and

1508
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,800
addition. So you could see you know that

1509
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,320
that that these diagonal entries they

1510
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,640
should be almost closed under

1511
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,320
multiplication and they interact with

1512
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,000
each other and and so you would get

1513
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,600
something like this. Anyway, all those

1514
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,560
things being consistent algebraically

1515
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:53,159
with being a sub field.

1516
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,159
>> Okay. Yeah. How did we use 2.5?

1517
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,800
>> Uh, where did we use 2.5?

1518
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:18,400
Yeah, that's a good question. Actually,

1519
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:20,400
I don't see where we used that here.

1520
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:24,880
um

1521
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:26,880
ah yeah we used that um here so so at

1522
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:30,639
the end we have to say E and F cannot be

1523
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:32,480
approximately a sub field so and that

1524
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,880
requires that they're significantly

1525
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,120
smaller than FP so if you take FP and

1526
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,800
you remove like two or three elements it

1527
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:41,520
is almost closed under addition and

1528
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,040
multiplication so that would be this

1529
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,520
could happen then if you were allowed to

1530
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:50,040
take a really large subset of FP a

1531
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,040
really large subset of sub 2 FP.

1532
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,239
Okay, cool. I apologize for going over.

1533
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,840
Thanks for your patience. Uh, have a

1534
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:02,840
good weekend and I will see you next

1535
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,840
week.
