1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,240
good morning everybody Welcome to the

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,440
mpg primer

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,759
today um just a reminder that we are

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,559
looking for the next MPG co-chair so

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,960
someone to stand alongside me next year

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,240
help pick speakers help pick topics help

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,840
run the show um if you're interested

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,599
there's a QR code you can nominate

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,840
yourself or also someone that might be

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,840
you think would be good for the job

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,040
this is a thank you Kevin in the

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,680
back he does a lot of work in the behind

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,920
the scenes of the mpg and today is his

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,440
last day so let's give him a thank you

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,440
last day

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,320
Applause today we're supposed to have

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,760
Max Holbrook talk about

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,879
epigenetics um and something came up in

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,760
um Yan who with 13 hours ago spilled in

20
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,399
the spot so uh saved the day so you guys

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,640
could all be here learn some science and

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,879
eat some great food um so thank you

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,760
again so so

24
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,640
much yenu is a PhD candidate in Jason

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,000
ber Roos lab in the stem cell and

26

regenerative biology department at

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,640
Harvard he's also affiliate member here

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,320
at the Bro Institute prior to his

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,600
Graduate Studies he received his

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,720
Bachelor of Science and biology from

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,560
tingua University in China and broadly

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,280
his uh interest in rare Gene regulation

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,439
aging and computational biology um and

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,600
today he's going to share um some

35
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,960
epigenetic insights from a new paper

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,479
they just published uh tracking protein

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,320
binding to Sis regulatory elements with

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,720
print please ask questions along the way

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,159
there's two microphones set up in the

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,920
middle or you could also raise your hand

41
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,360
and I'll run over to you so thank

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,320
you uh can everyone hear

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,920
me okay awesome um so thank you all for

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,240
coming here this this early uh and uh

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm very happy to be here today uh my

46
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,719
name is Yen and I want to share with you

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,000
a very recent story published by our lab

48
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,759
uh where we developed a new technology

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
more precisely a more a new

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,400
computational method called print that

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
allows you to track The Binding of

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,840
regulatory proteins in C regory elements

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,040
across the genome with single cell

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,160
attack seek so I want to start by

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,680
talking about the genome we know that

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,319
the human genome is very big but only a

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,120
very very small portion around 1%

58
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,879
actually encod for proteins so the

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,760
coding region is actually a tiny portion

60
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,760
of the genome and the rest of the genome

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,200
is actually non-coding and then within

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,000
the non-coding genome we have in human

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,879
genome around a million regulatory

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,480
elements such as promoters and enhancers

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,120
and these elements are actually uh

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,560
playing a very big role regulating the

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,280
expression of genes depending on which

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,400
genes are expressed in which cells so as

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
a result it has become one of the

70
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,599
central questions of modern day U

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,640
genomics and you know even biology to

72
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,040
study how the AC activities and

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,159
functions of promoters and enhancers are

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,200
regulated and I think to this is a

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,280
really broad question so really to start

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,560
think about uh to answer this I think

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,200
it's important to think about what

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,680
happens on the molecular level we know

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,959
that the majority of the genome is

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,560
actually very inaccessible chatin

81
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,360
meaning that they are very Compact and

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,319
they're you know packed with

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,799
nisms but these small regions like the

84
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,439
uh not sure if I can see M curser uh

85
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,799
these promoters and enhancers when

86
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,680
they're active they look different

87
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,439
because if you zoom into one of these

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,599
regions you see of course you have ncms

89
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:42,239
on two sides of the region but you also

90
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,799
have in the middle a nucleis free region

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
usually devoid of

92
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,920
nucleis and this region is much more

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,480
open than the the rest of the The genome

94
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,079
and just because there's new nucleis

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,720
there now you can have transission

96
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,720
factors uh

97
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,599
comb and then uh when you have the right

98
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,239
combination of transition factors they

99
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,599
recruit uh the in poies and I want to

100
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,319
emphasize here that uh every

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,120
transmission Factor only buy a very

102
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,599
small subset of all of the uh C regory

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,519
elements and then every C regory element

104
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,760
is only Bound by a specific selective uh

105
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,560
combination of TFS so it is this

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,239
combinatorial and selective Bing that

107
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,359
eventually determines the expression of

108
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,680
our genes I also want to emphasize the

109
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,400
size of things okay this regulatory

110
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,880
elements so let's say a one promoter

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
enhancer is usually around a few hundred

112
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
base pairs wide

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,600
every nucleis will occupy the space of

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,120
around 150 base part of DNA you know

115
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,800
from ranging from 100 to 200 and TFS are

116
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,680
so much smaller transission factors

117
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,919
usually bind 10 to 20 base parts of DNA

118
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,960
and ares are slightly

119
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,960
larger so as you can see that

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,800
every every C is in fact like an intra

121
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,080
molecular machine right with all of

122
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,280
these parts working together to

123
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,840
determine this function so something

124
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,880
that we been wondering in the lab is

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,039
what is The Binding dynamics of all of

126
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,520
these factors how do they dynamically

127
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,960
work together to determine the function

128
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,880
of the C and I want to give a special

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,759
highlight to these little guys here so

130
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,919
transtion factors we know that transtion

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,240
factors are truly the master Regulators

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,800
of self fate and function they're so

133
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,680
important we know that with the overe

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,319
expression just a few TFS we can

135
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,319
actually convert one sulfate completely

136
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,840
to another sufate so for example if you

137
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,199
over Express uh the these four TFS the

138
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,759
yamanaka factors can convert a fiber

139
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,280
blast to induced plent stem cell or if

140
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,120
you over Express these three TFS in the

141
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,319
bottom you can convert a fiber blast to

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,759
a heart muscle cell a cardom monoy so

143
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,840
it's very cool and as we know that they

144
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,919
also play a big role in disease

145
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,000
Development A lot of times you see

146
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,199
disregulation of TF driving the

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
progression of disease and of course

148
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,919
during natural development n

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,400
differentiation uh you also see TFS

150
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
everywhere so in our lab we really like

151
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,560
to use use the hematopoetic system as

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,520
the model system uh just because you you

153
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,960
can see from the hematop stem cells here

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,800
uh to the progenitor cells in the middle

155
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,759
and to the more differentiated cells on

156
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,000
the bottom there are so many self fate

157
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,199
decision points and almost every one of

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
them is governed by a specific set of

159
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,599
TFS so you can see TFS are everywhere

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,319
and they're so important in biology so

161
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,960
as a result for decades people have

162
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
really wanted to figure out where HTF

163
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,720
binds which findinding size are in the

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,840
genome and what Target genes they

165
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,039
regulate and although people have been

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,120
trying this for decades as it turn out

167
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,960
even up until today if you want to

168
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,160
systematically map The Binding of every

169
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,400
TF in the genome it is still very

170
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
challenging so people have developed you

171
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,160
know a bunch of different methods to

172
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,560
solve this problem uh chipstick is

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,000
considered to be the gold standard of uh

174
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,440
a mapping TF binding basically you use a

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,680
antibody against your TF to pull down

176
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,639
the TF along with the genomic DNA that's

177
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,560
Bound by the TF and you sequence that

178
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,120
part of the DNA and you know uh which

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,680
regions of the G genome are bound um but

180
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,360
as you can imagine every TF requires a

181
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,800
different antibody and then not every TF

182
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,240
is a good antibody so this this method

183
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,520
although it's very accurate it

184
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,240
definitely lowers the number of TF you

185
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,800
can study usually you can only do a few

186
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,400
TFS at a

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,160
time another way to map transmission

188
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,680
Factor binding site is through

189
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,879
computation methods and uh just to give

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,560
you one example we know that uh

191
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,319
transmission factors when they buy to

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,479
the genome they recognize a specific DNA

193
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,440
sequence every TF recognize a different

194
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,120
uh DNA sequence we call it the TF

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,000
recognition Motif or just short for TF

196
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,479
Motif and then we also know that TFS

197
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
mostly bind to open regions of the

198
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,759
genome like the active promoters and

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,360
enhancers so a thing that people have

200
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,720
been doing is that they scan the DNA

201
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,520
sequence in those promoters and

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,840
enhancers for the presence of those

203
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,360
motifs and they say oh this is a

204
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,360
promoter I scan a DNA sequence I found

205
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,599
oh there's a recognition Motif by this

206
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,159
TF so it's probably Bound by this TF and

207
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,599
as you can imagine this is lower

208
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,560
accuracy because in fact a lot of the

209
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:19,199
places with the TF multif are actually

210
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,759
not bound by the TF uh and uh but this

211
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,479
eventually allows you to study a higher

212
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,479
number of TFS uh so as you can see the

213
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,759
the need for the field is actually to

214
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,400
develop a new method that can give you

215
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,440
both accur mapping but also allows you

216
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,880
to study a much larger number of

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,120
transmission

218
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,680
factors so that's actually the central

219
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,719
goal of our project we want to develop a

220
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,039
technology to accurately map the The

221
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,120
genome wi binding of a very large number

222
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,480
of transission factors ideally hundreds

223
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,800
or even a more than a thousands and we

224
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,000
know the TFS have interplay with u with

225
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,839
nucleis so we also want to be able to

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,920
map The Binding of nucleis at the same

227
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,440
time in the genome so how do we do this

228
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,680
uh we decided to use a taxic

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,360
footprinting uh and let me just explain

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,360
a little bit how this works so for those

231
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,959
who are not familiar with a taxic a

232
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,160
taxic is a method to measure uh

233
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,519
chromatine accessibility basically to

234
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,200
figure out which parts of the chromatine

235
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,160
uh are uh open and accessible and we do

236
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,720
this by treating chromatine with an

237
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,240
enzyme called uh tn5 which is a

238
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,000
transposes what TMI does is that TMI

239
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,440
will cut chromatine to create double St

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,160
brakes and liate sequencing adapters at

241
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,920
the same time to the end of the cuts and

242
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,920
then the enzyme has a really nice

243
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,440
property that it only goes to the open

244
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,839
regions of the CHR like the promoters

245
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,079
and enhancer and cut those regions and

246
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,480
then for the rest of the genome it

247
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,240
doesn't really cut so when you sequence

248
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,480
the ends of the the resulting fragments

249
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
and map them back to the genome you get

250
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,200
a track like this so this track

251
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
represents the cutting density and you

252
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,279
can see that for the majority of the

253
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,200
genome for example like this region you

254
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,079
get very low cutting Den because they're

255
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,000
packed with nucle and the enzyme is

256
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
having a hard time cutting it but you

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,800
see very small parts of the genome like

258
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,800
this one this one this one having very

259
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
high cutting density because they're

260
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,959
open regions without nucleis and enzym

261
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,000
is having a good time cutting them so

262
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,880
this is a taxi you can see basically

263
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,640
what it tells you is where the promoters

264
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,480
are and where the enhancers are in the

265
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,000
genome so with fopr we use the same

266
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,519
experiment same data but look at it at a

267
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,640
much higher resolution so what we do is

268
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,000
that we would zoom in into each one of

269
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,160
those regions like I said There usually

270
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,079
a few hundred base pair wide and we

271
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,079
quantify this cutting at single base

272
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,600
pair resolution and then when you do

273
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,200
that you'll realize within every

274
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,800
so-called open region uh The Cutting is

275
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
not uniform you get ups and downs and

276
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,880
then you'll see that the positions that

277
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,200
are bound by uh DNA binding proteins

278
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,320
like TFS just because the protein

279
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,279
sitting on DNA it's protecting that

280
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,959
short stretch of DNA from enzimatic

281
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,920
cutting so for example this part if you

282
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,600
see the cursor uh this part underneath

283
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,880
the TF is protected so it's showing a

284
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,560
lower than expected cutting density

285
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,880
compared to the two flanks and then you

286
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,920
will see a valley like a like a dip in

287
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,519
your signal and it kind of looks like

288
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,519
when you step onto the stand you leave a

289
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,160
footprint right so we call this a method

290
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,480
footprinting and call the shape like

291
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,160
that value the footprint of the DNA

292
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,920
binding TF um and then the data is very

293
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,639
noisy but if you have a good statistical

294
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,120
model you can actually detect or

295
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,240
evaluate how significant this depletion

296
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,200
of cutting is and then you can give

297
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
every position a footprint score and

298
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,160
then you will see that the positions

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,399
with higher scores represent The Binding

300
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,839
of an object physically protecting that

301
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,440
piece of DNA and like we said before

302
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,200
every TF recognize a pretty specific DNA

303
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,720
sequence TF Motif so once you know

304
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,320
there's something bound here you can

305
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,600
examine the DNA sequence underneath and

306
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,639
say oh now I know this is more likely

307
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,639
Bound by this TF and not that TF so you

308
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,680
can assign each footprint to a specific

309
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,680
Tif and uh if this works uh it would

310
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,480
allow us to accurately track the bun of

311
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,680
both nucleis and a lot of different TFS

312
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,079
with one single axic

313
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,240
experiment so we uh started the project

314
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,440
and uh try to figure out how to do this

315
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,760
and realize one thing that's very

316
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,279
interesting was that uh imagine you have

317
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,959
a toxic data set you see all of those uh

318
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,040
open regions you zoom into one of them

319
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,920
and what you see is that the footprints

320
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,720
really come in various different sizes

321
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,880
just because the objects are different

322
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,199
sizes theisms uh for example like this

323
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,720
one oops the nucs are very big like I

324
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:43,639
said it covers around 150 base pairs of

325
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,880
DNA so it would leave a very wide

326
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,440
footprint but the transmiss factors they

327
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,240
only binds like 10 to 20 base parts of

328
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,720
DNA so leave a very narrow footprint and

329
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,120
what we realize is that uh you can

330
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,760
actually detect The Binding of all of

331
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,199
these different objects

332
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,680
simultaneously uh just by scanning

333
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,680
through different window sizes when you

334
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,839
run foot

335
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,600
printing for example if you use a very

336
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,959
large window to detect the center versus

337
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,639
two flanks depletion of cutting and you

338
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,199
scan it through the this whole region

339
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,680
you will see the signal the footprint

340
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,399
signal of a large object here and a

341
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,480
object here uh corresponding to the

342
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,120
nisms but when you scan through this

343
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,000
region with a very narrow window uh like

344
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,560
this one you will specifically pick up

345
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,880
the signal of a small object filtering

346
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,440
out the larger objects so you can do

347
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,639
this you know across a whole range of

348
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,800
different window sizes and we call this

349
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,800
multikill for printing because it allows

350
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,320
you to separately detect the The Binding

351
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
of uh objects with different sizes so

352
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,519
when you stack the results together you

353
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,240
can get a map like this where on the

354
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,959
x-axis you see the genomic locations of

355
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,160
each object on the y- AIS you see the

356
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,240
physical size of the object and the

357
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,399
higher up you go on the y- axis when you

358
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,440
see a signal the bigger the object so

359
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,839
essentially uh what this gives you is

360
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,079
something almost like a you know

361
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,920
molecular level microscope that allows

362
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,880
you to uh resolve the local organization

363
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,040
of chromatine you will see a big thing

364
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,920
here a middle thing here and a smaller

365
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,160
thing here so um does this really work

366
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,839
we first the first thing we tested was

367
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,600
simulated data uh so what we did was

368
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,440
that very simple we simulated Footprints

369
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,399
of objects with different sizes and

370
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,800
different shapes uh in the computer uh

371
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,680
and this of course will be much cleaner

372
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,680
than real data and then we run that

373
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,240
multiscale foot printing approach here

374
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,079
and you will get a result like this so

375
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,880
remember x- axis is where the objects

376
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:38,360
are Y axis shows the size and you

377
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,480
clearly see that with a very small

378
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,720
object like this one you will only

379
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,759
detect signal very low on the y- axis

380
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,680
using the the very narrow windows with a

381
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,480
very big object uh you will see signal

382
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,519
much higher up on the y- axis because

383
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,759
you're using the bigger windows and you

384
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,560
can even see that if your footprint is

385
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,839
having a weird shape you see a very

386
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,040
distinct pattern and this almost says

387
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,399
that the the footprint the multiscale

388
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,399
footprint pattern can be used as a

389
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,600
fingerprint of like how the DNA and the

390
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,920
protein

391
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,199
interacts and we're really encouraged by

392
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,839
the results so we decided to you know

393
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:15,720
test this on real data so we test it on

394
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,079
um a taxi data from a cell line hg2 and

395
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,000
just to show you one example region uh

396
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,639
this is a promoter uh around 800 base

397
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,519
pairs uh in this cancer cell line and

398
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,759
here on the multiscale pattern you can

399
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,920
see in the middle you have uh you have a

400
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,920
a footprint that's very low on the y

401
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,199
axis meaning that it's a small thing and

402
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,440
on two sides you see two very um strong

403
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,519
Footprints much higher on the y- axis

404
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,920
meaning that they're big big things so

405
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,959
if you align this to the reference

406
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,399
genome you realize the center object is

407
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,720
right on top of a ctcf motif at the

408
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,399
center of a ctcf chip SE Peak meaning

409
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,199
that is very likely to be a ctcf by name

410
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,160
and two things on the two sides are

411
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,279
aligning perfectly with hism chip data

412
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,000
meaning that they are nucs so you can

413
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,560
already see that it res resolves the

414
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,040
local organization of chitine that you

415
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,079
get big things and small things and we

416
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,480
explore this uh a lot and realize the

417
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,720
objects with different sizes different

418
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,560
shapes or even different binding string

419
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,759
all leave very distinct footprint so

420
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,680
it's like every object has its own

421
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,959
fingerprint in this pattern and also

422
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,759
very interestingly I really really want

423
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,279
to emphasize is that a lot of TFS don't

424
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,319
leave Footprints so either because they

425
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,319
bind the in too transiently were too

426
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:33,279
weakly that don't really protect DNA

427
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,120
Enough From The Cutting and they're

428
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,399
invisible TF we don't see them in our

429
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,720
data so when when I first saw this I was

430
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,279
really frustrated uh but later I'll tell

431
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,600
you how we found out a way to map The

432
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,720
Binding of the invisible TFS through a

433
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,800
rather unexpected uh

434
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,079
approach so another question that we

435
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,800
were wondering at the at the time was

436
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,279
that now that we can detect The Binding

437
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,240
of these different proteins what is the

438
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,519
genomic syntax governing their

439
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,360
organization in other words we always

440
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,759
say everything you need is written in

441
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,959
the DNA sequence does the DNA how much

442
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,480
does the DNA sequence determine where

443
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,240
the nucleis are where the proteins are

444
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,240
and we try to answer this question by

445
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,360
actually doing something very

446
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,760
straightforward which is to train a deep

447
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,039
learning model that uses only DNA

448
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,760
sequence as the input and try to ask the

449
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,919
model to predict Lo the local multiscale

450
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,120
footprint patterns basically saying can

451
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,679
you just by looking at the DNA sequence

452
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,919
predict where the nisms are where the

453
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,320
the TFS are if this model can even be

454
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,960
trained or like have some performance

455
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,320
that means there's useful information to

456
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,240
learn from DNA right uh so we try this

457
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,440
and it worked surprisingly well so I

458
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,360
will show you one example result uh here

459
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,600
this is one promoter in the same s line

460
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,520
and then on the top you see the observe

461
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,600
the footprints from a tax seek you see

462
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:58,640
uh one nucleis uh

463
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,960
here uh and another nucleis uh here and

464
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,840
then in the middle you see one two three

465
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,760
I guess I can use this cursor it's

466
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:10,520
better uh you can see one TF 2 TF 3 TF 4

467
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,880
TF 5 TF some so the TFS are in between

468
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,679
the nisms and then uh this region is not

469
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,000
was not included in the training set so

470
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,080
the model has not seen this region

471
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,240
during training but once the model is

472
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,120
trained on other regions of the uh the

473
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,159
genome and then you just give the model

474
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,120
the DNA sequence within this region and

475
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,679
ask it what where do you think the the

476
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,520
objects are the model will predict uh

477
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,240
the pattern in the bottom on the bottom

478
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,679
where it will say I think there's a nism

479
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,919
here I think there's a nism here exactly

480
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,400
matching the actual observed pattern and

481
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,039
the model actually knows where the the

482
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,320
TFS will be like one two three four five

483
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,039
so that was really remarkable and kind

484
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,880
of surprising to us uh but the coolest

485
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,159
thing is not to make the predictions

486
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,360
because you know we already have the

487
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,159
footprints from the observe data the

488
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,919
most exciting opportunity was to

489
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,280
actually ask the model to explain how it

490
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,360
was making the prediction you can ask

491
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,280
the model how which parts of the

492
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,360
sequences you're looking at to make

493
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,240
these predictions and then we do this by

494
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,240
calculating something called a sequence

495
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,960
attribution score for each base pair

496
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,159
basically it's a score that evaluates

497
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,720
the importance or the contribution of

498
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,320
each base pair to the final prediction

499
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,799
if a base is very important you'll have

500
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,440
a high score uh so if you do that for

501
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,039
the whole region uh the mod you'll get a

502
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,080
track like this so this is a track of

503
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,880
the score and you will see that the

504
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,760
model is actually not using oh sorry the

505
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,360
model is not using every single base

506
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,480
pair to make prediction it is actually

507
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,159
prioritizing to use you know these

508
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,240
spaces these spaces these spaces to make

509
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,039
predictions and if you look at what

510
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,480
those short stretches of DNA are they

511
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,280
are actually exactly TF binding motives

512
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,080
so for some reason the model through

513
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,400
learning is be is able to capture um the

514
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,480
TF the arrangement of TF motifs and use

515
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,159
them to predict where the objects are

516
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,400
and and uh even cooler thing is that

517
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,120
instead of looking at the whole region

518
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,400
you can of course focus on specific

519
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:10,120
objects so let's say uh this footprint

520
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,880
Alpha uh comparing to chips we know that

521
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,559
Alpha is on top of a ctcf binding size

522
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,240
so this is very likely

523
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,240
ctcf uh if you ask the model how are you

524
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,919
predicting that there will be a

525
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,440
footprint there at Alpha the model says

526
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,720
for this one I'm just looking at these

527
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,000
baces which is exactly the ctcf motif uh

528
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,559
looking at the motif I know there will

529
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,400
be a TF which is kind of trivial but uh

530
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,200
what's interesting is that for footprint

531
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,640
beta if you ask the model how are you

532
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,440
predicting Forint beta uh the model will

533
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,520
say oh Forint beta you know we know that

534
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,880
it's uh on top of the n22 uh bing side

535
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,600
the model says I'm looking at the nf22

536
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,280
motif but also this motif of nfyb next

537
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,520
to nf22 I'm using both of them to

538
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,159
predict the binding uh the presence of

539
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,120
this footprint and that's very

540
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,679
interesting because fyb is one of those

541
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,159
and in this case one of those invisible

542
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,679
TFS if you look at the observed or the

543
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,320
predicted there's no a visible footprint

544
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,240
here so meaning that nyb itself probably

545
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,120
binds DNA not strongly enough to leave a

546
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,120
footprint but the model has seen enough

547
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,279
sequence footprint dependency like

548
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,799
relationships it is able to capture that

549
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,720
this Motif has a dependency with this

550
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,600
nearby visible footprint and it's thus

551
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:32,360
able to uh kind of like capture the the

552
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,120
finding event of f b and then uh

553
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,039
similarly you can also ask the model how

554
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,039
predicting the presence of this nucleis

555
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,080
the model will say for this nucleis I'm

556
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,360
using this sequence this nfyb binding

557
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,679
site and this Nerf one binding site uh

558
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,919
this Motif to predict and that's also

559
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,799
really interesting because this Motif is

560
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,640
like 400 base pairs away from the

561
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,520
nucleis so the model is capturing some

562
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,000
long range dependency between the

563
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,360
objects in the same

564
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,919
region and then um

565
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,240
as you can see that we keep saying that

566
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,400
oh the model keep picks up these short

567
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,720
DNA uh sequences that are actually the

568
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,080
TF motifs and we think they could be

569
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,600
really Bound by the TF but we don't

570
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,840
really like at the time we didn't know

571
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,919
whether that was true are these

572
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,760
positions with the high scores really

573
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,720
Bound by TFS we really need to uh

574
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,279
Benchmark against ground truth data of

575
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,520
TF binding which is chipseek so

576
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,760
something you can do is that let's say

577
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,039
ask a quick question how how are how is

578
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,760
your model predicting where the

579
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,279
nucleosomes are how is the model

580
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,000
predicting where the nucleosomes are

581
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:38,240
yeah because all of the transcription

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,880
factors are based on sequence right

583
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,840
right but is

584
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,440
predicting where the nucleus that means

585
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,720
the nucleis the positioning of the nucis

586
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,640
is sequence dependent oh yeah because

587
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,159
like the I I think the our our

588
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,120
understanding of this process is that

589
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:59,679
where the nism is it's actually shaped

590
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,080
by both where the TFS are and of course

591
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,520
you cannot see this thing here but like

592
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,799
the nucis remodelers but where the nucis

593
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,039
remodel are is still to some extent like

594
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,760
related to where the TFS are so uh

595
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:15,320
basically uh we've seen this in in some

596
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,120
examples where uh you know the model

597
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,880
looks at certain TF binding sides and

598
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,679
then it knows the nucis should be

599
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,200
exactly these many base pairs away from

600
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,480
those TFS and in silico you can you know

601
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,279
in the computer you can change your

602
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,760
sequence by moving this TF to the side

603
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:32,559
like to the left or to the right we're

604
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,880
upating the TF and the model if you do

605
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,279
that the model give it a slightly

606
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,400
different prediction we say the mo now

607
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,559
the nucleis would move to the side where

608
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,400
the nucleis would disappear so that

609
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,240
means that there's a dependency between

610
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,000
where the TFS are and where the nucleis

611
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,679
are and I think that is to some extent

612
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,600
know like certain TFS really like to

613
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,760
bind um at a certain distance to nucleis

614
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,440
some are like right next to the nism

615
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,640
some are like at a certain distance uh

616
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,320
and I think but but I really need to

617
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,840
emphasize that the model is learning um

618
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,159
correlation so whether this is the nucis

619
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,559
is determine where the TFS are what the

620
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
TFS are determined with the nule like

621
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:12,440
the causality is still needs to be

622
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,440
established through

623
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,799
experiments uh so uh we really want to

624
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,600
know whether the sites highlighted by

625
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,600
the sequence attribution scores are

626
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,440
really Bound by the TFS so something you

627
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,480
can do is that let's say you have a TF

628
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,880
you're interested in uh you have its

629
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,000
Motif you scan it through the whole

630
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,559
genome and you'll see a lot of motif uh

631
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,640
sites and then when you compare when you

632
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,279
overlap with chipseek you realize a lot

633
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,120
of the sites have chips signal so they

634
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,039
are bound sites a lot of sites with the

635
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,240
motif but they don't have chip signal

636
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,600
meaning that they're Unbound multi site

637
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,200
they're not really used by the TF and we

638
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,960
did that and if you compare the sites

639
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,120
that are bound and Unbound if you look

640
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,320
at their sequence attribution scores uh

641
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,200
you see something like this so for

642
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,440
example on the left you see atf3

643
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,640
and then every so this he map every row

644
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,640
is a individual Motif s all the sides on

645
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,760
the left have chip signal and you can

646
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,159
see that uh the color here represents

647
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,720
the sequence attribution scores so you

648
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,799
can see the bound sides really do have

649
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,120
much higher sequence attribution scores

650
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,559
the model knows that they are bound and

651
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,520
then the Unbound SES overall they don't

652
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,240
have chip and they also have very uh

653
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,399
much lower uh sequence attribution

654
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,919
scores so for some reason although all

655
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,039
of these sites have a motif the model

656
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,720
was able able to by looking at nearby

657
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:34,600
sequence context figure out which sites

658
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,960
are used by the TF which sites are not

659
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,320
used by the TF so this gives you a very

660
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,720
good TF findinding predictor and then I

661
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,520
also want to highlight y1 because y1 is

662
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,320
one of those invisible TFS you

663
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,320
absolutely don't see its footprint at

664
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,640
least in your data but just by learning

665
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,840
the dependency with nearby uh visible

666
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,720
objects the model is able to figure out

667
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,399
that these Motif sides are bound and

668
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,200
these Motif sides are Unbound and then

669
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:01,880
we realize that you can do a simple

670
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,840
transformation to convert the sequence

671
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,799
attribution scores to a final TF binding

672
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,240
score and that TF binding score will

673
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,159
give you a really nice prediction of

674
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,279
which sites are bound by which TFS so

675
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,000
data Benchmark using a larger set of

676
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,880
chipstick data compared to the previous

677
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,559
methods developed in the past 10 to

678
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,039
20ish years uh to predict TF finding and

679
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,799
then you can see that the method on the

680
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,320
right is our method it's definitely

681
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:31,720
showing improved accuracy in predicting

682
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,520
TF using chipseek as ground truth so

683
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,000
this gives us a really nice TF binding

684
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,880
predictor and we were really encouraged

685
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,600
by the results and now we're thinking

686
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,520
can we apply this to actually track the

687
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,399
Dynamics of TF binding through a real

688
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,720
biological process for example

689
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:49,320
differentiation and here I want to say

690
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,200
that it is such a nice opportunity to be

691
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,720
able to footprint with a taxi because a

692
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,240
taxic is uniquely adapted into single

693
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,679
cell platforms there are so many single

694
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,919
cell axic methods uh compared to you

695
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,799
know DNA seek and m& seek so the unique

696
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,679
opportunity here is that you can with a

697
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,440
single cell attack data run for printing

698
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,399
for every single cell type or every

699
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,399
single cell State and you can compare

700
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:15,320
the differences so let me just show you

701
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:18,559
one example uh in our lab we generated

702
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,200
this um human bone marrow sharti data

703
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,200
which which is basically multi-m of both

704
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,039
a taxic and RC in the same individual

705
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,640
cells and we sequence around 900,000

706
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,720
cells so you can see the map on the left

707
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,200
and then we covered most of the major

708
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,880
cell types in hematop poises you can see

709
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,159
here are the hematop stem cells and they

710
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,320
can differentiate into the RR lineage

711
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,880
the B cell lineage uh the myoid lineage

712
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,320
and covering most of the major cell

713
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,240
types so what you can do here is that

714
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,320
you can let's say take all of these

715
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,840
let's say a few thousand cells in the HC

716
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,880
State aggregate their data so you get a

717
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,880
very deep track of the The Cutting

718
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,559
density it can run fo Printing and the

719
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,000
de learning model on it to figure out

720
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,679
where the TFS are where the nisms are

721
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,760
and then you take a little step forward

722
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,120
like here you aggregate all of these

723
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,159
cells and then you do the same thing you

724
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,799
get the TF binding pattern and take one

725
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,919
step forward one step forward you can do

726
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,720
this iteratively and eventually you'll

727
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,640
be able to figure out the TF binding and

728
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,399
nucleis binding pattern across all of

729
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,600
the different cell States so to show you

730
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,840
what the results might look like uh this

731
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,440
is showing one promoter the GM pe1

732
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,519
promoter P1 itself expresses also a

733
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,200
transition Factor here every row is a

734
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,320
cell state so you can think of it as a

735
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,039
tiny group of cells you know in a little

736
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,640
corner In This U map and we have 1,000

737
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,440
different cell States generated uh

738
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,799
sampled from that um data set so you get

739
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,960
1,000

740
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,360
rows every column is a single base pair

741
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,480
so we're showing the 800 base pair uh

742
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,279
region within that promoter and then the

743
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,640
color in the heat map in the middle

744
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,000
shows the pred TF finding score so if

745
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,279
you see a red area that means that

746
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,840
position is bound by a TF and then if

747
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:08,679
you see blue that means this position is

748
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,840
not bound so what you see immediately is

749
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,159
that even in this same region you get

750
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,480
several different distinct patterns of T

751
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,279
binding across the cell types right so

752
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,519
for example if you look at the myoid

753
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,799
cells the Milo cells is where this Gene

754
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,519
is very highly expressed you see

755
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,039
multiple TFS Bound in here like every

756
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,880
red stripe is a TF the strongest stripe

757
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,399
with strongest predicted TF binding is

758
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,559
in fact P1 itself so it turns out that

759
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,440
this Gene expresses a TF the TF comes

760
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,519
back and binds its own promoter to form

761
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,360
an auto regulation Loop and if you look

762
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:49,159
at another cell type cells um you lose

763
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,919
all of this binding but you gain binding

764
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,320
here which is not bound in the M cell

765
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,640
you gain binding here if you look what

766
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,760
it is it is scatter one and it's

767
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,799
actually very well known that P the spi1

768
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,000
G and gatan Gene fight with each other

769
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,720
their enemies uh during

770
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,799
differentiation if P if spi1 wins the

771
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,720
cells going to myoid and if Gan wins the

772
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,000
cells going to erythroid so you can see

773
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,919
this enemy of spi1 coming here and

774
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,880
inhibiting its own enemy repressing its

775
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,919
expression and it's interesting if you

776
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,120
look at the bar on the right which is

777
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,640
the overall accessibility like the total

778
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,720
number of cutting you see within this

779
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,480
region uh you can see that all of these

780
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,880
details will be lost if you just do uh

781
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,559
if you just calculate accessibility so

782
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,840
essentially this TF patterns cannot be

783
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,480
detected uh by doing the traditional way

784
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,600
of analyzing attack data which is

785
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,840
calling the Peaks you know promoters and

786
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,679
enhancers and just counting how many uh

787
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,039
reads you have in those

788
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,399
regions so uh like we mentioned before

789
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,399
instead of looking at all of the cell

790
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:57,399
States you can of course also just focus

791
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,720
on one specific lineage let's say the

792
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,480
eror L

793
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,880
and now you can take the pseuds or like

794
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,279
the small cell groups from the beginning

795
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,159
of differentiation to the end and align

796
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,760
them sort them through pseudo time and

797
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,919
then you get something like this so here

798
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm showing one enhancer that's very

799
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,279
important for regulating hemoglobin

800
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,120
genes the H3 uh enhancer and then from

801
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,440
top to bottom you still get different

802
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,760
cell States but ranging from the stem

803
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,919
cells to middle of the lineage to more

804
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,799
later like differentiated cells and

805
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,840
again I'm showing a 00 base pair region

806
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:34,559
so you can see that the color represent

807
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,600
the TF finding score you can see that um

808
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,440
the TFS start from very low binding and

809
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,039
they gradually gain binding during

810
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,880
differentiation some TFS gain binding

811
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,519
much later like this one you know it's

812
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,320
starts to bind much later on but there

813
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,559
are also TFS that start binding very

814
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,440
early like this one very early during

815
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,639
differentiation you can see binding and

816
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,480
the Rd TFS are actually G one and T one

817
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:58,559
which are exactly the master Regulators

818
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,039
of eor differentiation

819
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,799
and like I mentioned before when you do

820
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,200
the multiscale you not only get the TFS

821
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,000
but you also get the nisms right so you

822
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,360
can try to see where the nisms are bound

823
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,960
in this region across differentiation

824
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,519
and you get a map like this so here you

825
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,360
can see that at the beginning of

826
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,600
differentiation you get you know kind of

827
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,120
fuzzy patterns of nisms and this Center

828
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,559
region is not really nucleis free uh but

829
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,279
during differentiation you start to get

830
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:27,039
more face nucleis like more well

831
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,279
positioned nucleis one two and three and

832
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,440
then as the cells differentiate the

833
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,600
nisms actually move around like this

834
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,039
nucis uh moves to the right this nucis

835
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,679
moves to the left and they increase the

836
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,440
space in the middle so they you're

837
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,320
getting a bigger and bigger nism free

838
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,600
region in the middle and that allows for

839
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,639
more TF to be bound so this actually you

840
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,120
know you can see how AC is established

841
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:54,880
step by step across differentiation and

842
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,840
we thought that was like a really cool

843
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,320
opportunity and additionally we also

844
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,000
want to see whether this method can be

845
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,799
applied to disease like can you get a

846
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,639
healthy sample a disease sample call

847
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,120
where the footprints are and then

848
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,600
compare them to see which TFS have

849
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,320
changed during disease and then uh our

850
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,840
lab is very interesed in aging so we did

851
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,720
this in the Aging context where we get

852
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,679
uh hetic stem cells from Young mice and

853
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,919
old mice and we we did uh 10x volum on

854
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,960
it and then uh called Footprints using

855
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:26,200
our method and R the de model and this

856
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,360
is our data set you can see you have the

857
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,559
stem cells here the different iate into

858
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,240
some of the downstream lineages but if

859
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,480
we only focus on the stem cells you see

860
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,880
that the young cells are here the old

861
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,080
cells are here so they really take

862
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,639
different cell states in the state space

863
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,159
and we ran the previous analysis we

864
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:43,440
mentioned so I'm not going to go over

865
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,639
those right now but I want to highlight

866
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,880
something that we haven't mentioned

867
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:50,960
before which is to identify the novo TF

868
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,679
motives so if you still remember we said

869
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,480
uh when we asked the model to explain

870
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,960
its prediction you can get this track of

871
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,360
sequence important scores and even

872
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,120
without knowing you know without having

873
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,639
a previously defined Motif database you

874
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,799
can just look at this track and say oh I

875
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:09,040
think I know this is very likely a TF

876
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,440
Motif because it's highlighted this is

877
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,760
very likely a TF Motif and then you can

878
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,560
score use the TF binding score to

879
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,720
compare is this Motif more bound or less

880
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,040
Bound in the disease store healthy uh

881
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,679
cell States and then you will know which

882
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,040
TF go up during uh aging and which TF

883
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,919
going down during aging and then when do

884
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,919
this you will see that you know this

885
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:35,040
this plot shows like the which TFS go up

886
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:38,000
which TFS which motifs go down you see a

887
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,919
lot of changes during aging and when you

888
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,960
call that denal Motif some of them when

889
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,359
you compare to a known Motif database

890
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,240
they can be very well matched to a

891
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,480
previously known Motif so you know what

892
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,720
it is so for example we know uh AP1 TFS

893
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,919
like false and then RS G they go up dur

894
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,359
aging and then we see some TS like y11

895
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:59,640
Nerf one they go down during aging but

896
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,880
also see a lot of motifs like this motif

897
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,400
number eight here I'm not sure you can

898
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,200
see this this motif number eight here uh

899
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,760
we see this Motif being picked up by the

900
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,280
model and it its binding goes up during

901
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,599
aging but it doesn't really match any

902
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,880
known Motif in The Motif database so

903
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,160
we're like is could this be a new TF

904
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,280
that nobody knows about then you know

905
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,800
that's having a completely new Motif and

906
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,880
we looked into this and realized that

907
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,839
was not the case what what's happening

908
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,119
is that these unknown motifs are

909
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:31,599
actually composite motifs so they're

910
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,760
consisting of multiple know motifs you

911
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,200
know concatenated together so for

912
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,760
example these motifs all go up dur aging

913
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,440
and then you can see that for example

914
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,599
this top one is actually ad Motif and a

915
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,720
rank Motif combined together then this

916
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,480
one is also add some runks but the runks

917
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,520
is flipped in the other strand and then

918
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,760
you also see a lot of like s add timer

919
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,079
motives G at timer motives s motives so

920
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,680
it seems like the Deep learning model is

921
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,920
picking up the Partnerships between TFS

922
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,079
when they bind but at the time we didn't

923
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,319
really know is this you know really

924
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,560
physiological partnership between TFS do

925
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:11,480
they actually

926
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,400
interact uh and interestingly we looked

927
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,119
into literature and found that some of

928
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,640
these composite motifs are supported by

929
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,440
uh structural data like Crystal

930
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,560
structures or crowm structures and then

931
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,280
for example this motif number 10 matches

932
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,440
exactly the DNA sequence used in this

933
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,560
structure this is you can found it in uh

934
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,599
you can find it in pdb and you can see

935
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,240
that the D is flipped but you can see

936
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:39,319
that the rungs one binds its own Motif

937
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,640
S1 binds its own Motif and rung one

938
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:43,359
actually has this Linker the flips over

939
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,359
with the extra domain that interacts

940
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,599
with s and then previous Studies have

941
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:52,079
found that S1 actually inhibits itself

942
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,200
through Auto inhibitory domain but this

943
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,119
interaction with rung one relieves that

944
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:00,240
in inhibition so now S1 is more active

945
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,319
so this is indeed a phys physiologically

946
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,040
relevant um interaction that we're

947
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,240
picking up by the model here and of

948
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,760
course in the pdb you also see S1 S1

949
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,160
dier very similarly matching I think uh

950
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,760
this and then it's also relieving the

951
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,800
auto inhibition of

952
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,920
s but in our data uh in addition to

953
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,400
these two structures we see a lot of

954
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,680
different orientations and

955
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,960
configurations of the motives especially

956
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,200
between S1 and R one so for example all

957
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,640
of these configurations they go up in

958
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,400
aging they have a ranks they have an X

959
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,440
but have different distances and they

960
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,920
have different

961
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,440
orientations and then we're like all

962
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,480
most of these didn't really have like

963
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,200
structural data are they physiologically

964
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,640
relevant just out of curiosity We

965
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,560
compare it to Alpha fold so we use Alpha

966
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,359
fall 3 to predict what could be

967
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,760
happening so basically throwing that DNA

968
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,920
sequence throwing in those two TFS to

969
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,880
see whether Alpha fall is predicting

970
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,520
certain sort of U interaction and what's

971
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,280
kind of surprising was that Alpha fall

972
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,880
was actually predicting the exact same

973
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,400
type of uh interaction as turn here so

974
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,680
for example for moti 43 which is if you

975
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,000
can find it here you have uh rungs here

976
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,000
adds here and then you can see that

977
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,359
rungs is Alpha Four predicts that R will

978
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,800
bind its own

979
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:22,240
Motif and X will bind own Motif and Ron

980
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,520
still has this flexible Linker flipping

981
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,640
over to the other side of the with this

982
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,040
interaction domain that interacts with s

983
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,760
to remove his a inhibition and then this

984
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,240
is a totally uh different of

985
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,720
configuration Motif 61 which is this and

986
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,319
this you can see is much farther apart

987
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,920
but still runs with bind own Motif and

988
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:43,520
then flipping over through this Linker

989
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,119
interact with ads and this is all

990
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,839
consistent with the know data so it

991
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,560
seems that the Deep learning model

992
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,160
through learning the dep dependency

993
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,319
between DNA sequence and the for prints

994
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,160
it's capturing both known and novel TF

995
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:59,880
corporations uh but whether this plays a

996
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,720
role in aging we don't really know we

997
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,200
just see this going up does it have a

998
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,400
caal ro driving the Aging of the cell I

999
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,000
feel that's something that we still need

1000
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,640
to validate so just want to summarize uh

1001
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,319
with some TI messages uh so first of all

1002
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,160
we know that uh we developed this multi

1003
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:18,079
multiscale for printing method that

1004
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,440
detects the the DN binding factors of

1005
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,680
different V various sizes and kind of

1006
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,839
delineates the local organization of

1007
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,000
chatin and we trained a sequence to

1008
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,280
footprint model uh that kind the Cod the

1009
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,280
D in a sequence dependence of protein

1010
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,560
binding and with this you can highlight

1011
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,560
you know the positions that are more

1012
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,640
likely Bound by

1013
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,359
TFS and then combining for printing with

1014
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,079
single cell data you can actually look

1015
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:44,880
at every little corner of that state

1016
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,599
space and track how the protein binding

1017
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,640
Dynamics change across cell States like

1018
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,960
differentiation and uh we can apply this

1019
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,880
to aging or any other disease relevant

1020
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,040
uh context comparing healthy and not

1021
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,480
healthy to figure out what has changed

1022
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,720
uh across

1023
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,400
disease and eventually uh you can call

1024
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,200
the noal motives and capture some

1025
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,839
interesting interactions like

1026
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,599
Partnerships between TFS uh which could

1027
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,400
be uh useful for people studying like

1028
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,280
how TFS work

1029
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,680
together and I just want to mention that

1030
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,280
uh this is very recently online uh on

1031
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:24,280
nature actually just like a month ago

1032
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,440
and our lab has prepared a uh GitHub

1033
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,800
repository so we have all of the code

1034
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,240
and we uh we we implemented a um python

1035
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,160
package that's user friendly so if you

1036
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,480
really want to use this uh you can check

1037
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,000
out our GitHub repo and download our

1038
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,240
package and we also prepared a lot of uh

1039
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,680
tutorials to show you how to run this

1040
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,119
and we have tutorials to run this on

1041
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,720
single cell Tack and B attack so you can

1042
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,480
I highly encourage you to check it out

1043
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,160
uh and in the in the end I want to uh

1044
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,640
thank everyone in the lab especially

1045
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Jason and also uh my co colleagues of

1046
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,599
this project Max and r and Max was

1047
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,640
supposed to give a talk today but

1048
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:07,000
unfortunately um he's kind of sick today

1049
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,920
so uh and um also want to thank Sai and

1050
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,119
V who really played a big roles in the

1051
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,280
early phases of the project and our

1052
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,920
collaborators at the broad and also

1053
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,599
collaborators in the Wagers Lab at

1054
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,319
Harvard uh and I'll be happy to take any

1055
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,319
questions thank

1056
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:27,880
you thanks that was fantastic and I

1057
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,720
can't believe you did it all with hours

1058
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,319
notice and we even had someone drop in

1059
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,119
from outside to

1060
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,960
watch um yeah go ahead oh thank you for

1061
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,520
the great talk um so I just have one uh

1062
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,880
technical question so how deep do you

1063
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,160
have to sequence to in order to generate

1064
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,880
reliable uh data something like this

1065
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,800
yeah so that's a really good question um

1066
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,040
overall I think so first of all it

1067
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,760
depends on your data quality right you

1068
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,319
can imagine that if you have really good

1069
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,200
quality attack data you can get away

1070
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:04,160
with slightly feor reads uh and then

1071
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,599
overall I think you would start from you

1072
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,839
know 5 to 10 million fragments which is

1073
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,200
a good start and then the deeper you go

1074
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:12,760
the higher the quality usually when I

1075
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,160
think when people sequence bulk attack

1076
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,920
if it if they don't do full printing

1077
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,640
they probably sequence like one to two

1078
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,520
million reads something like that so

1079
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,640
this is slightly deeper than that but uh

1080
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,440
if you have really good TSS scores or

1081
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,880
like really good you know distinguish

1082
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,240
ability to distinguish

1083
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,440
accessible and not accessible critin I

1084
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,800
think you can get away with slightly

1085
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,680
less but more is better yeah uh so in in

1086
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,400
the context of the single cell taxic

1087
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:43,720
data then how many reads do you need uh

1088
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,760
per cell like fragment yeah so uh if you

1089
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,240
do the backup level calculation uh for a

1090
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:54,000
standard 10x multi uh data set I think

1091
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,760
you can get something like 20ish K reads

1092
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,079
per cell right so so 10 to 20 Kish well

1093
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,480
a good data set that 10 to 20K uh reads

1094
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,240
per per cell and then that means you

1095
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,440
probably need a few hundred cells to

1096
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,440
close a million close to a thousand

1097
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,280
cells to form a PUD that's like a few

1098
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:18,079
million reads right and then that would

1099
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,079
be enough for um doing a PUD box that's

1100
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,280
de enough for foot printing in the data

1101
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,800
set that we generated like the the bone

1102
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:28,960
marrow data set

1103
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:32,079
um like this one

1104
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,119
oops this one we sequenced we we try to

1105
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,079
go for higher number of cells so this

1106
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,760
one I think had lower um coverage per

1107
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,760
cell so like a few thousands so

1108
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,079
definitely not to 10 to 20, so we kind

1109
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,520
of have to suitable a little more cells

1110
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,920
to get enough coverage this one I think

1111
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,720
we did a few thousand cells per suit B

1112
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,440
but we have 900,000 in total so it's

1113
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:56,920
like easier one more question it's it's

1114
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,000
completely different but um So tm5 Pro

1115
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,960
uh uh

1116
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,400
transposes uh actually insert nine uh

1117
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,400
base pairs when they attach the adapters

1118
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,880
right right um so how do you deal with

1119
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,079
this you know artificial nine based

1120
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,640
pairs when you model or identify this

1121
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,559
footprint okay so for those who are not

1122
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:21,839
familiar with this how TMI works when it

1123
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,920
cuts I wish there's a way for me to draw

1124
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,839
uh draw on the

1125
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:31,680
B uh actually I'll just explain it uh so

1126
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,119
sorry so you have DNA tn5 sits on it and

1127
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,319
will create a nine based pair of

1128
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,200
staggered end and then we like get your

1129
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:41,400
adapters you know to the end of the the

1130
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,200
uh sticky end and then after PCR that

1131
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
single end Gap will be filled in so

1132
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,760
basically you will get like a 9bp

1133
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,359
duplicate if you think about this on the

1134
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,880
two ends of the re uh So eventually when

1135
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,040
you sequence uh your your fragment and

1136
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,040
map it back to the genome the the start

1137
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,040
part of your read is actually the end of

1138
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,400
that nine Bas pair which is not the

1139
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,119
center of that you know symmetry of the

1140
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,960
nine base pair so what we do is that we

1141
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,760
do a shift so you get a nice base pair

1142
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,599
if you're on this end you shift it

1143
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,319
backwards for four base pairs if you're

1144
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,559
on this end you shift it forward for

1145
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:17,599
four based pairs so you're actually

1146
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,000
getting the right center of tn5 and then

1147
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,000
there's a a bunch of different versions

1148
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
on the market some people do plus4 minus

1149
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
5 some do plus plus4 -4 I think the

1150
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,520
correct thing is to do plus4 - for uh we

1151
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,160
actually looked at this pretty

1152
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,079
extensively uh when you don't do full

1153
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,559
printing we don't quantify a single Bas

1154
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,480
resolution if you just calling a taxi

1155
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:40,440
Peaks it doesn't really matter whether

1156
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,440
you do this do the the the shift but

1157
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,079
when you do foot printing is very

1158
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,720
important when you do the shift that why

1159
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,040
you're getting the right thing and then

1160
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,280
in the python package we provided we

1161
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,160
realized that different people might

1162
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,880
have pre-processed the data differently

1163
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,000
some people do plus4 minus four some

1164
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,400
people plusus 5 so we have automatic we

1165
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,079
have a module that a automatically

1166
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,400
detects how what's the shift that you're

1167
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:03,119
doing and it will automatically shift it

1168
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,520
shift the ends to the correct single

1169
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,720
base pair so you don't have to worry

1170
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,760
about it when you run the package that's

1171
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,880
great thank

1172
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,720
you right let's thank our speaker one

1173
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,720
more time that was great
