00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:18,520
welcome to the first video of the third

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:22,320
topic for 21m 383 and this is on streams

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,800
as containers in music

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,359
21 nearly all

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,199
computational music processing systems

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,440
especially those that work with scores

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,640
have a concept cep of a

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,239
container and something that's contained

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
in it size they're called leaves um

10
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,280
sometimes they're in music 21 they're

11
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,800
called elements or boringly music 21

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,680
objects and there usually the concept of

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,399
a container whether called it or not the

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,280
concept of a leaf whether called it or

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,760
not and a third thing we'll talk about

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,440
later called spanners This is the

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,960
representation from a python music

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,559
composition toolkit that works with

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,160
musical scores called objat which uses

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,600
leaes containers spanners and something

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,600
they call indicators which are

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,040
attributes in music 21 will be

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,119
attributes on

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,320
elements so now that we've seen how

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,240
containers and elements or leaves work

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,479
in general let's look at how containers

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,479
work in music 21 where they're called

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,479
streams
