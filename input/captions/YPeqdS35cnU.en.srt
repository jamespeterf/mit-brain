1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,840
Well, it looks like everybody's

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,000
assembled. This is really, really good

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,639
timing. Um, we have a great afternoon

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,480
session today, a whole series of

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,160
terrific talks I'm looking forward to.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,880
And I have the pleasure to um chair our

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,680
this session to on regulatory landscapes

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,560
and gene controls. I'm Brad Bernstein of

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
Broad Epigenomics and Dana Farber. Uh

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,560
our fe first speaker will be Esper

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,560
Madson who's associate professor of

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,000
computational biology at University of

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,480
Southern Denmark and a member of the NNF

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
center our NNF center for genomic

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,920
medicine of disease. Uh his title is

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
learning disentangled representations of

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
single nucleus epiggenomes for variant

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,039
interpretation.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,200
Um and then we'll have uh Jesse Enrace

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,960
will be talking about uh mapping the

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,110
wiring of uh variance to genes and

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:03,960
functions. So, Yesper, you're up.

23
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,960
[Applause]

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,560
See,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,320
okay. Thanks uh for the introduction and

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
uh thanks for the opportunity to talk

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,960
here at the at this uh amazing

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,520
conference or symposium. What I'll be

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,280
talking about today is is methods that

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,439
we're developing for entangled

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,159
representations

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,759
and then I will uh give a vignette of

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,119
how we can use that for variant

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,119
interpretation. So we've heard a few

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,560
talks now talking about QTLs and just

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,079
brought one uh broad slide me I should

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,079
mention that what I'll be talking about

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,560
is not yet published but we hope to to

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,799
have it out within a couple of weeks. So

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
if you feel that uh it's interesting to

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,399
you, please have a have a look uh on

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,640
bioarchchive in the coming weeks. Um so

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,439
how can we interpret G-W was variants?

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
Um we've heard a few times about uh

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,320
QTLs. Uh and there are many different

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,560
types. Uh generally we can say that

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,560
molecular QTLs are are variants

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
associated to molecular outcomes. And

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,640
sort of where the field has started is

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,599
with the EQTLs because if a G-W was lowi

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,319
is also an EQL we have a tractable

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,480
hypothesis for its function. What has

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,160
turned out and was also shown before the

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,160
before launch is that EQTLs and and G-W

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,959
was hits are different. Um the EQTLs are

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,360
mostly in in promoter based uh regions

57
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,920
whereas the G-W was hits are in both

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,959
promoters and enhancers. This has been

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,519
shown uh here but also by others uh

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
where the EQLs here are in orange and

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
they enrich more in promoters. I

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,760
included this slide because it also

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,599
shows other types of QTLs. The chromatin

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,560
accessibility QTLs and histone

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,720
acetilation QTLs and as was also

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,080
mentioned in the talk before the the

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,200
break these seems to be more enriched

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,519
for GW was loa and they also have a

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,760
distribution that is more similar to to

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
GW was being enriched in both enhancers

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,159
and promoters.

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
Another interesting uh recent

73
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,879
development in this field is the

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,760
response element or response uh QTLs.

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,680
I've just shown one uh figure here or

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,239
not one figure but from one recent

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,280
bioarchchive paper where they have about

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,200
50 individuals treated IPSC cells with

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,319
different compounds and then mapped

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,720
response and non-response EQTLs and they

81
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,879
find that the uh response EQTLs

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,440
are more enriched than in the distal

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,159
enhancer like sequences compared to the

84
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,120
non-response EQLs and they are the

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,120
response QTLs are also more enriched in

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,920
GW was uh uh associations.

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,519
So we thought uh that what we would like

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,560
to do is that we would like to then

89
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,840
combine these two approaches. We would

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,439
like to uh see if we can find response

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
CAQLs

92
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,159
uh and try to associate those with

93
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,120
disease and the disease we went for was

94
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,040
type 2 diabetes. It's a disease that we

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,040
study a lot in my group and we went for

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,120
eyelets. So the question um I will try

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,760
to to talk to you about today is whether

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,000
or not we can map type two uh diabetes

99
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,120
response here at QTLs in eyelets using

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
single nucleus attacking data sets. And

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960
when we undertook this problem we almost

102
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,479
immediately stumbled into another

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
problem

104
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,479
here I'm showing you the prevalence of

105
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
different weight categories among

106
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,639
diabetics and uh the general population.

107
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,400
This is from 2020 data from the US. And

108
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,639
what you can see is that the diabetics

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,840
as we all know they are more often um

110
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,919
obese. So this poses a problem which in

111
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,639
statistics is called colinearity.

112
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,120
Essentially when you have a one coariant

113
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,680
you're also likely to have the other QTL

114
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,639
mapping is based on regression. So since

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,280
we have uh colinearity in our regression

116
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,360
model, we actually get unstable uh

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,080
regression coefficients or betas uh

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,800
which is a major problem. This is not

119
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,280
only the case for like population scale

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,479
data, but it's also a a problem in real

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,199
data. So we looked into various signal

122
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
nucleus attack sequencing atlases. So

123
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,240
for example, if we look in the human

124
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,160
lung cell atlas, we see perhaps not

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,720
surprisingly that there's colinearity

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,000
between smoking and cause of death. and

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,639
also smoking and sex. Uh and in the

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,759
human retina cell atlas we also have

129
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,479
multicoline uh between here gender and

130
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,360
age uh which is perhaps less

131
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,039
biologically motiv motivated. So what we

132
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
really wanted to do is we wanted to

133
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,960
design a method that can handle this

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,080
multicolone linearity in single cell

135
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,720
attacking data sets. There are already

136
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,199
regression based methods to do this like

137
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,680
lasso regression. But since we also

138
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,160
wanted to look at response QTLs uh

139
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,560
CAQTLS, we we wanted to do something

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,560
different because we can't treat an

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,479
individual with type two diabetes like

142
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
we treat with ethanol. So we have to do

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,720
something different in order for us to

144
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,960
actually map that response.

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,639
So Andreas a postto in my group

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,720
undertook this challenge and developed a

147
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,639
deep uh learning framework that we call

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,160
deep dive.

149
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,720
Deep dive is a um has two networks that

150
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,440
work in conjunction to reconstruct a

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,280
chromatin accessibility. It has a known

152
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,120
network uh that takes um

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
uh see if I can go back. It has a known

154
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
network that takes a known coariants

155
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,800
that's disease age BMI so on cell type

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,520
and it creates an embedding of those a

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,759
latent space which is decoded and we

158
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
train this latent space in in such a way

159
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,199
that we disentangle the coariants using

160
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,440
adversarial learning and then we have a

161
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,440
another network is the unknown network

162
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,400
which is essentially a standard

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,120
variational out code that learns the uh

164
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,800
remaining latent variation and we train

165
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,960
this network in such a way that we

166
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,880
maximize the information that is learned

167
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
by the known network and then let the

168
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,800
let the unknown network handle the

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,160
residual variation.

170
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,880
This architecture uh unlocks a series of

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,120
downstream applications and today I'll

172
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,039
just be talking about two of them which

173
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,639
is disentanglement and counterfactual

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,440
prediction because we need to

175
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,840
disentangle um the the colinear varial

176
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,000
uh the collinear coariantss and we need

177
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,759
to do counterfactuals in order to do

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,080
type 2 diabetes response CAQLs.

179
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,000
So in order to demonstrate that this

180
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,240
works, I will first try to convince you

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,880
that the architecture overall can

182
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,160
actually reconstruct uh chromatin

183
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,160
accessibility. So we looked at a data

184
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,880
set here from the human liver. This is

185
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,240
just the raw data showing you marker uh

186
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,319
peaks uh and then we trained a a deep

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
dive model and we reconstruct the

188
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,080
epigenomes and see a really nice and

189
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,319
strong correlation between the MAGA

190
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,840
peaks. So we can reconstruct uh cell

191
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,599
type specific uh epigenomes. This is on

192
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,280
the pseudoborg level. We can also show

193
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,000
on the single cell level that our

194
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,240
reconstructions are closer to truth than

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
than by random using the yension

196
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,680
divergence which is more similar as we

197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,440
go to a lower level. So with that in

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,919
hand the next question is then if this

199
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,360
framework can also disentangle colinear

200
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:32,320
coariantss. So to attack that problem we

201
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,320
initially started by simulation. So we

202
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,640
simulate data which has a known

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,279
colinearity. So we can essentially we

204
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,880
created a simulation framework where we

205
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,120
can control the uh entanglement between

206
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,959
coariantss. So we simulate data with two

207
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,080
coariantss given a specific um level of

208
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,560
entanglement. Here is shown an example

209
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
where we have two coariantss and you can

210
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,160
appreciate that there's a higher density

211
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
of points here and here than there is

212
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,880
here and here. So if you look at

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,959
coariant 2, if you are blue here and you

214
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,680
have a small A, then you're also more

215
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,240
likely to have a capital A in coariant

216
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,640
one. So these two coariantss are

217
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,360
entangled with each other.

218
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,160
The good thing about this is that we

219
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,480
know which uh peaks are differentially

220
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
accessible along this axis and also

221
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
which peaks are differentially

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,640
accessible along this axis because we

223
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,399
simulated it. So in order to evaluate if

224
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
colinearity is a problem in single

225
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,000
nucleus attack sequencing data, we took

226
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,160
the uh peaks that we simulated uh to be

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
different along this axis and then we

228
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
ask if they're different along this axis

229
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,440
as well. And the results look like this.

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
So here you I'm showing you the ground

231
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
truth in coariant 2 and the observed

232
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,360
change in coariant one and if there's no

233
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,760
entanglement no problem with

234
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,680
entanglement we'll have a vertical line

235
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,320
but what you can appreciate is that the

236
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,720
signal from coariant 2 bleeds into

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,200
coariant one

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,360
okay so in order to evaluate if our

239
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,200
model can correct for this we trained a

240
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
deep dive model and then we performed

241
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
differential accessibility using that

242
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,160
model and we also did it just using

243
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,320
standard test the vil coxen ranks up

244
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,360
And what we can see is that at 5% error

245
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,920
rate, our model can capture 91% of the

246
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
the differentially accessible uh peaks.

247
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,640
Uh whereas the will cox rank from test

248
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,160
can only capture 34%.

249
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,320
Another way of visualizing this is

250
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,480
through vin diagrams. So this is the

251
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,399
simulated ground truth where we have

252
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
peaks that are specific to coariate one

253
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,360
and two and some that are shared. If we

254
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,200
do a a will cox ransom test, we get a

255
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,640
result that looks like this. Essentially

256
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,279
all of the peaks are um differentially

257
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,800
accessible across both coariantss even

258
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
though they weren't simulated to be.

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
It's simply that the signal is bleeding

260
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,480
through. And if we look at deep dive, we

261
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,160
can see that we can to a very large

262
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,000
extent correct this issue.

263
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,560
Since we're simulating data, we can not

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,519
only we can simulate across all levels

265
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,920
of entanglement, not only one. So if we

266
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,600
do that we can see that this bleeding

267
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,839
effect is dependent on the magnitude of

268
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,560
of entanglement here quantified by

269
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,800
Kramer V. And if we then compare our

270
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,640
model deep dive on the Y-axis compared

271
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,320
to the observed difference we can see

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
that across the spectrum of

273
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,440
entanglements

274
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,200
we can uh have we can improve the the

275
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
recall of differentially accessible

276
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
peaks.

277
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
We can also see that if there's perfect

278
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
entanglement, neither of the models

279
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,560
work. It's just a random guess because

280
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
the two coariantss are identical. So the

281
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,880
model doesn't have a chance to separate

282
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,959
them. And if there's no entanglement,

283
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,399
they are perfectly separated. And there

284
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,560
the standardized test is working well.

285
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,040
This was simulated data. We also wanted

286
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,279
to show this in real data. So we took

287
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,920
this data set from the Sander lab which

288
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,200
uh where they did single nucleus uh

289
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,360
miomics on eyelets from donors with

290
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,800
non-diabetic, pre-diabetic or type two

291
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,959
diabetics and they have also clinical

292
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,160
data available such as disease, BMI,

293
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,800
age, gender and so on. We took that data

294
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,959
set and then just looking at one peak

295
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,320
here you can appreciate this peak here.

296
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,639
There's no difference between the two

297
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,720
sexes. Essentially females and males

298
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,920
have the same accessessibility but there

299
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
is a difference between the

300
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,760
non-diabetics and the type two

301
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,760
diabetics. Then in order to evaluate if

302
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,160
our method works in real data we did a

303
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,560
non-random subsampling that essentially

304
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,680
creates entanglement by by removing

305
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,920
cells from specific groups. And now we

306
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,800
can see that we can purposely entangle

307
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,240
this data set uh to have the effect from

308
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,440
the disease bleed over into the sex uh

309
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,360
variable. Then we run deep dive and we

310
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,560
on this and compare it to the ground

311
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,639
truth and we can see again across all

312
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,959
levels of entanglement that we can

313
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,200
create using this method that deep dive

314
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,519
is outperforming standardized

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,120
statistical testing.

316
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,200
I also told you in the beginning that

317
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,040
there's entanglement between BMI and

318
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,880
type two diabetes. So we also wanted to

319
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,760
try that with this data set since we

320
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,720
have eyelets. So what we did is that we

321
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,320
use deep dive to uh to identify peaks

322
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
that are differentially accessible along

323
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,240
the BMI axis and peaks that are

324
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
differentially accessible along the

325
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,720
disease axis. These although it doesn't

326
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,639
look like it there's quite a lot of

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,399
overplotting here. These two sets are

328
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,200
actually largely orthogonal. There's a

329
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,519
jakard index of about 0.1. So

330
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,079
essentially peaks that are accessible in

331
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,920
one is not really often accessible in

332
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,839
the other set.

333
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,600
So this just means that our method is

334
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,360
finding orthogonal peak sets. It doesn't

335
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,320
actually mean that the peaks that we

336
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,519
call being associated to BMI in eyelets

337
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,600
uh is truly associated to that uh

338
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,440
biological process. So in order to get a

339
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,399
handle on that we use stratified LD

340
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,839
score regression using BMI G-W wases and

341
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,160
also uh type 2 diabetes G-W wases. And

342
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,040
what we can see is the peaks that we

343
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,440
associate to the BMI axis are strongly

344
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,720
enriched also for G-W was associations

345
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,519
with BMI whereas uh the peaks that are

346
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,680
associated to type 2 diabetes in our

347
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,920
model is also enriched for type two

348
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,920
diabetes G-W was associations. As a

349
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,040
control we used handedness which is

350
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,880
depleted in in both uh in both groups of

351
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,040
peaks. So we are quite uh confident that

352
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,760
we are at least partly disentangling

353
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,720
these coariantss and and finding uh

354
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,240
peaks that are specifically associated

355
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,399
with uh coariantss.

356
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720
So since we can do that we can also do

357
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,399
what we call counterfactual prediction

358
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,279
because the way we have structured our

359
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,920
method is that uh the covariants are

360
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,480
additive in latent space. So what that

361
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,240
means is that when we ask deep dive to

362
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,800
produce a reconstruction of a cell type

363
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,519
A in a batch X, what it actually does is

364
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,000
that it takes the vector in the latent

365
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,560
space for batch X and it add cell type A

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,959
and this sum of those two is passed

367
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,000
through the decoder. So that means we

368
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,120
can also decode without batch X. We can

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,360
just not add it omit it. That's one way.

370
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,920
We can also if we for example don't

371
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,000
observe cell type A in batch X but

372
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,079
observe it in other batches we can still

373
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,560
add it to batch X. So we can also do

374
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,440
prediction of unseen coariantss or

375
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,360
unseen combination of coariantss.

376
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,519
So in order to evaluate how well our

377
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,959
method works in these spaces we

378
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,920
initially just did a batch free uh

379
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,079
prediction of epigenomes that is similar

380
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,199
to a batch integration which is

381
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,360
typically done in this field. We used a

382
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,639
standardized pipeline for evaluating

383
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,480
called SEIB from the TIC uh group. And

384
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,320
we compared our method to existing

385
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,279
methods in the field. SEIB produces two

386
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,720
uh primary outcomes. It has a bio

387
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,440
conservation score and a batch

388
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
integration um score. There wasn't

389
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,880
really a difference between bio

390
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,880
conservation between all four methods,

391
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,639
but we could clearly see a difference in

392
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,519
batch integration where our method

393
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,920
performs on par with standard uh with

394
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
with state-of-the-art in this field. We

395
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
are performing a little bit less which

396
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
is likely because our method is

397
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,600
constrained to be additive in the in the

398
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,560
linear space in the laten space whereas

399
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,759
this method is not. The other task we

400
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,160
attempted was to do a prediction of

401
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,320
onseene combinations. So what we did is

402
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,720
that we simulated a data set where there

403
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,639
was three batches and three cell types.

404
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,759
Then we removed the cell type A from

405
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,800
batch X and then we evaluate how well we

406
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,800
can actually recapitulate um that

407
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,959
epiggenome even though it was not seen

408
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,560
during model training.

409
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,639
And the results look like this where we

410
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,120
on the x-axis have the baseline and the

411
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,800
y-axis have the uh counterfactual

412
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,440
prediction of the unseen uh of the

413
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,120
unseen epiggenome of cell type A in

414
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,679
batch X. And you can clearly see that

415
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,160
our model is achieving a high uh

416
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,280
correlations between observed uh between

417
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,520
predicted and ground truth counts. Um so

418
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,520
we do believe that our model is able to

419
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,199
accurately also do counterfactual

420
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,600
prediction.

421
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,360
With that in hand we can now start to

422
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,839
actually address the original question

423
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,120
that I posed which was to try to find

424
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,760
these type 2 diabetes response CAQLs in

425
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,520
eyelets. So for that we returned to this

426
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,160
data set from the Sander group because

427
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,039
they didn't actually only do this uh

428
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,600
they didn't only do single nucleus um

429
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,880
multiomics and and clinical data they

430
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,919
also provide uh genotypes. So we can use

431
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,160
that to to call CAQTLS based on counts

432
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,960
produced or reconstructed with deep

433
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,520
dive. So what we did is that we took the

434
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,520
data, we train a deep dive model and

435
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,919
then we reconstruct

436
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,240
uh for every cell type just one cell

437
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,880
type at a time and we add the donor

438
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,160
specific variation where the residual

439
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,679
signal from the genotype is is located

440
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,840
and then although we just heard that

441
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,240
that pseudobuling is not the best in the

442
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,480
world that's what we did. So we sum

443
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
these counts. The reason that we sum

444
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,799
them is that these counts when we

445
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,280
reconstruct we use a pson target in our

446
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,039
model. So we have an idea that the

447
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,039
reconstructed counts are person

448
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,360
distributed. In reality they are

449
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,840
underdispersed. So we should be using a

450
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,919
generalized person as we just saw. But

451
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,320
we did use a pong meaning that we have a

452
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,000
conservative statistical model. What's

453
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,080
beautiful about the pong model is that

454
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,960
when we add two pong distributions we

455
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,039
get a new pong distribution. So based on

456
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,000
these suitables we can just use pome

457
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,320
regression uh to obtain effect size

458
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,640
estimates only correcting for the number

459
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,440
of cells per donor.

460
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,360
This uh this graph here shows you the

461
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,160
histogram of the effect sizes that we

462
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,640
obtain and we obtain in beta cells

463
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,080
approximately 9 and a half thousand

464
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,280
associations between a peak and a snip.

465
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,000
uh and you can appreciate here that um

466
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,880
the effect sizes have an approximately

467
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,320
uh normal distribution around uh zero

468
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,600
which is obtained without any

469
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,520
normalization or inverse

470
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,559
transformations. It's just modeling

471
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,120
counts as they are predicted by by deep

472
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,520
dive. If we look at an example here, so

473
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,840
we take one of the significant ones and

474
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,000
then we go to the raw data. We normalize

475
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,559
the raw data and we just plot it by

476
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,120
genotype. we can see that there is a

477
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:44,000
clear effect in the raw data as well. So

478
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:47,360
the uh cql snip associations we find in

479
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,880
our in our model is also recapitulated

480
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,799
in the raw data as it is. So now we have

481
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,320
done this we can not only do it in beach

482
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,559
cells but we can do it for every cell

483
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,039
type that's in the data set and we did

484
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:02,080
that and what we see is that essentially

485
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,160
we find only cell type specific CAQLs in

486
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,760
our data. That's not really surprising

487
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,240
because we train our model with an

488
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,039
adversarial loss. So we train it to

489
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,039
separate the variations. Again, if we

490
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,600
look at an example here, we can have one

491
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,400
example of a peak snip association which

492
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,360
has a very b cell specific effect. If we

493
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,760
go to the raw data again, we can also

494
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,760
see that this also holds true in the raw

495
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,080
data that we find a cell type specific

496
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,000
associate peak snip association which is

497
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,600
not present in any of the other cell

498
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,440
types.

499
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,159
We of course also not the only ones to

500
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
have ever mapped CAQL and eyelets. So in

501
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,799
order to give us further confidence that

502
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,960
the CAQTLS we're finding based on the

503
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,440
reconstructed counts is uh is uh true we

504
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,600
we went to another data set. This is a

505
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,480
quite old one from this digital group

506
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,200
where they did CAQLs in bulk eyelets

507
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,559
from 20 donors and then we just made a

508
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,320
naive analysis comparing our CAQLs to

509
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,600
their CAQLs

510
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,240
and what we find is that our CAQLs are

511
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,240
enriched above baseline. That's baseline

512
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
model here is prediction without any

513
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,159
cell type

514
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,760
and that happens specifically in the

515
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,760
endocrine cell types consistent with uh

516
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,440
the data set that we're comparing to

517
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,520
being whole eyelid CA caqls.

518
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,000
So that gives us again confidence that

519
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,960
we can use this framework reconstructing

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,159
counts and using pong regression on

521
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,760
those counts to to identify cqtls.

522
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,919
What's then interesting is of course to

523
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,280
try to compare it to uh G-W was

524
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,600
associations. So we took a recent uh

525
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,320
type two diabetes G-W was and we compare

526
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,159
our CAQTLS again a somewhat naive

527
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,400
analysis I should say this is really

528
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,600
fresh analysis just rolling off of of

529
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,919
the notebooks. So um so it's not

530
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,039
collocicalized it's just naive overlap.

531
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,720
Um but what we can see is that now

532
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,960
there's no really enrichment in the

533
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
baseline. So if we don't have any cell

534
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,799
uh cell type information in there, we

535
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,120
don't see any association to type 2

536
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,679
diabetes. But when we then add each cell

537
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,520
type, we canite quite clearly see and

538
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,760
effect. We see that especially beta

539
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,039
cells, but also alpha delta cells are

540
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,640
highly enriched uh the cqls we find in

541
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,440
those cell types are highly enriched for

542
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,120
also being type two diabetic type two

543
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,960
diabetes

544
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,640
associations.

545
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
So with that in hand, now we're quite

546
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,039
confident that we can cause QTLs. Now we

547
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,200
can get to the question from the very

548
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,360
beginning which was to find type 2

549
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,960
diabetes response uh CAQLs. So we went

550
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,280
further with the beta cells since they

551
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,760
were the most enriched for this G-W was

552
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,480
associations. And what we do now is that

553
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,640
we take our model then we reconstruct

554
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,799
for beta cells and Dota donor specific

555
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,440
variation and we do as we did before we

556
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,440
get pseudobox. What we then did next is

557
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,600
that for every donor in our data set we

558
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,760
virtually shift their disease label. So

559
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
we turn the di type two diabetics into

560
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,679
non-diabetics and we turn the

561
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,320
non-diabetics into type two diabetics to

562
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,280
give us a counterfactual epigenome. So

563
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,080
now we have two epiggenomes and we have

564
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,760
the epiggenome for from the same donor.

565
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,840
We have that in the predicted

566
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,679
non-diabetic state and in the type two

567
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,760
diabetic state. So it's not we're not

568
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,840
comparing different groups of donors but

569
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,880
we're comparing the same donor to

570
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,600
itself. And there what we can do is then

571
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,280
we subtract these two pong distributions

572
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,960
from each other that gives us a new

573
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,720
distribution which is called the skeleum

574
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,280
distribution and then we can use asmtoic

575
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,360
approximations of bessel functions to do

576
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,200
skeleum regression and identify caqls.

577
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,880
So if we look at an example of one of

578
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
the hits from this model it looks like

579
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,039
this. So we on the y- axis here we have

580
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,760
the delta count now and you can see

581
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,840
there's association between the genotype

582
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,320
and the delta count. The model is

583
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,320
predicting here that individuals with

584
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,840
this genotype the type 2 diabetics

585
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,720
should have a higher count than the

586
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,760
non-diabetics and vice versa in this

587
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,039
genotype the non-diabetics should have a

588
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,360
higher count than the type two

589
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,760
diabetics. If we don't go back to the

590
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,880
original the raw data we can see that

591
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,640
that is actually also the true uh at

592
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,200
least that's what we observe in the raw

593
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:25,600
data. So we can identify these uh CAQTLs

594
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,159
where there is a differential response

595
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,400
uh in the in the two disease stages uh

596
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,840
to the genotype.

597
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,679
One thing that's interesting about this

598
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,600
is that if we keep looking at this

599
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,400
example and we just ask is it also a

600
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,559
CAQL for the cell type? It's not. And

601
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,159
that's actually a general tendency that

602
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,720
these two ways of identifying CAQLs are

603
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,600
identifying different signals. So on the

604
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,240
x-axis here we have the all of the CAQTL

605
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,480
effect sizes for beta cells and here we

606
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,360
have all of the effect sizes for type 2

607
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,080
diabetes response in beta cells and

608
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,840
there's essentially very little overlap.

609
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,559
So then the really really interesting

610
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,400
question is of course if these or these

611
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,559
are more associated to type two diabetes

612
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
G-W was associations.

613
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,480
So what we did is that we did the same

614
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,640
analysis. We take the type two diabetes

615
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,279
G-W was and we perform enrichment

616
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,880
analysis and what we find is that across

617
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,799
all thresholds of G-W was uh uh beta

618
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,799
effect sizes somewhere around here is

619
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,120
genomewide significant and this is very

620
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,600
significant. we see that this uh type

621
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,480
two diabetes response CAQLs are much

622
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:37,120
more enriched among G was uh associated

623
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:40,480
hits. So with that I will conclude uh

624
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,480
that I hope I have shown that um our

625
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,760
model deep dive can actually uh

626
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,159
disentangle colinear colinear coariantss

627
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,640
and that once we can do that we can also

628
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,039
do counterfactual prediction. we can use

629
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,080
counterfactual prediction to identify

630
00:25:53,039 --> 00:26:01,520
CAQTLS by omitting variables or eron

631
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,000
type analysis and that uh these type 2

632
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,960
diabetes response CQTLs we find in beta

633
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
cells are highly enriched among type 2

634
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,840
diabetes G-W was associations. So I

635
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,400
would like to of course thank my team

636
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,520
especially Andreas uh who's spearheading

637
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,200
the development of of C of deep dive. I

638
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,919
also like to thank our collaborators,

639
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,760
our senses and funders and you for

640
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,760
listening and I'm happy to take any

641
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,330
questions.

642
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:32,000
[Applause]

643
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,559
[Music]

644
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,240
That was a terrific talk. Is there

645
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,360
opportunity now to integrate this T2D

646
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,919
response CAQTLS with language model

647
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,279
sequence models? Is there is there

648
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,240
enough power? Are there enough of them?

649
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,760
Is there power that you can then

650
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,360
identify the motifs and upstream

651
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,640
pathways that are specific to the

652
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,320
process?

653
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,200
>> That's a really excellent question. We

654
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,440
haven't dug into it at all yet. So, we

655
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,919
just got these uh results. So, it's

656
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,159
really, as I said, something that was uh

657
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,480
I I made these slides on Monday, so it's

658
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,400
really new. Uh so, we we don't know yet.

659
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,039
>> All right, more questions.

660
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,600
>> Yes. Um thanks yes for for a super nice

661
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,960
talk and super nice work by Andreas. I

662
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,000
have a question regarding the the

663
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,159
correction right like the risk here is

664
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,159
overcorrecting because we are forcing to

665
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,440
find like the the the contributions of

666
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,600
the different coariantss but we are

667
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,360
missing on the shared trends and my

668
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,559
question is like what's the sweet spot

669
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,480
and how do you like basically yeah not

670
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,159
enforce it like not not pass from the

671
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
other end kind of of the correction.

672
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,520
Yeah.

673
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:44,720
>> Yeah. Um so what we see is that uh our

674
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,120
model is it disentangles but we don't

675
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,400
see that it it captures everything. So

676
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,120
there is a loss of sensitivity due to

677
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,480
disentanglement. Um we could also see

678
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,960
that there was a little bit hard to see

679
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,360
on the vin diagrams but actually the the

680
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,520
number of uh differentially associated

681
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,000
peaks that we find although disentangle

682
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,399
is not the full complement. So we do

683
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
lose power by this approach. But I do

684
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,039
think we also gain a lot of power

685
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,880
because for example in this uh response

686
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,200
analysis we're comparing the same

687
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,520
individual to itself rather than having

688
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,760
different groups. So we're asking if all

689
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,679
else all other things being the same

690
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,279
what is then the effect of this coariant

691
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,600
in isolation. Um so there's definitely a

692
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,840
trade-off. we lose some power and we

693
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,279
can't detect all of it but we also gain

694
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,679
power by having paired or strongly

695
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,080
associated measures or predictions.

696
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,159
>> Thank you.

697
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,000
>> Thanks VJ. Uh ve very very nice. Um

698
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,559
given that you see this enrichment with

699
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
dynamic sort of accessibility peaks.

700
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,080
Have you thought about then subsetting

701
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,159
those based upon dynamics for specific

702
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,520
transcription factor motifs? Like if you

703
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,440
were to look at specific transcription

704
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,960
would you get more power? Could you get

705
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,279
more enrichment? Erh, I mean as as I

706
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,520
said this is really fresh resource. So

707
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,840
we're really open also to collaboration.

708
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,760
If you or others have good ideas of how

709
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,919
we can take this further, we're really

710
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,440
open to to engage in that discussion. I

711
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,960
think looking at the transcription

712
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,960
factors is is a is a really interesting

713
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
uh approach and and we should definitely

714
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
do that. There might also be like motive

715
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,640
breakage uh going on that we could

716
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,039
identify and so on, but it be

717
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,039
interesting to to dig into that. Yeah.

718
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:36,140
Great, fantastic talk. Thanks.

719
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:36,140
[Applause]
