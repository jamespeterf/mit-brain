(motorbike engine roaring)

00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:16,399

(lively music)
(ball squeaking)

10
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,668
- [Narrator] Wow.

11
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:05,508
(lively music continues)

12
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:14,677
(avatar whistling)
(chair crashing)

13
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,030
- Hello, I'm David Wallace,

14
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,150
a mechanical engineering
design professor at MIT.

15
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,970
And this is my friend Finnegan.

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,710
And like a typical pet owner,

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,030
I like to teach him things.

18
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,731
He can throw and catch.

19
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:32,704
(upbeat music)
(ball squeaking)

20
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:33,900
(indistinct)

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,160
There you go!
(David chuckling)

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,530
But does Finnegan teach me?

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,180
Of course he does.

24
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,140
He reminds me to feel
playful, positive inside,

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,520
even when doing serious
work, to play seriously.

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,261
He reminds me that everyone
has something to teach.

27
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,490
(lively music continues)
(all laughing)

28
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,410
- Can you then drive for a second?

29
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,650
- [David] We just need to
have the humility, curiosity,

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,220
and respect so that we can actually hear.

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,099
We need to have the willingness to learn.

32
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,000
- You seem to think that I
was doing something wrong,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,482
but I don't think I was
doing anything wrong.

34
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:13,482
(students laughing)
(students murmuring)

35
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:17,303
(dog nails clicking)
(David chuckling)

36
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,900
(tranquil music)
(David talking indistinctly)

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,950
(David laughing)

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,250
- In our mechanical engineering
product design class at MIT,

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,900
one of the core values

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,293
that we teach is called
user-centric design.

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,910
It's the idea of placing
the needs of the user

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,790
and the user's experience at the center

43
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,173
of our design thinking.

44
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,790
And if we can really
learn how to empathize

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,960
with those users,

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,270
we're going to be in
a much better position

47
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,859
to do something great,
and that's great for them.

48
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,670
(machine whirring)

49
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,680
That's our job actually,

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,942
no matter who we are designing for.

51
00:02:58,942 --> 00:02:59,991
(board clacking)

52
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:03,630
What was that, hey?
(David chuckling)

53
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,921
Ready?

54
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:07,504
(upbeat music)

55
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,980
So we're always trying
to learn as we design.

56
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,810
And as we go about our work,

57
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,880
there are some fairly obvious places

58
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,070
that we look for information.

59
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,300
We can consult with experts,
we seek input from our peers.

60
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,480
We hear advice from those
with more experience.

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,390
And of course we go out into the wild

62
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,400
and spend time with the users,

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,173
asking them for their input.

64
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,110
- [Student] First what's gonna happen

65
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,630
is we're gonna raise the rails of the bed.

66
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,000
- Do we miss opportunities to learn,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,890
perhaps something surprising

68
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,890
or really important that came
from less obvious teachers?

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,787
Almost certainly.

70
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:54,287
(students cheering)

71
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,381
(student laughing)

72
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,881
(upbeat electronic music)

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,000
Have you ever judged a
person and dismissed them

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,463
simply because they
are different from you?

75
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,390
Have you felt superior because
you are richer or poorer

76
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,180
or more educated or less educated?

77
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,410
Or maybe because you are
white collar or blue collar,

78
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,200
or you're from one culture, not another.

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,740
It's really quite easy to do, isn't it?

80
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,880
But in discounting, we miss
all kinds of opportunities

81
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,580
to learn things that some day

82
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,242
might really help us in something
that we are trying to do.

83
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,940
(upbeat music)

84
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,490
Everyone has something to teach,

85
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,360
and openness to being taught
allows us to learn in ways

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,790
that we might never expect,

87
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,740
things that some day might turn out

88
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,663
to be really useful in our own pursuits.

89
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,900
- Oh, okay, I see.
(student laughing)

90
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,960
- So keep working to
build your understanding,

91
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,960
your repository of knowledge and insights.

92
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,030
Be humble, curious,

93
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,630
watch, listen and absorb.

94
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,830
When you receive information,
entertain it, consider it,

95
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,560
let it sink in and judge it.

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,950
It might be really useful,
it might be a revelation

97
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,920
or perhaps, "Nope, that
doesn't work for me."

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,860
Either way, you've gained new insight.

99
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,390
The more that you learn,

100
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,580
the more that you have to work with,

101
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,310
insights to help you realize your goals

102
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,233
to play seriously.

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,776
Bye, bye.
(upbeat music continues)

104
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:37,858
(paws pounding)
