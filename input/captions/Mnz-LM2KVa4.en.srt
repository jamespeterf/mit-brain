1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,400
today we're going to do two really

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,600
important things that we uh I really

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,080
want to get through uh today and the

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,000
first one involves um the final um

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,920
project for the class so what I'm going

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,640
to ask you to do um is to take a minute

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,920
and after I tell you what you're going

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,079
to be doing um find a a partner um if

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,879
we're not an even number um you can do a

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,160
part uh one group of three but I'd

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,920
prefer uh groups of two have tended to

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,160
work a lot better um that you're going

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,000
to be willing to work on a project

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,960
starting um next week and start thinking

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,719
about what you would like to do it can

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,960
be anything related to music theory and

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,079
Analysis in the symbolic domain that is

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,439
to say working with notes and scores not

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,479
primarily working with audio or um

20
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,320
things like that when you want to do

21
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,119
that uh take uh Aran Go's amazing

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,520
classes where you can do great projects

23
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,240
on audio um and it can be um it can be a

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,040
research type problem you can try to

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,759
solve a research um problem you can it

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,759
can be more of a business development

27
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,600
and Entrepreneurship type problem trying

28
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,280
to um trying to build a product that

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,720
does something interesting with music

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,240
theory or it can be a creative project

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,000
uh I've mentioned at the beginning of

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,200
the semester but I I'll want to say it

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,200
again uh the only restriction uh besides

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,799
primarily symbolically based is that if

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,200
you are doing a creative project I don't

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,119
want to it to be based on deep learning

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,159
Ai and the reason for that is as a

38
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,360
safety for y'all um I've allowed it in

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,399
the past and it hasn't worked very well

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,960
um and we'll get to we will do a lecture

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,280
on uh AI later on or to a topic on AI

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,880
and then I'll be able to explain a

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,759
little bit more on U what the constraint

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,959
that tends to make those projects not

45
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,920
work very

46
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
well so has anybody already been

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,120
thinking over the course of the semester

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,599
of something that you're interested I'm

49
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,720
not going to ask you to say it but I'm

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,080
just just curious who's who's been

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,920
thinking a little bit a little bit a

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,040
little bit okay so some some over here

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,160
um so let's take 10 minutes 5 minutes um

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,599
5 minutes to find somebody that you'd

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,760
like to work with so let's all stand

56
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,159
up okay we'll get to

57
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,840
um we let's let's uh no actually your

58
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,200
your computers are mostly closed so let

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,159
me um just remind us a little bit of the

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,040
perative topic for the week and um talk

61
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,920
about some of the things yes yes it's

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,800
down thank you just shout when you get

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,480
that H I did remember to turn the signal

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,360
back on but yep thank you

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,640
so we're going to talk about um some of

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,840
the other um things that we that we were

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,400
talking about last class with

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,400
algorithmic composition so first off who

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,519
now has been able to access the iliac

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,200
suite and recording okay great super so

71
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,640
so we're in a better uh position there

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,879
um we talked about um whether or not the

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,840
iliac Suite was um was sort of more

74
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:31,519
written to create music that sounded

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,879
like a human or whether was created to

76
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,480
do something very new and what did we

77
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,439
come to this is consensus anyone want to

78
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,080
throw that

79
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,560
out or what you towards doing something

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,280
new what's that 7030 toward doing

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,080
something new yeah yeah something like

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
that some some percentage some mixture

83
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,519
of some parts of what they were trying

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,480
to do really was about hey this is

85
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,439
something humans do let's see if a

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,040
computer do can do it and then there was

87
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,840
the moments um like the one with the

88
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,760
algorithmic putting of claps and and uh

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
hitting the violins and stuff like that

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,760
at different points which um was a

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,280
little bit more computery right we also

92
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,760
talked about Markov

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,280
chains um in the last class and we'll

94
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,840
get a little bit later on into some of

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,400
the more sophisticated statistical

96
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,759
learning that people are doing today

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,199
with um with AI learning but a lot of it

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,600
is very very similar it's just um a lot

99
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,960
faster or a lot big bigger than things

100
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,400
but but I want to talk about some things

101
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,360
um and we'll get to uh get to that later

102
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,240
pretend I didn't show that

103
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,479
so there's two ways that we can

104
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,240
distinguish um algorithmic composition

105
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,560
one of them is whether it's

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,240
deterministic or if it has a random

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,800
chance in it um whether or not every

108
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,479
time you play the piece or or run the

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,720
piece it will be a different piece or

110
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,160
it'll be the same um so I want to start

111
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,960
by giving I'm going to uh go pretty

112
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
egotistically with two pieces that I've

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
written the first one's not even really

114
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,479
a piece but it's kind of a little

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,880
demonstration it starts with um a demo

116
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,880
that you might have seen in a science uh

117
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,880
class or physics class where all the

118
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:22,840
balls um are moving at different lengths

119
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:26,759
but um they do kind of some interesting

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,759
optical illusion effects at various

121
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,759
times ASMR

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
oh my

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,199
God is there supposed to be a music in

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,199
the backr No No Music yet

125
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,240
okay so I thought what what if there was

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,840
a musical equivalent of this what if we

127
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,960
could write a computer program that had

128
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,400
um 12 lines or eight lines or something

129
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,919
like that that all started in phase and

130
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,360
then slowly got out of phase and came

131
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,880
back together like the pendulum and so

132
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,640
um this is a little bit what um what I

133
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:48,059
came up with

134
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:48,059
[Music]

135
00:06:50,760 --> 00:07:03,120
[Music]

136
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,680
okay I can't follow my own score um

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,560
properly

138
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,080
so what's that like the double dotted

139
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,680
16th rest yeah yeah so sometimes uh when

140
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
you when you're making an algorithmic

141
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,879
composition maybe you want to um you

142
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,720
know think a little bit about the

143
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,599
notation or maybe it would better just

144
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,319
to hear it without seeing the notation

145
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,800
at all so one of the questions is what

146
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,440
is um if the computer is just setting it

147
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,160
up so that each note comes in at a

148
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,919
slightly different time from the

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,919
previous what what kinds of things does

150
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,919
the composer have for her or his or

151
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,919
their um

152
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,919
creativity yeah go Jason which notes

153
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,000
which pitches show up so pitching which

154
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,199
pitches show up good good up um that

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,159
could in fact let me um let me do it

156
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,000
here is with instead of using I think I

157
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:59,800
used eight notes out of the octave here

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,800
is all uh 12 notes

159
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:10,240
[Music]

160
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,879
and that sounds a little bit more

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,479
familiar a little maybe a little bit

162
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,479
closer um why might I not have wanted to

163
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,479
use this as my main

164
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,680
[Music]

165
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,159
piece it has something to do with the

166
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
duration of the piece for me that that

167
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:32,000
that it ended up being a little bit too

168
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
long so yeah definitely what notes we

169
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,200
use okay um we can even go to weird

170
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,479
things that a human can't usually play

171
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,479
on a

172
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,480
piano so this is 19 tone division of the

173
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,680
octave let's you use a few more notes

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,680
per

175
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,200
octave oh oh blanking it stops stops the

176
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,320
music um good yeah yeah I think it's a

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,880
19 I don't think it would be 24 or

178
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,680
something yeah um sure it's a little

179
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,760
degression but it's it's kind of cool if

180
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:13,360
anybody's interested in it a 19 tone uh

181
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,480
division of the octave has uh has two

182
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,800
pretty cool properties one is that it um

183
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,240
it has major and minor Triads that are

184
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,519
very very close to acoustically or major

185
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,279
and minor thirds very close to

186
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,760
acoustically um correct while also

187
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,720
having perfect force and uh perfect fths

188
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,279
are pretty good so that's one reason the

189
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,680
other reason for it is a lot of 19 tone

190
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,760
piano uh a lot of 19 tone music is

191
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,079
written for Two Piano Duets where you

192
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,480
keep um the five yeah that's that yeah

193
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,880
the five Black Keys the same between

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,200
each of the pianos and then you um

195
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,519
retune the the white keys so that you

196
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:59,120
have a separate note for um for for each

197
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,120
of the is that right five seven 77 14

198
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,079
and five yeah yeah can't remember it's

199
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,959
been a long time since I wrote for 19

200
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,320
tone piano they don't like retuning our

201
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,959
pianos for that very much um but yeah so

202
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,279
it makes it a little bit more human

203
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,279
there other other choices you could

204
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,920
do

205
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,760
instruments you could do it how long it

206
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,000
goes how whether it's going to be slower

207
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,360
faster so these are some things we can

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,720
do um okay so let's

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,639
um then we'll get into

210
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,600
non-deterministic um things and so let's

211
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,680
let's code one up first so go a and grab

212
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,120
up before I get to um particular pieces

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,120
that are like that

214
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,279
um so let's try some of the things that

215
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:55,720
we might do and see how aesthetically

216
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:59,399
interesting it is oops uh where' that go

217
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,399
is that over here

218
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,720
okay got look move this over as much as

219
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,040
I can okay

220
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,800
good great

221
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,639
so what's the module you hope I've

222
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,519
unlocked it's not part of Music 21 it's

223
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,120
part of python in order to do

224
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,279
non-deterministic

225
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,240
composition random great so let's import

226
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,600
random and for now let's just import

227
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,399
everything from music 21 is that yep

228
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,079
that's good you can see that

229
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,440
good um who has

230
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,160
who has worked with the random module

231
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,160
before

232
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,560
not okay there's basically everybody you

233
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,160
know that random.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,880
random gives

235
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,240
you between Z between Zer and one yep Oh

236
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,240
shoot no that's not the same as as I

237
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,200
might have mistyped I I I have it here

238
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
and it says it should be02

239
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,880
three okay okay good good good we all

240
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,360
know that random so um in a lot of

241
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,240
language is of course you'll do uh in

242
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,720
order to get between 0 and 100 say you

243
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,639
would just multiply by 100 we did pretty

244
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,079
well on that played the lottery today um

245
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,920
you just multiply by 100 python also has

246
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:19,680
this Rand

247
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:24,920
int from 1 to 100 and um this is one of

248
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:28,079
the older modules in Python so it

249
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,040
um it has a little bit of of uh

250
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,040
inconsistency with the rest of python in

251
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,760
that

252
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,880
um well this if I do this three times on

253
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,720
average I should be able to see the

254
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,800
inconsistency that it's an um it

255
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,959
includes the final number right so if

256
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,519
you do range one to 100 in Python your

257
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,760
last one will be 99 in most languages

258
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,240
but this one will include

259
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:59,279
that um really useful this is um this

260
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,000
might be all review for somebody is that

261
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,920
you can um you know do random choice so

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,199
if you have a list of things or any

263
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,920
other um algorithm you can randomly

264
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:16,480
choose one from that and

265
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:20,680
um you can do a Wade choice in this

266
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,760
simply by putting in

267
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,600
something oops uh I hit the wrong key

268
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,600
putting in something a lot of

269
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,120
times now there there's probably if

270
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,279
you're going to do this 10,000 by 10,000

271
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,440
there's other more efficient algorithms

272
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:41,440
you can do for this right

273
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,839
okay questions on Randomness outside of

274
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,240
music by the way there is also there's a

275
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,199
way that you can set it up so that it's

276
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,959
random at first but then you can

277
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:53,480
reconstruct your Randomness by doing uh

278
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,040
it's called a deterministic seed which I

279
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,279
often do when I'm um writing

280
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,639
compositions so that if there's

281
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,519
something I really really like I can

282
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,480
reconstruct up until the point I didn't

283
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,240
like it um

284
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,440
okay we're going to so let's write first

285
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,000
off what we call a random walk

286
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,040
composition so we're just going to start

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,600
by doing something pretty stupid and try

288
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,839
to make it better so we're going to

289
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:22,160
randomly walk around the scale um we'll

290
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,560
start let's create um something that's

291
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,720
going to be a useful heler

292
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,279
function which is uh I'll call it

293
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,399
multi-show you you can skip the

294
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,000
annotations while you're doing this so

295
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,160
what this does is just going to take in

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,199
a stream and show

297
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:43,720
it as um as both an image and midi so if

298
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:46,639
we you know Bo we'll just do our

299
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,399
favorite Bo piece just a demo BWB

300
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,480
66.6

301
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,800
multi-show Bo this I find helpful for um

302
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,000
for anytime I'm working with something

303
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,920
always takes for a lot longer when I'm

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,399
projecting and the first time but you

305
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,440
get the

306
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,360
score and then below oops that never

307
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,360
looks right on the video

308
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:19,600
oops yep that's a piece we know okay so

309
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:24,560
that's just a useful helpful function so

310
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,480
um one of the uh one of the parts of of

311
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,959
the pitch that of pitches that I find

312
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,000
really helpful for not being completely

313
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,920
random here is this um thing that would

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,319
have been really helpful on that problem

315
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,600
set where you um had to determine the

316
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,480
number of lines the generic intervals

317
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,079
between uh notes if you remember that

318
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,600
that's something called dionic note

319
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,600
number dionic note number and this is a

320
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,959
concept that I couldn't um that I was

321
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,160
really really surprised I was like

322
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,000
somebody must have named this and it

323
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,920
didn't didn't seem to have a name before

324
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,920
it's simply just like

325
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,199
has I don't think I went over this in

326
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:10,959
class right now think so that C4 middle

327
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:16,160
C is arbitrarily assigned to MIDI number

328
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:21,040
60 um arbitrarily assigned middle C to

329
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,040
dionic note number that's midi 60 29

330
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,480
it's not neither of these are completely

331
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,560
arbitrary there's a reason for them and

332
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:34,240
the notion is that all C's CS except Etc

333
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,480
have dionic note num 29 so C

334
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:42,000
sharp and that just tells you um see

335
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:45,519
double sharp yep okay so on see

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,959
flat great and so this is helpful for

337
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,600
writing dionic music that you can just

338
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:53,160
manipulate the dionic note number of a

339
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,560
note and you don't have to worry um

340
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,440
making it um sound a little bit better

341
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,959
or something we should have a pentatonic

342
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,160
note number also because that that's

343
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,559
makes it even better to do something

344
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,679
okay so what I'm going to do is um and

345
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:14,720
then we can just do n.

346
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,720
pitch. diatonic not Nom plus equals

347
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,520
4 and move things around that

348
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,439
way if you haven't seen it yet one of

349
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:29,559
the um things in music 21 that's not uh

350
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,080
so good is that you'll often need to

351
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,919
copy things so we'll get to that in just

352
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,880
a little bit but I'm going to import

353
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,559
copy and if you've never used this um

354
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,760
copy

355
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,760
and oops copy is a module copy.

356
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,160
copy so I did turn n into a g and so now

357
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:54,080
it's a g there's two things um who who

358
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,240
has never who has used the copy module

359
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,280
in in Python before no not too many okay

360
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,600
good so so because cuz for the most part

361
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,919
you might just want to do you know just

362
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,440
create another note if you wanted to do

363
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,880
that don't need to type that um but you

364
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,400
can also copy an existing one and what

365
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,760
you'll use much more is a something

366
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,320
called Deep

367
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,559
copy and the difference you can see that

368
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,039
copying the note gives you a a note

369
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:26,600
that's G deep copying gives a note

370
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:29,400
that's G the difference is that um well

371
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,039
here easier to easier to just show than

372
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,440
tell right um n c is no is going to be

373
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:39,360
the copy of

374
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:43,120
N and we'll say DC is the

375
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,880
Deep my computer just froze there we go

376
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,880
uh DC is the Deep copy of

377
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,080
n the difference is so if here we'll

378
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,400
just make sure that they're all here

379
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,360
they're all yep three

380
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,200
notes difference is if we take n it's

381
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,120
pitch

382
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,880
dionic note

383
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,880
num and go up four

384
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,600
more

385
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:21,000
that the copy of n also

386
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:24,520
changes whereas the um the Deep copy

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,080
doesn't change and so what uh some

388
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,720
people might think of this as um you you

389
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,880
you end up working with this with a

390
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
arrays in a lot of other languages and

391
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,880
stuff that copying an array you still

392
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,360
have references to the internal pointer

393
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,039
so anything that is itself an object

394
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,280
like n.

395
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,919
pitch and nc.

396
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,080
Pitch will still be the same under a

397
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,080
shallow or normal

398
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,120
copy but with a deep copy they're

399
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,120
different

400
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,760
deep copies

401
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,799
pitch so you'll find when you're when

402
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,840
you're manipulating things and you you

403
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,080
get to a particular point in the score

404
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,520
and now you want to add something else

405
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,400
that's a manipulation of what came

406
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,039
before you'll want to make a deep copy

407
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,679
of it beforehand does that make sense

408
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,400
cool are we questions yeah what did you

409
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,960
show with the last part so like the

410
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,840
pitch is going to be different by

411
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,120
definition um oh sure sure I think it's

412
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,720
a little bit hard because this is part

413
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,000
here so when you make a shallow copy and

414
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,240
you change some and you change some

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,919
nested structure within there like a

416
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,919
pitch or a duration it will not be

417
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:48,080
um they're they're all shared so so what

418
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,440
you do is sort of think of it as um I

419
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,720
don't know what's what's something else

420
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,880
is not sh so N is a note and N has I

421
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,760
wish I had set this before ID equals

422
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:05,039
note and

423
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,039
pitch equals some sort of a pitch. pitch

424
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:14,360
object and Dot uh duration I say dur is

425
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,360
some kind of duration

426
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:25,919
object when you do a shallow copy

427
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:29,200
NC will be NC's ID equals n's ID and

428
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,559
NC's pitch

429
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,559
equals NC uh n's

430
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,880
pitch and so since ID is just a string

431
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,640
or something like that once it's copied

432
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,159
over they have no connection to each

433
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,320
other but since we've copied the pitch

434
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,840
over and it's uh it's a complex object

435
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,520
when you change something on this when

436
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,919
this manipulates this

437
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,000
manipulates so with a but with a deep

438
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:05,679
copy we you do is dc.

439
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,960
pitch oh hold that first let's do a deep

440
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,320
copy of the pitch and so you keep going

441
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,559
down and you make sure that nothing is

442
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,760
connected between the

443
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,320
two that this also slightly misleading

444
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,039
right because you like there's nothing

445
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,120
that actually says nc. pitch is equal to

446
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,520
n. pitch in fact like that's the whole

447
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,799
point like if it did that that would be

448
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,919
an example of deep copy right no because

449
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:32,039
you're you're referencing the same

450
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,159
object in pointer So when you say n.

451
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:38,760
pitch it's actually thinking in the

452
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,559
computer oh that is the complex object

453
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,039
being stored at some random memory

454
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,320
location somewhere okay so pointing to

455
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,720
the label so it's still pointing to the

456
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,200
same label yeah so exactly for for

457
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,320
people who know that kind of terminology

458
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,240
um it's pointing to the same label

459
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,360
whereas this one goes to the label and

460
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,320
copies everything and makes a new new

461
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,400
pointer uhh

462
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,600
so th that ends up being pretty

463
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,480
important and if anybody wants to make

464
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,799
their um final project making music 21

465
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,320
faster you could find places that we

466
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,559
deep copy more than we have to because

467
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,679
that's s of the slowest thing in that um

468
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,320
in what what's happening okay too much

469
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,240
of an aside back to some music great so

470
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,880
we'll get back to our random walk

471
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,039
composition once I find where this went

472
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
yeah here we

473
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:35,320
go great so we're going to be copying

474
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,840
things uh pretty soon but first let's

475
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,960
just create we'll create a generic

476
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,360
stream which we rarely do nowadays besid

477
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,120
maybe we want to make it a part or

478
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,520
something but generic stream will work

479
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,720
pretty well and let's just say for I in

480
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,400
range

481
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:56,559
30 let's just append 30 random

482
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,320
notes or no let's let's do let's do this

483
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,159
no let's start on C

484
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,200
current well just we'll just call it

485
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,640
Curr that's current datomic note number

486
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,520
um when we're coding fast we don't need

487
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,159
my obsession with long variables right

488
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:16,960
so we'll say note equals note.

489
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:18,320
note and Pitch dionic note num equals

490
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,559
the current

491
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,480
one and that works pretty well um stream

492
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:28,480
append sorry thank you that's why I

493
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,399
shouldn't do that thank you please all

494
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,760
always just do that I appreciate that

495
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,760
big help um and we'll just say we're

496
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,360
going to choose between going down a

497
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,000
step going up a step and so on so our

498
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:45,559
first note will always

499
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,559
be c c C4 and now let's multi-show

500
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,080
that pretty boring piece

501
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,090
but here we go oh this one went down

502
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,200
this

503
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,200
[Music]

504
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:04,399
time Etc anybody's more interesting

505
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:08,960
anyone's go up and want just hit

506
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:10,440
play yeah okay so not a great piece uh

507
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,760
the easiest thing I could do to make it

508
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,720
a little bit better by the way would be

509
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,320
make my number of notes I attached be um

510
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,919
a what do you call it a multiple of four

511
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,640
right but okay so let's let's move on to

512
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,200
do some things that are a little bit

513
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,840
more interesting um maybe we could do

514
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,559
something like this let's um I'm going

515
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,760
to copy and paste a lot on this so we

516
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:37,360
can go ahead and just tweak what we're

517
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,799
doing you in fact probably don't even

518
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,840
need to copy and paste you can just keep

519
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,720
tweaking the same cell forever so what's

520
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,159
something we should do to make this a

521
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,159
little bit more

522
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:56,600
interesting Rhythm great so let's um

523
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,240
have each note and. duration do

524
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,240
something what do we want to do

525
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,440
think about um something for it wasn't

526
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,679
for a duration okay then hold it hold it

527
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,520
when we get to let's let's finish the

528
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,640
duration and then then yeah then we'll

529
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:22,559
get to the John a choice

530
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:26,000
variable quarter half and duration great

531
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,880
so Random Choice what's while I start

532
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,799
typing this out what goes after the endu

533
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,640
duration

534
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:38,120
do quarter half

535
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:41,559
E I don't remember What's this

536
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:44,000
called unhelpful it's called the type

537
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:50,200
the type quarter length we'd have to say

538
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,320
we could put it in as one two2 yep one

539
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,050
let's see if that makes it a little

540
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,799
bit nicer

541
00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:00,440
[Music]

542
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,020
it's actually already

543
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,799
nicer usually this doesn't help as

544
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,919
[Music]

545
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,279
much

546
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,039
okay next Improvement I'm just going to

547
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:17,960
keep going on this yeah you

548
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:21,279
can what's that up a third go yep it can

549
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:25,600
go up a third or down a third now do we

550
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,600
want to make it a weigh probability at

551
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,720
all so how much more we want it up a

552
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,799
third is minus two because we're

553
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,600
thinking um in computer think not in

554
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,600
music theory think so that would be

555
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:45,519
unweighed and how do we want away this

556
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,480
to make it feel more

557
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:51,080
musical higher weight on stepwise motion

558
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,080
higher weight on

559
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:59,600
stepwise 1 negative 1 one one okay let's

560
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,600
try that

561
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:10,910
[Music]

562
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,440
he that's our first

563
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,000
step not not so good okay so we still

564
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,720
need some things that's that's definite

565
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Improvement thank you uh another another

566
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,159
thing to improve let's

567
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,279
keep yeah Jon decrease the weight on

568
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,760
staying on the same note decrease the

569
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,600
weight on staying on the same note okay

570
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,039
so what we can do is the easiest way

571
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,120
when you're programming really fast in

572
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,640
front of a class do that is cut and

573
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,279
paste don't do this in your actual

574
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,320
things you turn in but cut and paste and

575
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,320
just delete the that zero is that

576
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,840
good it's already looks a little bit

577
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,480
better I want next let's do another

578
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:03,799
Improvement on rhythm

579
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,519
yeah it's they have not starting

580
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,799
on

581
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,799
on okay good so we want to try to weigh

582
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,200
it somehow so that we're we have notes

583
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,880
that start on the downbeat more talk

584
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,320
with your neighbor on how you might

585
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,440
Implement

586
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,600
that okay let's let's come back together

587
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,600
uh

588
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,399
anybody okay let's let's jump in while

589
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,840
well and we'll try to program it

590
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,720
together because we'll do this in class

591
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,360
somebody I haven't heard from yet want

592
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,640
to give a

593
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,640
suggestion hasn't

594
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:44,440
spoken try to keep track of an offset

595
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,760
and then based on the offset so have a

596
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,799
different probability based on the

597
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,279
offset What What offsets In currently

598
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,279
with the default time signature 44 why

599
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,720
do we make that default very hit demonic

600
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,880
but okay um what what offsets represent

601
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,519
the

602
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,519
um the uh

603
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,240
downbeat anybody

604
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,120
can zero zero definitely represents a

605
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,480
downbeat what other

606
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,440
offsets so have we been creating

607
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,960
measures by the way first off let's look

608
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,440
at that so we've kind of um taking uh

609
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,240
advantage of Music 21 or some something

610
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,039
creating measures for us so our offsets

611
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,880
we start with zero and then we're just

612
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,880
appending so so what's our next

613
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:38,559
downbeat four good good and somebody

614
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,360
else what's what's our general formula

615
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,640
we're going to find

616
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,360
for

617
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:50,039
downbeat Zer

618
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:55,159
mod yeah then uh we could check if the

619
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:58,880
if the um off offset is um mod 4 is zero

620
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:01,519
right so let's so we'll get to before we

621
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,880
um before we do that so let's say what's

622
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,480
our

623
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,799
current offset so one of the things we

624
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,320
can do is we can keep track of our

625
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:13,440
current offset now we're going to wish

626
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,200
we had um 0.0 now we're going to wish we

627
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,840
had done this as quarter lengths so I'm

628
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,240
going to rewrite this as quarter

629
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,960
length why because it's easier to add

630
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,960
quarter lengths than it is types right

631
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:37,840
so one to 0.5 and we'll just

632
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:41,279
say ql

633
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,279
equals random

634
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,880
Choice okay so what we can do

635
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,639
is well now I'm just going to make sure

636
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:58,000
that I still have a current thing and

637
00:31:51,639 --> 00:32:00,480
Cur offset plus equals ql

638
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,480
so I haven't done anything to adjust our

639
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,679
probability yet just making sure that

640
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,480
this works yep it still generate sign so

641
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,519
how how can we use this to implement the

642
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,039
great suggestion that we want to have

643
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,279
things that fit on the downbeat more

644
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,720
often um do something else so we'll say

645
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:22,679
is on

646
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,279
downbeat equals uh Cur

647
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:30,159
offset per

648
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:32,559
zero you got say equals um here we could

649
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,320
say true this is the easiest way if

650
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:40,120
current offset Mod 0 equals 0 else false

651
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,320
um you can do it you can realize that

652
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,600
that Boolean expression will be you know

653
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,840
reduce itself but I like to be explicit

654
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,360
when I'm thinking um so now we know if

655
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,279
something's on the downbeat what do we

656
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,279
want to how do we want to do it

657
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,840
differently do you need to brainstorm

658
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,880
torm thanks Adam I want to want to hear

659
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,679
from some some more voices um even

660
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,679
though you're doing great good Vanessa

661
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,480
yeah uh and if it's not on the downbeat

662
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:25,039
it as what it was before you leave it as

663
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,799
what it was before let's try that um oh

664
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:32,440
yeah so we have a last Q so we'll Define

665
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,840
ql outside of here uh will be pretty

666
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,840
pythonic uh equals what we'll say our

667
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,720
last one is zero was one we're actually

668
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,840
not going to um because we all will

669
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,480
always start on the downbeat ql will be

670
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,720
defined but let's do good programming

671
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:53,960
techniques and Define it outside good so

672
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,960
if is on if not is on

673
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,720
downbeat okay let's see if that

674
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,440
otherwise we're just going to stay on

675
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,799
whatever we were on before let's see

676
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,879
we'll think it through first will that

677
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,359
did I get one ql will have a not defied

678
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,040
error I think

679
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,639
it oh sorry yep that's why we that's why

680
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,760
I was talking about defining it good

681
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,399
good catch though um always don't no

682
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,599
crashed 787s because of not defined

683
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,520
errors that's a famous story um okay so

684
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,599
let's make um let's make sure that we're

685
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,079
not going to end up permanently like uh

686
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:36,800
syncopated or something we start on the

687
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,560
downbeat and then we choose between

688
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:44,359
maybe I should put these in some sort of

689
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:46,119
logical order 2 1 0.5 we randomly choose

690
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:48,399
between half note quarter note and

691
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,119
eighth note and we're on the Down Beat

692
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,919
and so we're going to stay on that for a

693
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,079
bit will we always end up back on a down

694
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,639
be at some

695
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,640
point we start on a Down Beat we choose

696
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,640
2 1 0

697
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,760
.5 in this particular piece who votes

698
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,760
yes who votes we might be permanently

699
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,599
syncopated

700
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,720
ah spend more time reading code than

701
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,960
writing

702
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,480
code it looks like we might yeah because

703
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,520
like it only switches the quarter length

704
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,880
if

705
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,800
we're not on the down did I do that

706
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,520
wrong do we want to keep it we wanted to

707
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,599
do I have a misplaced

708
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,800
knot so that's what we wanted a little

709
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,400
bit right if we if we're on the downbeat

710
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,560
we can change to a new Rhythm if we're

711
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,079
not we

712
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,560
can't think let's let's run let's

713
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,560
generate

714
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,560
this yeah so so what's the consequence

715
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,560
of this somebody else

716
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,599
y it's the same type of notes uh it's

717
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,160
the same type of notes every measure you

718
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,960
know what I'm going to change that over

719
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,000
oh no no we can't determine the length

720
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,800
of the piece right so we might um so we

721
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,319
might have that yeah every measure will

722
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,480
always have um the same type of thing I

723
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:22,480
it's kind of nice for a lot of my junior

724
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,240
high atude books were like this right

725
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,119
that you only switch rhythms but but

726
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,280
maybe what's what's one way that we can

727
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,440
switch a little bit better more often we

728
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,480
could just say um I mean we should

729
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,880
rename our variables but maybe this will

730
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,370
feel much more unified we'll just do it

731
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:48,400
on every two

732
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:50,599
[Music]

733
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,800
does okay that's enough that's already

734
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:56,480
becoming more more unified so what what

735
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,520
are some things that we could hack into

736
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,920
this

737
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,160
we're not we're done for a little bit

738
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,200
but

739
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,200
um what's some things that we can make

740
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
it sound a little bit more

741
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,160
human Harmony we could add Harmony good

742
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,119
we could add random or appropriate

743
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,960
probably more appropriate yeah Jason we

744
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,200
could allow it to occasionally break

745
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,599
these rules by well probably by random

746
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,359
chance but so certain random chance that

747
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,119
would break the rules yeah uh one of the

748
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,720
things here I'm not going to do this but

749
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,599
I gave a particular random chance that

750
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,520
um that something might uh go up an

751
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:41,040
octave in another time when I did this

752
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,800
and um there was some danger in allowing

753
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,319
that um this is a particular problem

754
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,119
with Muse score that if you overflow

755
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:52,160
256 uh it jumps it's uh unsigned which

756
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,119
is kind of cool that that the world of

757
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:59,800
notation wraps around um but yeah but so

758
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,880
I obviously was what was allowing this

759
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,040
one random seven is an octave if you're

760
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,520
adding to it to happen a little too

761
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,520
often so that that can be a danger but

762
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,760
it happens thanks for gra that um yeah

763
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,800
so those are some of the other things

764
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,000
you can do maybe we want it to sound a

765
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,319
little less now I'm going to start doing

766
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,839
this I just need to not make it full

767
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:23,520
screen you can make it a little bit less

768
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,160
human and make it do these weird micro

769
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,319
tones or not less human but less um sort

770
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,599
of traditional right and and where' that

771
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:33,599
go uh here here we can hear it these

772
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:40,219
[Music]

773
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,280
unfortunately so there there are ways

774
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,800
that you can do something things um that

775
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,880
allow you to you know be more

776
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,359
experimental if you want or less

777
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,560
experimental great

778
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,319
um so we'll keep playing with that what

779
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,240
you'll probably um realize one of the

780
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:01,560
things we're building up to so you're

781
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,240
given a problem Set uh problem set 78 as

782
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,400
I said it's um not in the 78 time that'd

783
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,720
be too lops side it's in um but what it

784
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,079
is is it gives you um some work with

785
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,760
scales and with Roman numerals and then

786
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,800
there's two parts for you to do an

787
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,359
open-ended thing one is we're going to

788
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,359
be asking you in the first half to write

789
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:25,480
a Roman numeral analyzer just for

790
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,599
Triads um in

791
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,319
major and it's just going to be for

792
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,319
Block chords I'll be I'll give you I'll

793
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,079
give you three notes you tell me what

794
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:36,599
ran numeral it is uh if you've if you're

795
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,760
a little bit behind uh if you sorry if

796
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,680
you if it's been a while since you've

797
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,760
done Roman numeral analysis or you feel

798
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,880
a little bit weak on it you know

799
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,720
collaborate talk with other people on

800
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,319
that make sure that you're really clear

801
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,480
what a diminish Triad and all that

802
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:54,160
things is um so grab somebody before you

803
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,640
leave the room and then there's a little

804
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,440
open-ended thing where I just ask you do

805
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,160
something a little bit more maybe you

806
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,440
have something that works in minor maybe

807
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,359
you have it do seventh chords maybe you

808
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,280
work in jazz and popular music and you

809
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,040
think Roman numer rals oh that's only

810
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,160
for classical music I'm going to have it

811
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,680
do chord symbols C and things like that

812
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,160
instead so whatever you want there'll be

813
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,079
just a small uh part of it I should have

814
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,240
it open in fact I think I no I only have

815
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,160
it with all the answers open never

816
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:28,280
mind and then the last part is

817
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,680
um I want an algorithmic conf opposition

818
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,760
that you like it could be multi-art it

819
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,240
could be single part if it's interesting

820
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,119
it could be with chords without chords

821
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,480
but just something where you've done

822
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,720
some sort of interesting music theory

823
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,560
I'll I'll say that what we've given here

824
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,079
is the quential D minus so far try to go

825
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,400
better than n maybe it's a d actually by

826
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,119
this point we're getting to we're

827
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,079
getting a little bit better don't spend

828
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,880
the entire semester on it this is not

829
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,680
meant to be the gigantic project that

830
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,000
you take forever on um the only

831
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,599
restriction I'm giving is um that I'd

832
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,359
like it to be about a minute long not

833
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,000
two minutes long not 12 minutes long

834
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,319
because uh I have to uh if everybody

835
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
turns in a 10-minute composition then

836
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,040
I'll be listening to algorithmic

837
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,800
compositions uh forever um so if you can

838
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,000
uh do that that's going to be that main

839
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,359
part um any questions about what we did

840
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,240
with kind of playing around with

841
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,240
algorithmic composition

842
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:41,040
today okay uh then I'm going to be uh

843
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:45,160
little egotistical for a second and um

844
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,560
and talk about um what one of my first

845
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,440
uh algorithmic compositions that got per

846
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,160
that at some point people were

847
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,920
performing um and it's a piece for this

848
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,200
group called The bang Onan Allstars

849
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,680
which uh some of you might recognize the

850
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,800
clarinetist is zorin so another

851
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:04,079
professor who's here um who does a lot

852
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,800
of things and um it was based on Markoff

853
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,760
chains so the notion uh that what I

854
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,440
wanted was some kind of a Melody that

855
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,880
was a little bit boring a little not

856
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,000
boring but but just sort of

857
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,400
undistinguished except it had these

858
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
weird bumps in it some things that

859
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,480
sounded a little bit weird like this

860
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,480
opening

861
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,480
trone and then some these weird gestures

862
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,520
Y and so some things that you hear

863
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,920
enough times you're like okay I know

864
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,640
that that's what the piece is about and

865
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,760
try to see if in the um this is I can't

866
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,880
remember when is from 2005 it was a

867
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,559
little bit it was pre- deep learning and

868
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,520
things so just probability Theory um

869
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,400
whether or not the computer would the

870
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,040
Markoff chain would do some interesting

871
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,800
things with this and then one of the

872
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,800
things I really wanted was someplace

873
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,119
like an old record player that would get

874
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:58,040
stuck in a in a loop and um need to be

875
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,119
judged out of it so I have a few play

876
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,680
where um the same thing happens over and

877
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,119
over and over again if you're thinking

878
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,760
about what we were talking about the end

879
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:12,720
of last class about the probability of B

880
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:15,079
given a the next note or we could say N2

881
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,880
given

882
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,400
N1 uh this is what order markof chain

883
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,240
are we talking about

884
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,480
here first order right based on one

885
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,359
previous note I used a bunch of

886
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,760
different orders in this U piece

887
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,400
depending on how random I wanted

888
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,800
it to be um I wanted that when you got

889
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,640
to that note

890
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,800
a that the probability given a was very

891
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,800
high that you

892
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:44,720
would do another a so I sort of weighed

893
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,920
the probability so the probability of an

894
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,240
a given an a was I don't know something

895
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,160
like 0.9 or something so the computer

896
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,960
would get stuck in this particular

897
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:58,839
Groove at some

898
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:02,839
points um and we'll see what I would do

899
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:05,119
at some points is just keep the melody

900
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:07,960
um just keep the notes and let the

901
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:13,520
rhythms be out but uh if this is treble

902
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:16,119
cleff that's an opening gesture of b f

903
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,680
comes back a lot BF and

904
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,119
there's you'll hear that a lot and then

905
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,640
getting stuck in that a Groove

906
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,319
again you you'll hear

907
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,720
that and what I did was back the old

908
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:32,400
days I just had it generate a whole

909
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:37,000
bunch of Melodies and I kept the ones I

910
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,000
wanted so I wanted to do my computer um

911
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,480
type of

912
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,720
thing uh one last little thing is that I

913
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,760
had this sort of

914
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,480
um progression that begins one beat per

915
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,599
second so 60 BPM then moves there was a

916
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,680
section of 1.5 beats per second two

917
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:59,559
three four and then the final note is a

918
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,880
dissonance that vibrates five beats per

919
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,119
second so that's kind of the little

920
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,920
Easter egg in the piece and then I took

921
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,160
the 1.5 beats per second and moved it

922
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,520
because that's what composers

923
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,559
do uh when I when when the piece was

924
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,960
premiered uh they'll never be happy with

925
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,839
me at the printing office again um I

926
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,599
gave every person in the audience a

927
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,720
different set of program notes that

928
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,520
began by saying the end the opening of

929
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,400
the piece is rather straightforward and

930
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,119
then I wrote about 10 pages is worth of

931
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,680
program notes and everyone got a markof

932
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,400
chain of the program notes so it has U

933
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,839
something kind of looks like something

934
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,040
then uh it ended with but always with a

935
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:41,920
hint of order no matter what they had so

936
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,400
um I'm just going to be indulgent and

937
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,180
play a little bit of something I wrote a

938
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,550
while back

941
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,480

947
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,720
and here's where I let the computer

948
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,720
start taking over

949
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:30,040

950
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,040

953
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:12,800
I think I told the computer to multiply

954
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,800
the intervals by two for more leapy

955
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:48,060

958
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,319
this is completely markof chained here

[Music]

960
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,520
you can kind of hear where it's stuck

961
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:39,280
again

anytime you see a two measure repeat the

00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,359

972
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,520
let's do this

973
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,920
to yeah thanks everybody you don't need

974
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,119
to write that much please don't write

975
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,280
that much for your algorithmic

976
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:11,559
composition but feel free to have a

977
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,359
mixture of your own personality and your

978
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:19,079
own desires and let the computer do some

979
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:19,079
things that kind of inspires you
