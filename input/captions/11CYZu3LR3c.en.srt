interest uh I just was going to give a

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,640
very brief overview of dusp the

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,879
Department of urban studies and planning

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
here at MIT some of my own perspectives

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,200
on this idea of a smart City based on my

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,239
own work but mostly talk about some of

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,520
the works of other colleagues in our

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:51,160
department um other than the great ones

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,000
that you will actually hear from later

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,280
on uh today um can you please and we are

22

represent a range of fields and

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,960
disciplines Urban Design to anthropology

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,240
engineering to economics uh law

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,680
epidemiology computer science planning

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,159
among many others um and while we are a

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,680
highly multi-disciplinary faculty who

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
truly span the globe in our research um

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,400
in our teaching and our collaborations

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
we are united in our mission if you

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,079
could please advance um and that is to

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,759
prepare leaders to plan design and

40
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,960
create communities in places that are

41
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,200
socially economically and

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,040
environmentally just uh we we've

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,840
operationalized this message through

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,479
sorry this m mission through four

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,079
strategic priorities achieving racial

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,439
and economic Justice um tackling the

47
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,280
climate crisis and enhancing

48
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,680
multi-racial Democratic governance um

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,520
and um we uh aim to fulfill this Mission

50
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,880
if you could please Advance through all

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,759
aspects of our teaching research and

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,039
departmental culture and external

53
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,280
collaborations with three basic guiding

54
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,719
principles if you could please Advance

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
um this includes um providing a learning

56
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,440
environment that can nurture the next

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,879
generation of

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,800
leaders um generate knowledge through a

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,720
range of methods and disciplines working

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
closely uh through long-term

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,480
Partnerships with people in specific

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,959
places for a global scale impact if you

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,599
could please Advance the

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,879
slides

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,760
um I guess maybe the slides are not

66
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,319
advancing um uh and integrating across

67
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,000
our teaching our research Arch our

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,400
external Partnerships to always Foster

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,760
um a supportive and inclusive culture of

70
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,599
creativity and experimentation um if you

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,640
could please Advance uh we have a broad

72
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,959
and thriving research ecosystem that

73
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,200
operates through a range of

74
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,159
action-oriented labs some of whom you'll

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,480
hear from today including sensible City

76
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,280
lab and the city form lab um and I what

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,680
I think is somewhat unique about our

78
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,000
work relative to MIT um more broadly and

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,519
it's because it's fundamental to the

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,519
field of planning is is that we have

81
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,400
direct and deep engagement with

82
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,040
stakeholders um uh this includes um

83
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,239
community members um uh government

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
agencies uh Transit operators other um

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
public private Partnerships and of

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
course a range of private companies uh

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,560
through work of some of which you hear

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
today again like sensible City and the

89
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,280
city for lab and the Civic data Design

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,560
Lab um typically we we have to engage

91
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,920
across these and other types of

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,879
stakeholders when we do our work um when

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,080
we think about City Planning

94
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,840
um you know the Enterprise of the city

95
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,319
development we're trying to maximize

96
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,560
quality of life through the provision of

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,560
Mobility Health livelihoods shelter Etc

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,280
um and we engage in this work through a

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,760
range of um methods tools and means

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,319
including economic and financial

101
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,080
analysis Community engagement the design

102
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,959
of cities physically and of course we

103
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,319
use Computing for design analysis

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,200
machine learning for inference etc etc

105
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,280
these are not mutually exclusive methods

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,599
in fact typically we bring them together

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,439
um uh because you know we can use for

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
example computer D driven design

109
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,840
analysis and you'll hear a little about

110
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,840
about that later on today from my

111
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,879
colleague Andre seon um if you could

112
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,799
please Advance our our research

113
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
ecosystem as I said is pretty rich we

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,280
have a range of types of projects these

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,359
projects do focus in our strategic

116
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,639
priorities that I mentioned earlier and

117
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,680
I you'll hear a few of these today I

118
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,919
encourage you to go look at our website

119
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,479
to um where you can learn in much more

120
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,880
depth the range of research projects

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,400
that we've been undertaking over the

122
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,800
last decade or so at least now if you

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,360
could please advance I want to get to

124
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,800
this topic of smart cities um when we

125
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,320
think about smart cities I think we

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,560
normally start thinking about Computing

127
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,120
and devices data science and AI right of

128
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,240
course that's a key piece of it um DP

129
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,080
itself has been very much at the

130
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,919
Forefront of integrating Computing into

131
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,080
planning since the very early days in

132
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,680
fact um and we all know that these

133
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,000
capabilities are not just changing today

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,840
the way we do planning um but also uh

135
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,320
what we um um what how we plan what

136
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,639
we're planning for um I view always I

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
think we need to view competing as the

138
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,880
means to the ends you know and if we

139
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,759
think about this in terms of um the four

140
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
dimensions that I think are relevant for

141
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,759
data um for for planning this includes

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,560
data visualization data collection

143
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,759
modeling and simulation uh visualization

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
and control and

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,840
optimization um again I said that's has

146
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,479
been at the Forefront of this this

147
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,800
includes it recently we have a

148
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,360
partnership with the College of

149
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,440
computing um um and the computer science

150
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,039
department with an undergrad degree in

151
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,319
um we call

152
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,199
116 um uh urban planning and computer

153
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,840
science uh or sorry Urban science and

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,479
planning with computer science and

155
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,680
currently we're in the midst of a search

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,280
for a shared appointment with the

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
College of computing in the areas of

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,000
computing and health of the planet um if

159
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,639
you could please Advance um well I'll

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,199
skip over this in the interest of time I

161
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,400
think what I want to just keep in mind

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,360
here this this this um Cube that I I

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
show here puts the values front and

164
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,039
center once more I think any our our our

165
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,720
leveraging of computing of capabilities

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,759
to help do um the work we need to do to

167
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,840
create a a high quality of life for

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,720
people is always driven by our values

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,319
that believe in equity accountability

170
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,639
transparency and and inclusivity um if

171
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,120
you could please advance to the next

172
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,720
slide once more when we think about

173
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,160
smart cities I think many of us

174
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,840
immediately think about devices and the

175
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,199
power epitomize for example in a

176
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,160
smartphone um and if you could please

177
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,639
Advance my own work has actually been

178
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,840
relatedly focused over time um you know

179
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,479
oh I we have these Computing

180
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,080
capabilities how might we use these to

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,680
plan better but I think I'd like us to

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,960
step back a little bit if we may just

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,639
for a moment to inspire a bit this this

184
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,160
concept a bit more profoundly um you

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,199
know I think we should fundamentally

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,880
revisit this premise if you could please

187
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,160
Advance um cities have always been smart

188
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,639
right they're the smartest places on the

189
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
planet because of the concentrations of

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,400
people and firms and the spillovers that

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,199
we're all familiar with that we can call

192
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,560
marcelian economies or glomeration

193
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,479
economies C cities are where Innovation

194
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,199
happens and so I'd like us to be

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,759
thinking about people Centric people

196
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,759
first smart cities dusp is fortunate

197
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,919
enough to have many colleagues uh who

198
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,199
are pioneering work in this field I

199
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,199
highlight for example the work of

200
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,360
Mariana Araya who's a planner and a

201
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,840
social epidemiologist she led the

202
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,919
development of the healthy neighborhoods

203
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,680
Consortium which is an initiative which

204
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,840
actually starts the research Enterprise

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,879
first and foremost with close

206
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,919
collaboration with communities this idea

207
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,160
of generating resident researchers

208
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,599
mobilizing and co-developing projects

209
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,879
with them her work has proved to be in

210
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,080
in incredibly pre for example in

211
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,000
predicting where covid would outbreak

212
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,240
first and who would be most Gravely

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,960
affected by covid because um the the

214
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,240
sensors the most high resolution sensors

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,120
are actually people in place um and so

216
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,319
this work leverages this um she's

217
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,400
currently doing some work with

218
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,120
communities and colleagues in

219
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,639
architecture on how we can model

220
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,879
building energy retrofits for the most

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,960
benefit of the people who live in those

222
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,039
buildings as another example um if you

223
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,720
could please advance another great

224
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,039
example comes from my colleague cath

225
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,960
diasio who's worked quite closely with

226
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,440
regional networks um across Latin

227
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,360
America both activists and Scholars and

228
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,039
the work has been focused on how we can

229
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,400
reduce the exposure to violence

230
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,479
particularly violence against women um

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,319
and the nature of the work uses AI to do

232
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,599
a better job but to identify the

233
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,840
violence that's not otherwise observed

234
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,440
um so AI comes in the back end here

235
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,280
through machine learning classifiers and

236
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,919
so forth but the critical Dimension is

237
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,120
that the whole process is participatory

238
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,440
um the the building of the technology um

239
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,519
and um designing what the task actually

240
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,800
should be how to construct for example

241
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,399
proper samples for training data how to

242
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,719
create the schema uh for uh for labeling

243
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,959
data um for the evaluation of the

244
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,399
approach and for further guiding

245
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,399
additional data collection and a

246
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,839
critical aspect here has not only been

247
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
the technology but more importantly I

248
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,320
would I would say she would agree with

249
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,959
me has been the community that has been

250
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,440
generated across the region that is

251
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,640
actively working with these tools on a

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,240
critical dimension of um that's

253
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,720
affecting the region if you could

254
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,600
advance I just wanted to talk quickly

255
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,760
about one other project my colleague

256
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,880
Caroline Crockett who has this project

257
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,160
that she calls um hacking the archives

258
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,160
so hacking of course is a very MIT uh um

259
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,839
um uh uh typical MIT inherently MIT

260
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,040
approach but it's merged with this

261
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,680
historical Memorial AR approach of

262
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,360
archiving which is a basically aimed at

263
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
challenging traditional knowledge

264
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
hierarchies and social exclusions if you

265
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
could please Advance sorry that should

266
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,680
have been at that next slide I won't

267
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,519
have time to get into it in detail um

268
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,279
but just a a few if you could Advance

269
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,760
please um if you um

270
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,760
uh um one more slide please so her work

271
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,920
through a participatory process is focus

272
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,519
on topics of fundamental concern to

273
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,440
communities such as the racial wealth

274
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,360
Gap um so she's generated projects that

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,600
have focused on this uh particular

276
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,600
Dimension if you advert it merges

277
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,800
essentially the social and the digital

278
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,320
if you could advance to another slide um

279
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,120
I just in the interest of time I'll have

280
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
to jump over this if you could Advance

281
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,320
also to the next slide um she's uh

282
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,440
including focusing on issues of cultural

283
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,640
relevance such as um the the history of

284
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,240
jazz um uh please advance in short I

285
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,839
believe her this work that I've

286
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
highlighted quite briefly represents

287
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,760
just another critical and

288
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,440
underappreciated and underutilized

289
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,720
approach to the traditional Smart City

290
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,320
rhetoric and practice right bringing

291
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,880
traditional methods merging them with

292
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,120
the Advanced Digital Technologies um to

293
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
actually bring projects that are deeply

294
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,959
meaningful to the people that inhabit

295
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
the places that are fundamental to this

296
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,800
whole concept of smart city so if you

297
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,360
could advance to the last slide i' just

298
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,800
like to end to highlight a few

299
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,880
principles that I'd like all Smart City

300
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,920
practitioners aspirants and others to

301
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,000
keep front and center in the pursuit of

302
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,519
their work this um is um you know

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,959
starting with a fundamental theory of

304
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,279
change of what we think we're trying to

305
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,880
achieve with this work recognizing that

306
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,079
we're often working in communities that

307
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
made reconciliation and reparation all

308
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,920
of this work should be transparent it

309
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,800
should be deeply embedded in context and

310
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,519
history epitomized in the work for

311
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,360
example of um Carolyn Crockett focus on

312
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,560
uplifting the assets and the agency of

313
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,560
the communities that we're working in

314
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,760
protecting those same people from um

315
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,040
potential violations or concerns with

316
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,959
respect to how we do research and then

317
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,399
ultimately sending uh centering the

318
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,040
leadership of communities in this type

319
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,760
of work not only in doing the work but

320
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,839
decisions based on this work again the

321
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,160
work the the the the projects that

322
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,279
Mariana Araya has has led um epitomize

323
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,240
this and then always in a fundamentally

324
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,399
Pro a fundamental process of continuous

325
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,440
critique and self-reflection again

326
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,920
involving those same communities so that

327
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,320
we are we are sure we're actually

328
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,440
embracing the smart city

329
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,600
concept with a people first perspective

330
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,639
um I appreciate so much your time thanks

331
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,279
gram for the invitation I Greatful for

332
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,720
the opportunity to share some of this

333
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,040
with you today and looking forward to

334
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,959
the rest of this event thank you very

335
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,880
much Professor Zoras for the inside for

336
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,360
open

337
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:12,639
remark that actually set up set the

338
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,639
perfect stage for today's discussions
