1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,520
Okay,

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,320
recall. So, of course, I'm going to go

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,880
over a few things from last time.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,840
Suppose

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,199
we have

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,199
a subi things

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,960
of size.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,399
So these could be um well I mean they

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,399
could be Dick Walts

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:54,399
in which case a subi is the Catalan

11
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:57,760
number and um the generating function

12
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,480
is summation

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,535
a subi x.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,479
Okay the notes generally use n

15
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:07,040
[clears throat] for this. So I'm going

16
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,320
to try to do that but

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,799
I'm probably going to um

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,799
not be consistent. The general question

19
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,520
is a of x

20
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,560
a subn x to the n

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,439
and equals well let's say 0 to infinity

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,400
but I

23
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:31,200
we you know maybe we want to start

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,799
counting at one in certain cases.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,280
Okay.

26
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,280
And suppose

27
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,240
we have two classes of things,

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,759
a sub i and b sub i

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,479
like that. A subn and B subn and C subn

30
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,920
equals

31
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:07,560
A subn plus B subn where C is the union

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,560
of A and B

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,080
or the disjoint union. Then

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,520
C of X is equal to A of X plus B of X.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,599
And suppose

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,440
C equals the direct product of A and B

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,760
where the size of C.

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,200
So C = A comma B

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,440
something from A and something from B.

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:00,920
So the size of C is equal to size

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,920
of A plus size of B.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,200
N C subn= summation

43
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,959
i= 0 to n a sub i

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,840
b

45
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,640
sub n minus i

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,360
because you know if you want two things

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,080
to sum to n one should be i and the

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,400
other should be n minus i and c of x is

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,400
equal to

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
a of x times vx.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,519
And there's one last

52
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,400
way of manipulating generating functions

53
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,480
that we should that I did not discuss

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,840
last time.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
Actually, there's more than that. I

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,200
mean, you can differentiate them and

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,120
integrate them, but I gave you an

58
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,200
example of that last time. But

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,599
um

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,599
let's let

61
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,040
sequence of a

62
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,040
b be

63
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,000
a set of finite SEQUENCES

64
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,360
OF THINGS IN

65
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,400
SO let's

66
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,400
do an example that will illustrate this.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Suppose

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,000
a is equal to

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,479
0 and one.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,240
sequence of A is equal to

71
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,160
binary springs.

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Oops.

73
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,199
0

74
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,600
is an Aub

75
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,600
for example.

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,120
So what is the generating function for

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,120
sequence of a

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,840
Uh, I want to claim

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,639
s of x

80
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,199
is equal to sum from i zero.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Um

82
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,160
n = 0 to infinity

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
a

84
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,960
okay let's write it out first

85
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:44,560
is = 1 + a of x

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,240
plus a of x^2

87
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,800
+ a of x cubed.

88
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,800
So this is the empty sequence.

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,520
This is

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,520
0 and 1.

91
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,240
This would be 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 for binary

92
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,240
sequences

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,240
etc.

94
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:19,000
And a of x= 2x

95
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,000
for binary SEQUENCES

96
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:30,360
because you know here there are two

97
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,360
binary sequences of length one and

98
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,120
x means length one here and two means

99
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,120
there are two of them.

100
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,400
So

101
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:50,240
s of x is =

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:54,479
1 + 2x + 4 x^2 + 8 x cub + dot dot dot

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,280
which you probably all recognize as 1 /

104
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,280
1 - 2x.

105
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:07,960
We can go up here and say this = 1 / 1 -

106
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
ax.

107
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,160
So this is

108
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,840
I guess this calculation is not very

109
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,879
impressive for binary strings because

110
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,080
everybody knows how to come up with this

111
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,280
in much easier ways. But we will next

112
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,120
what we're going to do is we're going to

113
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,120
do Fibonacci numbers and Fibonacci

114
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,760
numbers are

115
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,360
a little bit harder and we will see that

116
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,000
the generating function actually gives

117
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,000
you interesting things for Fibonacci

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
numbers.

119
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,040
Okay.

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
So

121
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,600
let's start with another question.

122
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Suppose

123
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,600
we want to send information over a

124
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,880
send

125
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,880
information

126
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,959
over

127
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,959
a telegraph type channel

128
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,800
where

129
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,680
we can send

130
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,399
dot and a dash.

131
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,920
And the question is how much information

132
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,920
or how many messages can we send?

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,279
Can we send

134
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,480
time

135
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,440
n? And I forgot to tell you, a dot has

136
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,040
length one

137
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,040
and a dash has length two.

138
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,079
Okay,

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,240
let's start

140
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,959
um

141
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,600
calculating it with one

142
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,760
with time one.

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,800
All we can do is send a dot. So that's

144
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,040
not really a message. That's just I mean

145
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,360
if you can only send one message, it

146
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
contains no information.

147
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,000
and time two, we could either send the

148
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,000
dash or two dots.

149
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,839
Um, and time three. So that's two

150
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,640
possibilities. Here's one possibility.

151
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,279
In time three, we can either send a dash

152
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,160
and a dot or a dot and a dash or three

153
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,640
dots. That's three.

154
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,200
And time for

155
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:12,399
send dot dot

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:16,160
dot or dash dash dash dot dot dot

157
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,920
dot dot dash and dot dot dot dot. So

158
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,640
that's five messages. Does anybody

159
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,640
recognize this sequence?

160
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,640
Okay, let's do the next one.

161
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,680
Well, there are two dashes and a dot or

162
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:39,760
a dot and two dashes or dash dot dash.

163
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,160
And we can

164
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,560
dash and three dots

165
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:51,040
dot dash dot dot dot dot dash dot dot

166
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,680
dot dot dash and dot dot dot dot

167
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,640
um dot. So there's eight of these

168
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,640
things.

169
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,720
Okay, do people recognize the sequence

170
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,959
now?

171
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,360
Um, what is it?

172
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,760
>> Fibonacci numbers. Yeah. So, we get the

173
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,839
Fibonacci numbers. And actually, there's

174
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,608
a very easy way to prove that we get the

175
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,628
Fibonacci numbers. We

176
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,628
[clears throat]

177
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm going to claim F sub N= F -1 + F sub

178
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,160
N - 2

179
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,160
So this is

180
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,880
if something ends with a dot. So uh

181
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,639
sequence of length n is either going to

182
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,279
lend with a dot or a dash. If it ends

183
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,480
with a dot then there are fn minus one

184
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,800
ways of putting filling the first n

185
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,560
minus one time units. and ends with a

186
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,880
dash there are fn minus2 ways of filling

187
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,000
the first n minus two times.

188
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,440
So you get this recurrence for the

189
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,120
Fibonacci numbers which I'm sure

190
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,720
everybody already knows about.

191
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,279
So what we're going to do is we're going

192
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,600
to ask how can we use generating

193
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,869
functions to find a formula for the eth

194
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,889
Fibonacci network.

195
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,889
[clears throat]

196
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,839
And

197
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,760
I want to say something

198
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,360
back when our lecture notes were first

199
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,839
written,

200
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,839
I used,

201
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:18,079
you know, f_sub_1 = 1, f0 zero.

202
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,040
There's one way of sending message of

203
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,800
length zero

204
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:29,199
which is the empty message. So f_sub_0 =

205
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:34,680
1, f_sub_1 = 1, f_sub_2 = 2, f_sub_3= 3,

206
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,680
f_sub_4= 5 etc. So,

207
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,079
um

208
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,079
since then,

209
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,920
um Wikipedia has

210
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,079
um

211
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,880
you know,

212
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,040
Wikipedia has installed itself as the

213
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,760
default um you know,

214
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,560
the default um arbiter of definitions

215
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,160
etc. And today

216
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,440
Wikipedia says f0 equals 0, f_sub_1= 1,

217
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,320
f_sub_2= 1, f_sub_3= 2, and everything

218
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,399
is shifted by one.

219
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,360
And I have not had time to rewrite the

220
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,000
notes. So the notes

221
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,959
disagree with Wikipedia's definition of

222
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,680
Fibonacci numbers. And you know today

223
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:32,240
Wikipedia basically is the default

224
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:37,600
definition for everything even if um

225
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,120
some even if some references disagree.

226
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,199
Okay.

227
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,040
So

228
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,079
um

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,680
and it's much easier to do this

230
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,440
calculation.

231
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,800
I think it's much easier to do this.

232
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,399
It's a little bit easier to do this

233
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
calculation if we use the alternate

234
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,000
definition rather than Wikipedia's

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,360
definition. But let's write down the

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,279
generic function for f of x.

237
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,680
f ofx

238
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,759
equals summation f ofx

239
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,440
summation

240
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,000
the i Fibonacci number * x to the nth

241
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:24,639
Fibonacci number * x to the n which is

242
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:33,199
equal to 1 + x + x^2

243
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:35,279
+ 3 x cubed + 5 x 4th + 8 x 5th + 13 x

244
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,839
dot dot dot.

245
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,399
Okay. So, how do we compute

246
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,959
the value? How do we find a closed form

247
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,959
for f ofx?

248
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,320
Let's um

249
00:16:49,360 --> 00:17:04,000
take x fx

250
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:08,480
= x + x^2 + 2 x cubed + 3 x 4 + 5 x 3r

251
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,480
and x2 fx

252
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:21,720
=

253
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:21,720
x2 + x cubed + 2 x 4 + 3 x plus dot dot.

254
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,280
Okay,

255
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,720
so now we have these three formulas. Can

256
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,720
anybody tell me what I should do with

257
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,720
them?

258
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:40,880
>> Subtract them. Very good. f ofx

259
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,000
- x f(x)

260
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,400
- x2 f(x)

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,840
equals

262
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,840
Can anybody tell me what this is?

263
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,919
One exactly. So it's one because

264
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,280
anything after the first term we have f

265
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,960
sub i f sub i minus one and f sub ius 2

266
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,679
and we take this and subtract that and

267
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:16,320
subtract that we get zero. The first

268
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:21,640
term doesn't quite work like that. We

269
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,640
take 1 - 0 - 0 and we get one.

270
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,360
And of course, this gives you the

271
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:33,919
equation f(x)

272
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:40,520
1 - x - x^2 = 1 or f(x)

273
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,520
= 1 / 1 - x - x^2.

274
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,520
Okay.

275
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,400
So how do we find a formula for f ofx

276
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,640
from this?

277
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,919
How many of you remember from calculus

278
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,919
um the method of partial fractions?

279
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,799
So some of you do. How many have never

280
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,799
seen the method of partial fractions?

281
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,120
Okay, so most of you remember it.

282
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,919
I mean

283
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
I guess there's some question as you

284
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,640
know

285
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:27,600
when we have Mathematica does anybody

286
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,960
need to remember how to integrate um

287
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,960
expressions but

288
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,520
I guess they haven't taken away all the

289
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,200
integration methods from calculus. this

290
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,440
yet.

291
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:49,880
Okay. So, what do we do?

292
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,880
We use the method of partial fractions.

293
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:10,720
We say 1 - x^ 2 = 1 - 5 +

294
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,720
1 - 5 -

295
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,480
and 5 +

296
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,120
5 minus

297
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,360
are the roots

298
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,799
of

299
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Well, what we're going to do is we're

300
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:37,400
going to reverse the order of these

301
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,400
coefficients and say y^ 2 - y - 1

302
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,320
And um

303
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,080
ah I forgot I forgot to put the x's in

304
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,080
this equation. So we

305
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:05,120
um yeah maybe I should explain why 5 + 5

306
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:08,159
- roots of y^ 2 - 1 - 1. So, y^ 2 - y -

307
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,480
1 = y -

308
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,320
y +

309
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,840
y - y -

310
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,440
And let's let x = 1 / y

311
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,919
1 /x^2 - 1x

312
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,919
- 1.

313
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Wait,

314
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:40,240
this should be y^2 + y - 1 y^2 + y - 1.

315
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:46,200
And now 1x^2

316
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,200
- + 1x - 1

317
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,280
=

318
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:02,360
1 /x - 5 +

319
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,360
1 /x - y -

320
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,520
I think I've done something wrong.

321
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,320
Let me think about this. So we want 1 -

322
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:48,280
x - x^2 =

323
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:48,280
Okay. And now we want y^2 + y.

324
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,919
This should be

325
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,720
if y is 1 /x

326
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,000
then this

327
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,159
corresponds to the one. This corresponds

328
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
to y. This corresponds to y^2. But this

329
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:14,600
really should be - y - y^2 + 1 equals

330
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,600
that. And now we have

331
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,720
That doesn't work.

332
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Okay.

333
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,880
Oh yeah.

334
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,880
Yeah, this is right.

335
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,600
Okay, good.

336
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,679
And multiplying both sides of this by

337
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,080
x^2,

338
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:32,480
we get

339
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,640
um 1 - 5 + x, 1 - 5 - x on the right

340
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,600
side. And we should get 1

341
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,600
- x -

342
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,400
x^2. So this should be a minus and this

343
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,200
should be a minus

344
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,200
and this should be a minus.

345
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,480
Yeah. Okay. Good.

346
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,840
So the roots of y^2

347
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,000
roots

348
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,600
are

349
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,679
-1.

350
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:16,400
No, 1 plus or minus the<unk> of 5 / 2 by

351
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,919
the um quadratic formula.

352
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,080
And

353
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:24,320
these are 5 + and 5 minus and 5 plus

354
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,799
will have the plus sign and 5 minus have

355
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,799
the minus sign.

356
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,840
Wait, no. I wanted I'm sorry. I wanted

357
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:44,919
to keep

358
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,919
um I want to keep this equation.

359
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Okay.

360
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:06,480
How did you get there? y^2 y.

361
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,480
>> Oh, so what I did was I replaced um y by

362
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,520
1 /x

363
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,520
and then multiply by y^2

364
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,159
um

365
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,360
and I clearly did this too fast because

366
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,600
I confused myself. So let's do it. And I

367
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,799
confused you too by going too fast. So

368
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:35,559
let's go over it more slowly.

369
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,559
Let's let y equ= 1 /x.

370
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:45,799
So this is 1 - 1 / y - 1 / y^ 2 is equal

371
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,799
to 1 -<unk>

372
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,400
+ y

373
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,039
1 -

374
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,039
y.

375
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,039
Okay.

376
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:09,520
And now multiply both sides by y^ 2. So

377
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:13,520
this is y^2 - y - y = y - 5 +

378
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:16,960
y - y -.

379
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:22,880
So 5 + is the largest root

380
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:29,000
of y^ 2 - y - 1. and y - is the smaller

381
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,000
root of y^2 - y - 1. So we have

382
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:43,640
y + is equal to 1 +<unk> 5 / 2 and 5 - =

383
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,640
1 -<unk> 5 / 2.

384
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,360
Okay.

385
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,360
So

386
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:17,559
okay. So what do we have? We have f ofx

387
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:30,240
= 1 / 1 - x - x^2

388
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:35,919
= 1 / 1 - 5 + x

389
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:38,480
1 - 5 - x. And by partial fractions, we

390
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,000
know this is equal to

391
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,760
a / 1 -

392
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:52,760
y + x.

393
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,760
+ b over 1 - 5 - x.

394
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,559
Okay. So, um

395
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,320
what do we do with this?

396
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,559
Well, let's

397
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,520
try to

398
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:31,520
solve this equation.

399
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:38,960
So this is equal to a * 1 - 5 - x

400
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:47,279
+ b * 1 - 5 + x over

401
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:50,320
1 - x - x^2 because this * this is 1 - x

402
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,679
- x^2.

403
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:58,799
So now we have this is equal to this. So

404
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:01,919
this gives us two equations. We have a +

405
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,919
b = 1

406
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,919
and

407
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:17,200
a 5 - x + b 5 a.

408
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:21,960
get a 55 - x + b 5 +

409
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,960
x = 0x.

410
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:30,640
Okay, so we have two equations.

411
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,960
We have two unknowns a and b and you

412
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,919
know how to solve them. And I am not

413
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,799
going to do it because it's a lot of

414
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:42,799
algebra and I quite possibly would screw

415
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:46,720
up somewhere along the way. and you know

416
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:53,440
how to do it anyway. So the answer comes

417
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:57,440
out to a = 1<unk> 5 *

418
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:01,600
1 +<unk> 5 / 2

419
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:06,440
and b = 1 /<unk> 5

420
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,440
* 1 -<unk> 5.

421
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,240
So this is pi plus and this is pi minus.

422
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,399
So the formula for

423
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,919
f

424
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,080
well

425
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,919
f of x

426
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,799
=

427
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:56,240
a / y - 5 + x

428
00:31:50,799 --> 00:32:03,039
+ b 1 - 5 - x

429
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:09,120
= a * 1 + 5 + x

430
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:13,240
+ 5 + 2 x 2 + 5 +

431
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,240
cub x cub

432
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and and

433
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:34,640
b * 1 + 5 - x +

434
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:34,640
5 - x^ 2 x^2 + 5 - cub x +

435
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,200
And of course f ofx

436
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,200
was equal to

437
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:54,960
summation x sub i s subn x to the n.

438
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,840
So to find the nth Fibonacci number, we

439
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,840
need to find the nth term in the

440
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,840
sequence.

441
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,799
So we get f subn is equal to

442
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,080
a

443
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,640
y + to the n

444
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,840
+ b

445
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,000
5 minus to the n.

446
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,279
And let's go back and see what a and b

447
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,039
were. a was 1 over<unk> 5 * 5 + and b

448
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:33,679
was 1 over<unk> 5 * 5 minus. So this is

449
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:38,919
equal to 1 /<unk>

450
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,919
5 + n + 1

451
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,720
+ 5 -

452
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,720
n +

453
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,240
where

454
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,240
um

455
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:02,720
5 plus is 1 over<unk> plus 1 +<unk> 5

456
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and 5 - 1 - 5 / 2.

457
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,919
So here we have a term for the nth

458
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,560
Fibonacci number, a formula for the nth

459
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,560
Fibonacci number.

460
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Oh,

461
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,079
okay.

462
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,520
So how fast does the Fibonacci number

463
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,960
grow?

464
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,960
How many me? How many

465
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,960
messages

466
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,440
can we send

467
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:31,000
n time

468
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,000
n with dots and dashes?

469
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,839
Well, it's just this formula.

470
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:53,200
It's 1 /<unk> 5

471
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:57,720
+ n + 1

472
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,720
5 - n + 1.

473
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Okay.

474
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,960
Now

475
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:13,760
I want to say that 5 plus

476
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,920
is bigger than one and 5 minus is less

477
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:21,119
than one. So this is just very

478
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:25,800
approximate very close to 1 / 5

479
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,800
5 + 1.

480
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,640
So the information transmission rate

481
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,000
Right.

482
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,839
Is

483
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,880
log base 2

484
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:50,280
+ n + 1<unk> 5

485
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,280
which is approximately.

486
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:58,440
Well, we want to divide this by the time

487
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,440
per time limit.

488
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:19,040
Let's say information rate per time unit

489
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:23,680
is log 2 + 2 n + 1<unk> 5 / n which is

490
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,079
approximately so this n + one comes

491
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,320
close to canceling this n root five is

492
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,960
just a constant factor a constant

493
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:37,880
addition factor which is negligible. So

494
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,880
it's log 2 of 5x.

495
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,119
So if you have a channel that uses dots

496
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,599
and dashes to transmit information, this

497
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,040
is how much you can transmit in time.

498
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,000
And we're actually going to be going

499
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,280
back to this later in the course and

500
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,119
talking about information theory and how

501
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,320
much information you can transmit in

502
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,960
general. Okay.

503
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,960
So, um,

504
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:20,880
let's see. Trying to think if I have

505
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:24,839
time to do this next um

506
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,839
next bit. I think I do.

507
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,920
So, let's answer another question.

508
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,680
Oh, wait. Before we answer another

509
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:54,480
question, I'm going to go back and say

510
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,560
we actually could have gotten this

511
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,560
formula.

512
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,960
Um,

513
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,960
where is it?

514
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,079
Um,

515
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,160
f ofx

516
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:17,599
equals 1 / 1 - x - x^2

517
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,040
much more easily.

518
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,000
So, how could we have gotten a

519
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,320
generating function for

520
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,280
this dots and dashes problem much more

521
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,280
easily? Anybody?

522
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,240
Okay. So yeah, it's not not completely

523
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,520
obvious.

524
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,119
So f ofx

525
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,000
is

526
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,000
number of sequences

527
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,160
of dot and action.

528
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:02,480
So the generating function

529
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:07,320
A of x = 1

530
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,320
I'm sorry x + x2

531
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,280
for

532
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:18,240
dot dash because dots have time one

533
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,280
which is x dashes have time two which

534
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,520
corresponds to x^2 and we just add them

535
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,320
because you know it's generating

536
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,320
function when you have two disjoint

537
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,480
things you take this sum.

538
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,040
Does the sequence

539
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,560
of

540
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:42,880
dots and dashes is equal to? Well, we

541
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:49,000
use this formula up here 1 / 1 - a x is

542
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,000
1 / 1 - x - x^2.

543
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,359
And we just saved oursel a lot of effort

544
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:59,119
by using that formula rather than

545
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,680
deriving it through,

546
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:06,319
you know, writing out the recurrence and

547
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:10,680
adding the equations up and um

548
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,680
and seeing what the result was.

549
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:22,599
So maybe we should try applying this to

550
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,599
a different question

551
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,800
which

552
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,480
is a tiling question which you're not

553
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,920
getting on your homework.

554
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,079
I think there's a tingling question on

555
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,079
your homework.

556
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,960
The generating function for

557
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,960
number of tilings

558
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,119
of

559
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,119
2 by N strip

560
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,640
with

561
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:19,040
two kinds of tiles.

562
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,599
Uh triangular tile and a

563
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,599
zigzag tile.

564
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,280
>> Say something.

565
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,480
>> Huh?

566
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,480
>> Yeah, you're allowed to rotate a flip.

567
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,040
Otherwise, this would otherwise you

568
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,040
couldn't tile the strip without flipping

569
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:43,640
this one. So, for

570
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,640
three, you get

571
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,079
and

572
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,079
it's

573
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,000
um for

574
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,319
six.

575
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,319
you get,

576
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:15,720
you know, let's let's do five first.

577
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,720
For five, you get um

578
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,359
yeah, that's five. 1 + 2 + 2 and it's

579
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,359
flipped.

580
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,640
And for six, what you can get is you can

581
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,640
get

582
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:55,599
um I'm doing this wrong.

583
00:43:51,119 --> 00:44:00,119
six you can get and now you can

584
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,119
join another unit of six.

585
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,520
Okay.

586
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,960
So how would you find the generating

587
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,960
function for this?

588
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:42,440
Well, let's use this sequence formula.

589
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,440
Um

590
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,200
is equal to well there's two ways of

591
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,640
tiling a

592
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,720
3x two strip. So that's

593
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:01,920
x cub * 2 +

594
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,359
well there are two ways of tiling a five

595
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,920
length five strip. So that's two x to

596
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:12,240
the 5th. There are two ways of tiling a

597
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,800
length seven strip. Um

598
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,520
I mean you just stick two Z tiles in

599
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:25,599
instead of one Z tile. So that's + 2 x7

600
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:29,160
+ x and that is equal to 2 x cubed over

601
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,160
1 - x^2.

602
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:52,400
So

603
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:55,119
g of x is = 1 / 1 - 2x cub over 1 - x^2

604
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,800
is equal to

605
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,359
um

606
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,359
1 over

607
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,000
I would say 1 - x^2

608
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,760
- 2 x cub and I'm going to the one

609
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,760
that's squared on top.

610
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,079
Okay.

611
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,240
Okay. And you can figure out what the

612
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,480
recurrence

613
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,880
for this is,

614
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,839
which is really weird,

615
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,760
but um

616
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,319
maybe I shouldn't say weird, which is

617
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,319
really quite non-intuitive,

618
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:54,760
but

619
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,760
you know, if we had the recurrence

620
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:03,119
um

621
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:06,079
f(n) = fn -1 + fn - 2 that came out to 1

622
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:13,680
- x - x^2.

623
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:16,000
So this is going to be fn is equal to

624
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:22,520
f n

625
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,520
- 2 - 2 fn - 3.

626
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,240
And the top says what the initial

627
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,400
conditions are. Um

628
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,240
f0

629
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:44,760
wait should be a plus. F0

630
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,760
= 1 and f_sub_2 = -1.

631
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,560
And

632
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,280
um I'm not going to have time to explain

633
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,720
why

634
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:09,960
going from here to here makes this, but

635
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,960
let's see what sequence we get.

636
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:28,520
And I should not say this is f_sub_2 =

637
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,520
-3. This is

638
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,599
because I

639
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,800
- x

640
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,760
What was that? 1 - x^2

641
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,640
- 2x cub.

642
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,680
The initial condition

643
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,280
condition is

644
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:08,240
f_sub_2 = 1 f f0

645
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:11,040
= 1 and f sub i = f i - 2 + 2 f - 3

646
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:15,200
and

647
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:20,000
x^2 over 1 - x^2

648
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:22,160
- 2x cubed is the same thing except

649
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,559
The initial condition

650
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:28,800
is f_sub_2 minus one and

651
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:32,720
the same recurrence.

652
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:36,480
So we can look at the recurrence and see

653
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,400
if we actually get what we

654
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,280
wanted.

655
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,359
So,

656
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,680
so one,

657
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:53,040
so this is zero. One, um, two, we get

658
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:55,680
one here. Three, we get one.

659
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:00,240
We get two here.

660
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:02,800
Four, we look back.

661
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,440
Two, and we get

662
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,440
another one.

663
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Um,

664
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:16,079
is that right? Yeah, that's right. And

665
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,559
now we subtract minus one

666
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,040
0 1

667
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:24,240
for five. We look back two and we get

668
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,520
two and we add two *s this. So this

669
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,760
should be four. And now we subtract 1 0

670
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,839
1

671
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,079
0 because subtracting

672
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:40,400
shifting over two and subtracting is the

673
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:44,119
same as multiplying by - x^2

674
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,119
and we get

675
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:49,115
[sighs]

676
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,319
well this should be

677
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,319
two

678
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,599
1 0 1 2

679
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:10,359
and we get 1 0 0 2 0

680
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,359
um two

681
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:19,520
and indeed there were two for five there

682
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:23,359
were two for there was

683
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:27,040
two for three and there's one for length

684
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:30,319
zero which is just the empty tiling

685
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,160
and the next one should give us next

686
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,960
element should really give us four if

687
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,800
I've calculated it right and it probably

688
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:42,559
does I'm not going to

689
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,119
I'm not going to check it.

690
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:49,599
So that is how you could do another

691
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:52,480
tailing. Okay. So now let's switch to

692
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:56,760
a different question.

693
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,760
Let's look at Pascal's triangle.

694
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Okay.

695
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:40,160
Okay. Pascal's triangle is 0 0 1 choose

696
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:43,520
0 1 choose one two choose zero 2 choose

697
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,359
one two choose two

698
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,920
etc.

699
00:52:45,359 --> 00:53:02,000
And let's look it in numbers 1 one 1 2 1

700
00:52:49,920 --> 00:53:04,079
1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 etc.

701
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,920
So let's

702
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:09,839
let's do this now. Suppose you're

703
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,000
just looking at this and you start to

704
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:16,880
sum and you ask what happens if I sum

705
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,599
I guess diagonals of it. I mean, let's

706
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:25,040
take 1 + 1, that's 2.

707
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:28,520
1 + 3 + 1,

708
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,520
that's 5.

709
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:37,680
Um,

710
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:40,400
1 + 6 + 5 + 1,

711
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,920
that's 13.

712
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:48,400
And you happen to notice that these are

713
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,319
um Fibonacci numbers. I mean two is the

714
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,160
third Fibonacci number, five is the

715
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:59,760
fifth Fibonacci number, 13 is the

716
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:01,599
seventh Fibonacci number, etc. Okay, so

717
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,079
once you've noticed this, you can ask

718
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,599
how can I prove it? And actually there

719
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,040
are a whole bunch of ways to prove it.

720
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,400
You can prove it by counting something

721
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,559
two different ways. You can prove it by

722
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,960
straightforward induction and you can

723
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,559
prove it using generating functions. And

724
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,559
I'm going to prove it using generating

725
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,559
functions.

726
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,480
And I have to say I think this this

727
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,319
proof is written up fairly badly in the

728
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,960
notes. It's in the notes.

729
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,960
Okay. So

730
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,839
using

731
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,839
generating functions.

732
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,119
Okay.

733
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,880
Well, first let's

734
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:12,319
compute

735
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:16,920
the generic function

736
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:16,920
for Pascal's triangle.

737
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:27,359
Now, this is a twodimensional array of

738
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,000
numbers. So, we're going to need two

739
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:37,000
variables to do this. And we'll call

740
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
this x to the 0 y 0 x to the 1 y 0

741
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:46,160
um x 0 y 1

742
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:48,400
etc. So what we get is we get x + y

743
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:53,359
choose x

744
00:55:48,400 --> 00:56:01,000
x = 1 0 to infinity from y = 0 to

745
00:55:53,359 --> 00:56:01,000
infinity x + y choose x * x to the

746
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,960
okay

747
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,680
I am

748
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:14,559
not looking at my notes because in my

749
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:17,280
notes I'm sure I did not use x for

750
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:20,839
two different things.

751
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,839
So let's see.

752
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:30,799
Oh

753
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:33,799
yeah. Sum a= 0 to infinity. B= 0 to

754
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,799
infinity.

755
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,400
A + B choose A

756
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,799
X to the A Y to the B.

757
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,880
So this is the generating function for

758
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,799
Pascal's triangle two dimensional

759
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,119
generating functions. So you get two

760
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,119
different variables.

761
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,200
So what is it?

762
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:14,839
A + B to Z to the A

763
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,839
to B.

764
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,680
Okay.

765
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:33,760
So what I want to do is I want to break

766
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:39,359
this up into

767
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:41,119
a = 0 to n

768
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:45,599
and

769
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:48,839
b = n - a

770
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,839
and then

771
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,240
n =

772
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,000
So I'm going to break this up and just

773
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:13,520
sum it along the rows first and then sum

774
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:21,680
all the rows after that. So single row

775
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:21,680
is sum n choose a a 0 to n

776
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:30,240
X to the A Y

777
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,520
to the Mus.

778
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,520
Can someone tell me what this is?

779
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:46,839
>> Yeah.

780
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:46,839
>> Right. This is X Y.

781
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,799
Good.

782
00:58:50,880 --> 00:59:06,520
So from n= 0 to infinity

783
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:06,520
um x + y to the n is = 1 / 1 - x - y

784
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,559
Okay.

785
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,799
Well, what do we do with that?

786
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,400
Well, what we're going to have to do is

787
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:40,839
we're going to have to go back and look

788
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,839
at the sum a little more carefully.

789
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,640
Okay. So

790
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:11,559
here one one one two one 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4

791
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,559
1

792
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,119
Um,

793
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:20,119
let's take

794
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,599
1 5 10

795
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:34,839
5 1 and there's a one over here. So,

796
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,839
let's look at this diagonal.

797
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,280
1

798
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:54,480
6 5

799
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,319
that's 13.

800
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:03,400
Okay.

801
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:03,400
So this turns out to be 3 choose 0 plus

802
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:12,200
3 + 0 choose 0

803
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,200
times

804
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:18,359
x cubed

805
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,359
y 0

806
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,119
plus

807
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,079
2 +

808
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:32,400
2 choose 2

809
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:36,960
x^2 y^ 2 +

810
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:39,920
1 + 4 choose 4.

811
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,920
That's 5 choose 4. That's this

812
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,920
x

813
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,960
y cubed +

814
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:55,839
0 + 6 choose 6

815
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:59,799
x to the 0

816
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,799
y to the

817
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:09,040
um

818
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,040
this is white fourth this is y6

819
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,079
So what we're doing is we're going along

820
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:17,760
and we're

821
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:24,200
you know subtracting one from

822
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:24,200
m and adding two to n each time.

823
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,240
So

824
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,640
I want to say this is

825
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:09,280
summation

826
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:12,280
i = 0 to

827
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,280
um

828
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,880
Okay.

829
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,680
Um,

830
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,119
let's call this F.

831
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:49,400
n - i +

832
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,400
2 i

833
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,160
choose

834
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:58,319
2 i

835
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:00,400
x to the

836
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:04,440
um

837
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,440
2 i y

838
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:11,559
X to the N - I Y 2.

839
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,559
Okay.

840
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,839
So what we want is we want

841
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,319
to somehow

842
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:32,960
group all these terms together in the

843
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:36,359
generating function. Can anybody tell me

844
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,359
how to do that?

845
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,960
Okay.

846
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:06,440
X = Z^2.

847
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,440
and let's let y = z.

848
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:14,240
Okay. So now what we're going to do is

849
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:18,799
this becomes

850
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:23,240
summation i = 0 to n

851
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:23,240
+ i choose 2 i

852
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:35,039
x to the or z 2 n - 2 i * z 2 i and this

853
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,319
is

854
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,319
z to the 2n

855
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:49,119
So if we plug the generating function,

856
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:50,720
if we plug x= z ^2 and y = z into the

857
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,640
generating function for Pascal's

858
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,599
triangle,

859
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:58,400
the generating function we get will give

860
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,839
us these

861
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,960
I guess diagonal sums.

862
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:08,000
Is this clear?

863
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,240
Okay, great. So, what was the generating

864
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,920
function for Pascal? For Pascal's

865
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:17,799
triangle,

866
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,799
um, it was 1 - x - y

867
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,680
Okay.

868
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,680
SO SUBSTITUTE

869
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:11,680
x = what was that? x= z ^2 z^ 2 y + z

870
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:14,400
and 1 / 1 - x - y.

871
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,400
You get

872
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,440
1 /

873
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:23,920
1 - zus

874
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:26,640
1 over z ^2 minus z. And this is a

875
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,640
generating function for the Fibonacci

876
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,640
numbers.

877
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:47,440
And you can go back and you can look at

878
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:50,160
this and you can realize that

879
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,640
our proof not only gives you the

880
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:55,599
Fibonacci numbers for these diagonals,

881
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:59,960
it also

882
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,960
if you look at the other diagonals

883
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:11,160
2 + 1 is three.

884
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,160
And

885
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:21,239
I want to say

886
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:21,239
3 + 4 + 1 is 8.

887
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:30,880
These are I mean these diagonals

888
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:34,080
starting on the left side of the

889
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:37,440
triangle give you the oddnumbered

890
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:40,719
Fibonacci numbers are the every other

891
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:44,400
Fibonacci numbers and these diagonals

892
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:46,319
starting on the right side

893
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:51,159
give you

894
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,159
the Fibonacci numbers between them.

895
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,359
Okay.

896
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:03,199
And that's actually all I wanted to say

897
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:04,799
about generating functions today. We're

898
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:10,480
going to be doing generating functions

899
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:13,040
for Catalan numbers on Tuesday, but I

900
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,440
want to hold that off because

901
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,319
I want to do everything on the same day.

902
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:23,199
So I thought maybe I should show you the

903
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:24,480
proof of the same recurrence with

904
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:27,480
counting something in two different

905
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,480
ways.

906
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,920
So

907
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:54,719
Natur numbers

908
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:57,719
number of length and

909
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,719
sequences

910
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:07,800
of dots and dashes where the dashes are

911
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,800
like two and the dots are like one.

912
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,920
Okay.

913
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,199
Okay. Um,

914
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,960
and

915
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,760
if n equals

916
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,960
5,

917
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,960
a number of sequences

918
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,840
is eight.

919
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,239
So we will be doing that right now. So

920
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,320
let's

921
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:01,320
group

922
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,320
sequences

923
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:08,360
by number of dots.

924
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:27,600
Okay. So, we can have eight dots. Well,

925
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:30,560
we can have zero. We can have one dot,

926
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:35,719
two dashes.

927
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,719
We could have two dots.

928
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:44,480
Um, well, we can't have two dots. We can

929
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:47,040
have three dots and one dash or we could

930
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:50,760
have five dots

931
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,760
and zero dashes.

932
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,840
So, if you have one dot and two dashes,

933
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,840
how many ways are there of ranking these

934
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,840
things?

935
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:12,159
Yeah, it's 1 + 2 choose

936
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:14,719
two.

937
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,480
If you have three dots and one dash, you

938
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:20,480
get

939
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:24,320
3 + 1 choose 1. And if you have five

940
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:27,120
dots and zero dashes, you get 5 + 0

941
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:31,800
choose zero.

942
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,800
And I want to claim that this is

943
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:37,960
essentially this sum. So summation

944
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,880
um

945
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:52,960
let's say a

946
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:54,480
n + i i= 0 2

947
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,480
something

948
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,480
choose

949
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:15,679
This is three. This is

950
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:22,520
3 + 1 + 1 is 4. And this is 1. And that

951
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:22,520
corresponds to this diagonal 3 + 4 + 1.

952
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:31,040
So this is a way of proving

953
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,440
this

954
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:37,199
formula by counting things in two

955
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:39,120
different ways. You count the number of

956
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:42,080
sequences of dots and dashes of length

957
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,880
n. And first you do it by just saying

958
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,280
that's a Fibonacci number. And the

959
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,800
second way you do it

960
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:54,800
is by grouping them by the number of

961
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:56,480
dots and dashes in each one. And

962
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,239
twice the number of dots plus the number

963
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:03,840
of dashes is equal to the length of the

964
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:07,480
sequence. And summing them up gives you

965
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,480
these diagonals.

966
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:18,719
Okay. Any questions about this?

967
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:22,621
Can you explain what's the last step?

968
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,621
The last thing you said? [snorts]

969
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,920
>> Yeah, I'm connecting it with Pascal's

970
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:32,199
triangle. Um,

971
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,199
actually, I probably should have

972
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,960
Okay, I have a formula in here, I

973
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,960
believe.

974
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,159
Okay.

975
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,920
So

976
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:40,800
summation

977
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:40,800
m + j choose 2 j j

978
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,480
claim.

979
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:02,920
This

980
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:02,920
is the number of ways

981
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,159
of

982
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,159
arranging

983
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,239
dots and dashes

984
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,000
to have

985
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,320
um

986
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,320
let's see.

987
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,640
So

988
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:41,480
I want to call this as Mus J

989
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,480
plus 2 J 2 J

990
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:47,960
and we have length F.

991
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:07,400
If we have

992
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,400
M minus J dashes

993
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:14,600
2 J dots

994
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,600
you get like them.

995
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:24,320
Yeah. I mean the dots are length one,

996
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:27,320
the dashes are length two. So this is

997
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,320
length

998
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,280
and um

999
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,120
number of ways

1000
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,400
to arrange

1001
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,520
uh

1002
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,520
minus J box options

1003
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,600
2 J dots

1004
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:05,400
is

1005
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:05,400
m - j + 2 j choose 2 j

1006
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:12,520
which is

1007
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:12,520
m + j choose 2 j.

1008
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:21,600
uh sum

1009
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:25,920
m + j choose 2 j.

1010
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:29,640
There's a number of ways of breaking 2 m

1011
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,640
length 2 m

1012
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,760
of arranging dots and dashes to have

1013
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:39,880
length 2 m total. So this is equal to FI

1014
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,880
number of like 2m

1015
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,760
maybe plus or minus I mean or maybe this

1016
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:51,320
is 2 m + 1 or minus one or something but

1017
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,320
anyway this gives you the formula

1018
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:23,760
Okay. So next time we're going to derive

1019
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:25,760
the formula for the Cadillac number

1020
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,520
which

1021
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:31,120
I can't remember if I told you what it

1022
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:33,920
was already or not. I think I did

1023
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:36,320
using in fact we derived it using Dick

1024
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,320
Walts. I'm next time we will derive it

1025
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:41,120
using generating functions and a

1026
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:45,280
recurrence for the cataly.

1027
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:47,120
And that will I think finish our um

1028
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,600
section on generating functions and I

1029
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,600
think
