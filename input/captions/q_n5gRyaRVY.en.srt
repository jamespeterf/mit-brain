00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:09,360
to demonstrate this next idea I have

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:11,719
traveled back in time to 1930 and met my

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
grandfather grandfather has not yet had

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,880
any children what would happen if he

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,599
experiment I have with me a fully loaded

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,640
gun what will happen will I succeed in

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
have any children

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,800

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,680
born so I will never be born can I cause

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,320
myself to never be born if I don't

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,280
succeed what stops me am I somehow not
