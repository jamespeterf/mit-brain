1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,920
Awesome. Thank you all uh and thanks for

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,919
the introduction. So I'm really uh

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,679
excited to be able to talk to you all

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,000
about some of the work that's happening

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,559
in my group uh in visualization at

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,080
CESAL. And this is uh work that that a

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,880
lot of different folks in my group have

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,439
contributed to over the years um as well

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,680
as a project that the CIRC seed grant

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,320
helped support. So I want to start by

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,439
sort of casting our minds back to the

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
pandemic era, right? Um we might

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,440
remember being inundated with

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
visualizations, right? The flatten the

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,440
curve chart went viral. Ironically, not

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,760
actually a visualization. It was not

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
showing any data, but nevertheless, uh,

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,559
you know, really bolstered a bunch of

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
change at a societal level we'd never

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
seen before. I think many of us were

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039
sort of frantically checking these kinds

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,680
of dashboards, right? the John's Hopkins

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,680
one or uh you know our local state

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,680
government websites and then the front

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,680
pages of most major news publications

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,159
were plastered with sort of wall-to-wall

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,320
coverage of charts uh tracking a variety

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
of different metrics from you know case

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,799
rates to death rates to vaccination

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,640
rates when we had those um and these

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,119
visualizations became such a part of the

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,759
mainstream that they were even me right

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,920
so here obviously is the reason that

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
some countries did better with the

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,280
pandemic than others, right? Like how

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,360
much bubble tea were we drinking as a

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,240
society? And so as a result of sort of

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
this outpouring of visualizations, you

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,200
know, lots of folks thought that this

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
was data visualizations breakthrough

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,680
moment, right? Uh the folks who were

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
producing some of these charts um you

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
know, were interviewed in in

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,119
high-profile publications like here is

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
John Burns Murdoch um an incredible

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,439
graphics editor at the Financial Times.

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
Um, you might remember, you know, these

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,799
charts with an orange background that I

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,040
feel like were at least everywhere on my

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,079
social media feed. Uh, but sort of in

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,840
parallel to this glowing coverage was,

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
uh, you know, a set of experiences that

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,040
people were having that is really well

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,240
encapsulated by this tweet from Chanse

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,520
Fleet who is a, uh, blind technologist,

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,680
uh, and researcher um, uh, who works at

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
the New York Public Library. So Chansy

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,239
writes that today she uh you know read

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,560
the alternative text for a chart on a

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,640
local news site. Um and that all text

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
suggested that in New York City the

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
COVID case count had been steadily

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,360
declining since April 20 uh the April

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,120
26th. Um and that that trend was

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,360
continuing. And she thought well that

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
can't be right. Um and so what Chanse

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,239
did was emboss the graphic and confirmed

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,480
that actually you know the alt text was

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,200
wrong. And the reason that the alt text

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
was wrong was you know in this case um

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
the person who had written the article

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,920
had just sort of copied and pasted some

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,319
boilerplate uh text to describe the

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,160
chart um not necessarily double-checking

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,319
the facts. Um and and Chanse was not

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,040
necessarily alone in this experience,

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,800
right? Uh there are by by some estimates

78
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,560
from from the National Federation for

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,040
the Blind and and this is pretty dated.

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,280
This is from 2016. There are about seven

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,159
million people in the United States. So

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,720
about 2% of our population that has some

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,560
form of visual disability. And and

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,680
according to these estimates at least,

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,560
visual disabilities refer to folks who

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,959
either experience total vision loss or

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,200
some pretty serious form of vision loss

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,840
such that even wearing glasses or

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,360
contact lenses, you know, doesn't fully

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,040
correct them to 2020 vision. Um, and

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,360
this is also a good moment to just sort

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,280
of like pause and and think about, you

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
know, how we actually think about

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,159
disability more generally. So, typically

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
scholars think uh, you know, there are

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,239
essentially two models of disability.

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,159
The first is what what people refer to

98
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,480
as the medical model of disability. The

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,840
idea that, you know, being disabled

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,440
suggests that there's something wrong

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,319
with your mind or your body. Um and and

102
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,640
the critique of this approach is that it

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,480
often focuses on designing technologies

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,319
and interventions that are focused at

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
the level of the individual person,

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,560
right? Where often the goal is kind of

107
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,080
implicitly to fix the thing that is

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,319
wrong with um the person's body. And I

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,720
you know I really like this description

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,600
of what those sorts of technological

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,479
interventions uh produce. So Liz Jackson

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,000
is an disability rights activist and she

113
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,440
calls these sort of interventions

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,280
disability dongles, right? Um I don't

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,360
necessarily have a very positive

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
affinity with my dongles. I think all of

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
us who have Macs, uh you know, probably

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,160
have a whole tray of different dongles

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,199
that we have to kind of juggle, right?

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,600
Um it's a well-intended, um elegant

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,919
even, yet nevertheless useless solution

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,880
to a problem that disabled people never

123
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,280
even knew that they had. And so in

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,560
contrast to the medical model um you

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
know there's a social model of

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,960
disability that considers people to be

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,120
rendered disabled because of choices um

128
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,120
and decisions that society has made. In

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
essence, you know, people who with

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
disabilities are not having their needs

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
met. And so this this approach

132
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
recognizes that essentially all

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,039
technology is assistive in some way,

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
right? So, I particularly like this

135
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,759
chart from uh Microsoft's inclusive

136
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,919
design toolkit because it not only sort

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,000
of surveys all the different senses

138
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,320
along which um you know someone might be

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,120
disabled but notes that disability

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,960
doesn't have to be a permanent sort of

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,360
uh state, right? It can be temporary or

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,759
even situational as in the case of a new

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,400
parent or a distracted driver. And so,

144
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
as a result, the social model tries to

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
make interventions at the level of

146
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,080
infrastructure rather than the

147
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,720
individual. Right? So what do I mean by

148
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,639
infrastructure? Well, a very commonly

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
used piece of infrastructure

150
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
particularly by people who are blind or

151
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,320
have low vision is something called a

152
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,080
screen reader. So screen readers are

153
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,199
built into most modern operating

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,759
systems. It's on Mac OS, iOS, um most

155
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
modern browsers even have uh plugins for

156
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,280
them. And essentially like the name

157
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,680
suggests a screen reader narrates

158
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,919
oncreen content. So I want to show you a

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,840
quick demo um from my postoc Jonathan

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,440
Zong who's been leading uh all of this

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,160
work in my group for a few years about

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,080
how a screen reader works. A screen

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,199
reader is an assisted technology that

164
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,960
narrates oncreen elements as speech. The

165
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,880
software provides a cursor which is

166
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
shown visually on the screen as a black

167
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,800
rectangle and a user can use keyboard

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,479
shortcuts to move that cursor and

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,319
highlight different elements to be read

170
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,800
out. I'll demonstrate that with my

171
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
keyboard now. Visited link heading level

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639

for accessible data visualization.

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,800
So you'll notice that the narration was

179
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
actually pretty fast, right? Um but what

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,639
I what what Jonathan did there was

181
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,800
actually slow the speed of the narration

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,039
way way down because we imagine that

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,599
most folks in this room aren't um you

184
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,680
know used to to uh uh this kind of

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,759

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,479
screen meter users have that speed, you

187
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,759
know, sped all the way up. Um, and so

188
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,840
what does it look like when a screen

189
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,720
meter user experiences a visualization?

190
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,400
Let's take a look.

74,223,755 votes, 46.9%.

214
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,639
So notice that, you know, it read out

215
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,039
that whole string of essentially

216
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,719
nonsense, right? Um but the person who

217
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,560
made this video, Sarah Fosheim, she

218
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
wasn't actually tabbing around, right?

219
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,800
Her cursor was actually on the same node

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,839
for that entire, you know, minute and a

221
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,480
half long video. Um and here, you know,

222
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,480
this is actually a pretty good

223
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,959
experience if you can imagine that. Here

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,519
is often what happens with most

225
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,839
visualizations.

226
00:08:50,519 --> 00:09:01,959
Image image image

227
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:06,720
image image one face image logo other

228
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,480
image image logo other image. And so we

229
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,399
kind of get the point, right? But I

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,000
often like to let these videos play

231
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,959
through because I want us to have a

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,640
really visceral experience of how

233
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,279
frustrating

234
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,279
the experience of using the internet

235
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,200
with a screen reader can be for folks,

236
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,959
right? I think for us it's kind of

237
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,440
amusing because this is just a cute one

238
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,040
minute video and a talk, but imagine if

239
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,880
the internet was a series of images just

240
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,920
being narrated out to you like this,

241
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,279
right? incredibly incredibly not just

242
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,160
frustrating, but you're locked out of a

243
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,480
pretty key information modality, right?

244
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,040
How many of us were making decisions

245
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,959
about whether we should go out or not in

246
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,120
the pandemic and you would be locked out

247
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,399
of that modality entirely and just hear

248
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,839
image image image. And so the challenge

249
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,320
with uh you know uh v uh representing

250
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,080
visualizations in this way is that as

251
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,200
you're noticing right the pattern of of

252
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,760
reading things out has to be linearized

253
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
for a visualization but all of us

254
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,200
probably read visualizations in lots of

255
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,279
different ways. Some of us might look at

256
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,920
the title first maybe look at some other

257
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,399
textual annotations. Others of us might

258
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,720
look at the trend that um uh the

259
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,360
visualization is is trying to convey.

260
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,920
And so part of the challenge uh with

261
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,480
with visualizations currently is that

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,959
the current best practices don't

263
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,640
represent that diversity very well. Um

264
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
at most, you know, you might get a piece

265
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,800
of alternative text like this that tries

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,680
to summarize the chart um and then gives

267
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,000
you a link to a data table uh for

268
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,920
further sort of analysis. And when we

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
talked to to blind people about this,

270
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,120
you know, they they talked about how

271
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,839
they felt like they were at the mercy of

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
the all text writers who made

273
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,760
assumptions about what sorts of intra uh

274
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
data they would be interested in. You

275
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,680
know, another person said that I would

276
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
like to have time and space to interpret

277
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,480
the numbers for themselves. Right? Blind

278
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,839
people want a sense of agency um and to

279
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,839
feel like they're in control of their

280
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,839
experiences. On the other hand, you

281
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,600
know, I'm sure none of us would want to

282
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,360
actually page through a whole data table

283
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,160
to understand who won the election,

284
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,880
right? There's 393 rows. I would never

285
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,760
scroll through all of it. Um, and

286
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,200
because everything is being read out

287
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,519
linearly, you have to sort of hold all

288
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,079
of this information in your head to have

289
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,800
any sort of ability to to sort of make

290
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,200
some insightful observation. And so

291
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
instead of this very linear structure,

292
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,560
my students and I, you know, have been

293
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,320
thinking about a much more hierarchical

294
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,800
textoriented way of depicting uh

295
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
visualiza, you know, visualized data um

296
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,200
to screen readers. And the way to think

297
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,279
about this hierarchy is at the the sort

298
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
of topmost level, you get some sort of

299
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,120
summary of the chart, right? So a

300
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
scatter plot with some data along the

301
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,279
x-axis, some other data along the y-

302
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,120
axis. And then with the down arrow key,

303
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,200
you can essentially descend into

304
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,600
different levels of these hierarchies

305
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,240
based on visual properties like the

306
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,639
x-axis, the y-axis, so on and so forth.

307
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,600
And you can keep drilling down into this

308
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,519
chart again, continuing to make use of

309
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
visual affordances like the major axis

310
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,320
ticks, the minor access ticks, and so on

311
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,279
and so forth. So let's take a a look at

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,800
an example of what this looks like.

313
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,040
Let's say I'm using a screen reader and

314
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,600
I encounter the scatter plot on a page

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,839
with Ali. At first I'll hear an overall

316
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
description of what the scatter plot is.

317
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
A scatter plot with axi slipper length

318
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
mm and body mass g. Let's say I want

319
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
more detail about the scatter plot. So I

320
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,560
can press the down arrow key and expand

321
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,000
this structure to the next level where I

322
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,959
can get information about the different

323
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,399
axes and legends of the chart. X-axis

324
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,399
titled flipper length. mm for a

325
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,320
quantitative scale with values from 172

326
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,360
to 231. And once I'm on this level, I

327
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,440
can press the left and right arrow keys

328
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,000
to cycle through the other elements on

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,959
this level. Y-axis titled body mass G

330
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
for legend titled species for let's say

331
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,560
that I'm interested in getting more

332
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,200
detail about the X-axis. So I can

333
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,040
navigate back over to the X-axis with

334
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,680
the left arrow key and then press down

335
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,480
again to descend into a further level of

336
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,720
detail. Yaxis titled Xaxis. and down

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,440
arrow to expand. One of seven flipper

338
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,959
length mm is between 172 and 180. Seven

339
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
values. Press t to open table. And on

340
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,760
this level I get information about the

341
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,000
intervals along each axis. Two of seven

342
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,839
flipper length mm is between 180 and

343
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
190. Three of seven. Flip four of seven.

344
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,279
Five of seven. Six of seven. Seven of

345
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,880
seven. I'm going to demonstrate here an

346
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,639
alternate navigation technique that

347
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,600
we're calling spatial navigation. So I'm

348
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,000
going to use the WD keys to move along

349
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,320
the grid of the scatter plot. Five data

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,680
values in the interval body mass g 2500

351
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,880
300 flipper length mm

352
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,800
180,190 60 data values in the interval

353
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,240
body mass g 79 data values in the in 10

354
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
data values in the interval 25 data

355
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,519
values in the in 32 data values in zero

356
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,959
data three data values in the 23 data

357
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,320
values in the interval body map 30 data

358
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,800
values in the inter body so here by

359
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,720
moving around the grid I'm able to build

360
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,519
more of a mental picture of how the data

361
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,959
values are distributed spatially and so

362
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
you can see you know we've taken that

363
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,959
idea of alternative text and made it a

364
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,959
much more sort of dynamic experience

365
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,880
Right? Folks can drill down into

366
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,880
different levels of detail. They can

367
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,399
move around a scatter plot almost like

368
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
they would with their fingers on sort of

369
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,079
a tactile graphic. But one of the things

370
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
you might notice is all the textual

371
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,440
descriptions right now, they're kind of

372
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,199
bog standard, right? There's not a lot

373
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,199
of richness or or particularly

374
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,360
insightful things. And you couldn't

375
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,440
expect any human visualization designer

376
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
to sit there and enumerate, you know,

377
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,000
every sort of interesting thing in this

378
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,600
huge sort of space. So this is sort of

379
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,480
almost a perfect opportunity to

380
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,079
intervene with some generative AI to

381
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,920
think about, you know, what richer

382
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,160
textual descriptions of visualizations

383
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,480
might look like. So here I'll I'll turn

384
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,800
things over to Isabella Padraza Pieros

385
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,839
who's been exploring this um work as

386
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,440
part of her master's

387
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,600
thesis. In this version of Ali, we've

388
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,199
added something called data highlights.

389
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,959
And if I navigate into the data

390
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,120
highlights by pressing the down arrow

391
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,199
key, it's going to show us semantically

392
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,040
meaningful groupings of data that we've

393
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,399
generated through calls to chat.

394
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,000
GPT data highlights for highlights. One

395
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,279
of four efficient foragers. This group

396
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
combines midsized flipper lengths with a

397
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,760
healthy body mass, indicating penguins

398
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,040
that have adapted well to a range of

399
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,320
environments, being able to swiftly

400
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,760
navigate open waters while also capable

401
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,680
of agility. A combination suited for

402
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,160
efficient foraging. Flipper length mm is

403
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,519
between 191 and 210 in body mass G is

404
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,079
between 3,3001 and 4385 values. Press T

405
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,000
to open table. Select. So in that

406
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,240
description, we heard about a grouping

407
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,079
called efficient foragers. And the

408
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,760
system provided some reasoning about how

409
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,920
certain values of flipper length and

410
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,480
body mass might indicate that certain

411
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,800
penguins are part of this group. And if

412
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
you look over at the

413
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,160
visualization, you can actually see the

414
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,720
visual representation of this efficient

415
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,639
foragers grouping that we've highlighted

416
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,360
to draw an analyst's attention to this

417
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,680
grouping of data. We can also explore to

418
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
find more about other data highlights.

419
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
Two of four, three of four. Antarctic

420
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,920
marathoners. Long flipper lengths paired

421
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
with a robust or athletic body mass may

422
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,240
indicate penguins that are specialized

423
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
for endurance swimming in Antarctic

424
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,880
conditions capable of long-distance

425
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,440
hunting in open waters. Flipper length

426
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,880
mm is between 211 and 235 and body mass

427
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,360
G is between 43001 and 6,400 96 values.

428
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,680
Press T to open table.

429
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I mean I love the the titles that you

430
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,720
know Chachi PT is giving to these

431
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,519
different kinds of penguins, right?

432
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,320
Antarctic marathoners. Um and turns out

433
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,240
so did uh user you know participants in

434
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,079
our user studies. So, you know, one

435
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,759
person said that they really appreciated

436
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,519
being able to drill up and down these

437
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
different layers in the grid because it

438
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,279
gave them a really different way of

439
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,199
thinking about, you know, data and

440
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,279
visualization. Some of our participants,

441
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,639
you know, all of whom were blind. Um,

442
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,240
some of them said that, you know, with

443
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,079
our system, this was the first time they

444
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,079
actually understood what a scatter plot

445
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,600
was showing. Um, you know, they never

446
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,279
really understood what a scatter plot

447
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,959
was. And that was kind of a really

448
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,320
special moment. Um, you know, another

449
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,959
person told us that they were able to

450
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,959
think much more in spatial terms, right?

451
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,120
Um, I'm moving up and through the grid.

452
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,680
I'm I'm drilling down just to that

453
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,720
square to get some particular

454
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,720
information. Um, you know, another

455
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,480
person mentioned how things like the

456
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,319
data highlights gave, you know, it

457
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
boosted their sense of confidence,

458
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,360
right? Their their ability to actually

459
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,280
think in terms of the data. Um, and a

460
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,959
final person, you know, said that it

461
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,480
made them even much more interested in

462
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,880
exploring the data. that open their

463
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,880
minds to particular kinds of insights or

464
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,919
trends that could be unlocked through

465
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,240
the data. Um, and so we've released uh

466
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,799
this toolkit um you know as an open

467
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,280
source project uh called Ali. Um these

468
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,280
LLM extensions will be coming soon. Uh

469
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,790
and with that I'm I'm very happy to take

470
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,640
all your questions. Thanks very much.

471
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:48,919
[Applause]

472
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,919
Thank you very much. Servin questions.

473
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,400
Hi, thank you so much for this talk.

474
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,360
Absolutely. Um I was wondering uh

475
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,480
because these uh large language models

476
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,919
are prone to for example

477
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,720
hallucinations where they uh create

478
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,679
false data or maybe describe things in a

479
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,559
way that is not intended. if there was

480
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,280
any sort of metrics or ways in which you

481
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,440
decided to go about that or to combat

482
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
against that. Yeah, absolutely. So, one

483
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,640
of the ways that you know we produce

484
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,400
those statements uh with chatgpt is we

485
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
give it the context of the data that

486
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,640
it's looking at. Um so we're not we're

487
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,039
not sort of you know prompting it with

488
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,760
with no guidance whatsoever. Uh the fact

489
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,480
that you know we provide that data often

490
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,000
kind of constrains its generation. Yeah.

491
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
That's not to say, you know, there's no

492
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,160
chance of it hallucinating. Um, but at

493
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,120
least that that captures sort of a broad

494
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,120
bucket of them. Yeah.

495
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,600
Okay. Further questions.

496
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,640
Oh, right here.

497
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,840
Um, thank you so much for your talk. I

498
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,799
was also just wondering expanding on

499
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,480
like metrics for accuracy. Are you doing

500
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:14,760
any validation to assess how accurate

501
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,720
the model is or like um prevent any

502
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,360
hallucinations from happening? Yeah,

503
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,520
absolutely. So, um we haven't yet, but

504
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,679
it's certainly something on our uh on

505
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,320
our agenda. And so right now, one of the

506
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,280
things we're sort of curious about is,

507
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,080
you know, when do like how should the

508
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,160
text be worded to prompt the user to

509
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,480
actually consider verifying or

510
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,559
validating? Um, so are there different

511
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,640
ways that that a particular description

512
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,120
could be worded to, you know, encourage

513
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,120
someone to verify or validate it? Um,

514
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,200
when, you know, do they want that sort

515
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,960
of verification, validation, um, things

516
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,960
like that. Yeah. Thank you.

517
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:07,520
Um just thinking uh one can imagine

518
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,160
giving the user the ability to instruct

519
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,840
um with verbal instructions that are

520
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,520
somewhat flexible. Have you considered

521
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,600
that as well? Yeah. So, that's a really

522
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
great question because um you know, one

523
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,880
of the interesting things about

524
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,039
visualization is often we use it to ask

525
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,200
questions we don't even know we have,

526
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,520
right? Um and so a lot of the use of

527
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,679
visualization is often more for

528
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,679
discovery and sort of serendipity and

529
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,960
and things like that where you almost

530
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,480
don't know what it is you're looking

531
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,720
for. So, you wouldn't know how to sort

532
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
of formulate the question. Um, and so

533
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,760
that's why we focused on these sorts of

534
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,000
of use cases where we're trying to use

535
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,080
generative AI to sort of, you know,

536
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
accelerate that that knowledge discovery

537
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,600
process. You could certainly imagine,

538
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,840
you know, augmenting this interface

539
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,480
with, you know, some sort of Q&A panel

540
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,559
or something like that. Certainly. Yeah.

541
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,280
I was wondering what's the main

542
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,120
demographic that's testing

543
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,120
uh because I feel like that would affect

544
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,039
the way they perceive things. Yeah.

545
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,720
Yeah. So, the main demographic we we've

546
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,880
been testing with are are sort of

547
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,120
full-time screen meter users. Um, so

548
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,799
they're folks who, you know, use screen

549
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
meters day in and day out because they

550
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,840
have some form of fairly serious visual

551
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,880
disability. Um, most of our folks were

552
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,720
were fully blind. Um, but some fair

553
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,840
portion of them have some kind of low

554
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
vision. So, they use, you know, screen

555
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:31,559
magnification alongside a screen reader

556
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,559
or things like that. Yeah.

557
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,200
kind of coming off of that question,

558
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,120
um did you look at like like their maybe

559
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
like their the various the people's like

560
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,960
education levels and ability to

561
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,240
interpret like just since it's about

562
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,080
interpreting data like are they I feel

563
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,400
like that has a lot to do that can vary.

564
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,280
Absolutely. So we we had a pretty

565
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,760
diverse range of sort of familiarity and

566
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,440
experience with data. um we had a you

567
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,000
know a handful of folks who do

568
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,799
professional data work um as well as you

569
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,039
know folks who don't use it at all um

570
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,120
and so I think those final two quotes

571
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,960
were from folks who had you know much

572
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,120
more minimal experience and familiarity

573
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,280
with data um so that's why you know it

574
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,280
gave them a a boost in confidence it

575
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,840
increased their interest in engaging

576
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,919
with data because they're the set of

577
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,159
folks who would not be sort of thrilled

578
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,480
to just have a link to you know the raw

579
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,200
CSV and and sort of like move through

580
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,360
the table, right? Um, but on on the flip

581
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,919
side, they also aren't satisfied just

582
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,840
being told like here's the alt text,

583
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,000
like here's what the the summary of the

584
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,520
chart is, right? So, it's it's trying to

585
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,120
meet those people where they are in

586
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,120
terms of their data needs as well. Yeah.
