00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
So today we're going to do a simple

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,359
little demonstration we're just going to

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,760
work out how big a voltage we can get on

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,360
this vandag graph generator when I have

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,960
the belt on the belt is pulling

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,160
electrons out of the vandag graph and

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,880
when I have the grounding rod here as it

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
pulls electrons out of the Vander graph

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,400
the electrons are flowing back in

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,199
through the grounding rod now as soon as

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,680
I take the grounding rod

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,640
off the only way that the electrons can

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,800
get from the grounding rod to the vandag

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,119
graph is via making a lightning bolt and

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,800
right there there's a lightning bolt

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,840
that's going about 15 cm through dry air

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,079
and the breakdown voltage of dry air is

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,960
33,000 volts per centimeter so that's

19
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,800
roughly 500,000 volts if I come in

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,199
closer they'll become much more frequent

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,920
because the vandag graph discharges when

22
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,280
it's picked up a much lower voltage

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,680
right now it's discharging when it's

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,039
only about 100,000 Volts for more MIT

25
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,719
