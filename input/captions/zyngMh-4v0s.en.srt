1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,418
I'm from a city called

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,253
Valencia in eastern Spain,

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:04,921
in the Mediterranean.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,173
So very nice weather, very nice food.

5
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:08,633
I come from a family

6
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,926
where there's no scientists.

7
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:10,969
My parents didn't go

8
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:11,720
to college or anything.

9
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:12,804
So I'm first generation.

10
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,723
And, you know, my

11
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,099
parents, they read a lot.

12
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,642
So they were well-educated people

13
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,227
despite not having gone to college.

14
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,980
I was always very naturally curious.

15
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,898
I was always asked, and

16
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,191
why, and why, and why.

17
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,402
And I also kind of remember

18
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,862
my parents in the car rides,

19
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,696
getting a little bit

20
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,198
annoyed by my constant asking,

21
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,658
why is this, why is that?

22
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,409
You know, why is the

23
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,535
moon following us, you know,

24
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,244
when we're in the car?

25
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,960
It turns out that I like science.

26
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:44,961
And I started to take

27
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,296
college classes in physics

28
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,338
when I was in high school.

29
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:48,715
And I liked it.

30
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,966
Ended up at the University of Valencia

31
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,801
where I studied physics in my hometown.

32
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,263
I was going to do my PhD in the

33
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,014
University of Valencia

34
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,433
because that's what 99% of my friends

35
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,227
did, but then one of my teachers,

36
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,854
one of my college professors told me,

37
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,773
you know, you're doing quite well.

38
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,065
I think you would be

39
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,192
able to do better research

40
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,611
abroad than in Spain.

41
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,573
The most exciting physics was

42
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,617
going on in the US at the time.

43
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,869
And UCSD was one of the

44
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,537
places where this was quite good.

45
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,414
I intended to do my PhD in

46
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,624
theoretical particle physics,

47
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,417
but there I got

48
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,835
exposed to all of physics,

49
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,836
very high quality research

50
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,921
in all fields of physics.

51
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,298
So I slowly and gradually

52
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,175
became more and more interested

53
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,468
in other areas of physics.

54
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,346
At the ultimate level, it is physics

55
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,640
just responsible for everything that

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,557
happens in the universe

57
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,850
and that explains it.

58
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,727
That power of using

59
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,437
math and a few concepts

60
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,940
to kind of explain everything,

61
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,733
that is super

62
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,984
appealing to me intellectually.

63
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,572
I had heard about MIT obviously before,

64
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,866
but by the end of my PhD and postdoc,

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,118
I knew what MIT really meant.

66
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,329
First week or two that I was at MIT,

67
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,623
they have this thing for faculty called

68
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,416
their random faculty dinners.

69
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,086
And I had next to me on one

70
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,712
side sitting Wolfgang Ketterle,

71
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,964
who's Nobel Prize in physics.

72
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,132
And on the other side, Peter Schor,

73
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,927
who has gotten about every prize,

74
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,845
but is the inventor of the

75
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,846
field of quantum computing.

76
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,389
And I remember thinking,

77
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,348
well, if this is what happens

78
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,058
when you sit randomly, you know,

79
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,561
between two faculty at MIT, where am I?

80
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:25,895
I almost feel a little bit

81
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,063
awkward or selfish saying,

82
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,190
but it's largely having fun, you know.

83
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,278
It is really the people

84
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,821
that make this place great.

85
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,614
It feels very different

86
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,199
intellectually from other places.

87
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,200
Many of my colleagues,

88
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,952
despite who they are,

89
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,537
they're actually very humble, you know.

90
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,163
Most people are very open-minded.

91
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,958
They're happy to learn from others.

92
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,751
They are intellectually curious.

93
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,212
Being part of a big community

94
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,755
that is doing interesting research

95
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,799
and advancing the frontiers of knowledge,

96
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,467
that's something that's also very

97
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,969
stimulating and rewarding.
