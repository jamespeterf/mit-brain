00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,240
The National Football League is the most

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,640
profitable important football

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,200
organization in America. Football's the

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,120
most profitable sport in the country.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,920
Advertising is incredibly valuable in

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,839
football games. Now, the NFL is 32

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,760
teams, essentially 32 businesses

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,840
competing in a literal sense with each

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,119
other. And there's a huge incentive to

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,439
collude. What the NFL does is they only

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,439
sell the TV rights for the league, which

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
causes a cartel. They're saying, "If you

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,080
want to broadcast football, you got to

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,200
come to us and we're going to charge a

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,719
super high price." In 1957, the Supreme

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Court ruled that this was

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,760
anti-competitive. And they couldn't do

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,399
it. And the NFL will make $40 billion

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,960
this year off their collusive cartel.

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
Why? Because Congress stepped in and

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
said, "Well, we're going to actually

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
exempt football from our nation's

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,960
antitrust laws."
