00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,799
from the MIT energy initiative this is

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,400
what if it works a podcast looking at

4
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:11,800
the energy solutions for climate change

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,920
Stoner on today's show a glimpse into

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,000
the future the future of nuclear energy

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,439
of course nuclear power plants have been

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,240
with us for a long time and they produce

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,200
a lot of energy but traditional nuclear

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,640
energy comes from fision and for some

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,079
scientists an enormous source of

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,120
excitement is Fusion a type of nuclear

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,320
energy that could change our lives how

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,920
well think about it this way there are

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,559
only two inexhaustible sources of

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,800
effectively inexhaustible sources of

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,600
energy on Earth it's the heat content of

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,079
the earth which is what we call

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,719
geothermal okay and it's Fusion it's

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,199
fusing together the the things which are

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,000
in water the heavy forms of hydrogen

23
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,440
that's Dennis white a professor in the

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,880
department of nuclear science and

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,240
engineering at MIT and he's the former

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,759
director of the MIT plasma science and

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,960
fusion Center he says unlocking either

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,080
the heat content of the Earth or

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,400
unlocking Fusion would be totally

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,320
gamechanging and not just

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,200
scientifically access to energy is the

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,320
most Geo important geopolitical aspect

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,840
of of leadership right now in the world

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,079
and in fact it's also the greatest

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,399
source of conflict as we also see around

36
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,159
on those things and both of those have

37
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,399
interesting aspects to them that namely

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,399
that's the science truth of them and

39
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,200
then the reality of them as practical

40
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,119
energy sources is that they're both

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,759
technology driven where we we the United

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,640
States have an obvious Advantage about

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,360
being able to do that because we

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,119
won more or less all of the major

45
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,960
technical races of the last 50 years we

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,960
could win these ones as well too and I

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,560
think that would be really important not

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,079
just to the United States but to the

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
world but why should the government and

50
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,280
companies and institutions spend money

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,680
on Fusion if the fusion still in

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,280
development especially since solar

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,560
panels and windmills are out there in

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,280
the world working so the first answer is

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,599
math we are using exactly the same

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,879
percentage of our energy sources in the

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,080
world come from carbon based fuels as

58
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,959
they did 10 years ago as they did 50

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,400
years ago and so that's the math of it

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,720
so people are confused by this people

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,959
see wind farms they see solar farms and

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,400
they go well we must be getting greener

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,720
at sources of energy right worldwide we

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,840
are not why not white says the answer is

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,480
kind of stunning I have a chart which

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,480
basically shows the Energy Mix has

67
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,560
barely moved my plug was like to 1970 so

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,280
like 50 years ago that's good cuz you

69
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
know we can kind of realize this within

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,080
our lifetimes it's like it hasn't moved

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,799
oh but the world worldwide energy

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,159
production has almost

73
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,319
tripled so if you were to poll most

74
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,959
people like yourself you just go are we

75
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,959
emitting less or more carbon now into

76
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,560
the atmosphere than we were 50 years ago

77
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,159
every oh we think of our big gas guzzler

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,920
cars you know the ones that our dads

79
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,120
drove the big kers you know D D D and

80
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,080
all the smoke coming out oh we're way

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,040
less it's triple what it was 50 years

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,480
ago not only are there more people on

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,439
the planet than there were 50 years ago

84
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,200
but more of those people are living

85
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:38,120
energy hungry lives in general I think

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,920
we are not say we are not deluding

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,319
ourselves but we're feeling better about

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,920
ourselves by deploying things like wind

89
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,080
and solar which are actually are making

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,319
some difference but it's barely keeping

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,519
up with the increase in energy demand

92
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,760
worldwide so when we say things like

93
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
well don't build more coal power plants

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
country blank or something you know

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,200
we've got some hutzpah I have to say is

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,920
in terms of the West to me it's moral

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,640
issue it's like how can we tell you not

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,319
to deploy energy when we got rich and

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,239
wealthy by by using these energy sources

100
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,000
ourselves it's like now we're saying oh

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,480
no no you're doomed to Poverty because

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,280
we're not going to let you actually use

103
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,000
energy so I'm a scientist people don't

104
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,639
think of me as a as like a philosopher

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,199
around these I feel energy is the moral

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,400
issue of our time and it's because

107
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,720
energy is linked to human well-being

108
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,000
because it's linked to economic

109
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,080
well-being and by denying people access

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,880
to clean energy it's a moral issue so if

111
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,919
about 80% of our basic energy comes from

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,240
burning fossil fuels white says you need

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,520
an energy source that is usable on

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,320
demand that's scalable and creating such

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,520
a source is not a problem that's easy to

116
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,680
solve so right now if you even if I just

117
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,560
came along with a magic solution that

118
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,479
can provide carbon free electricity at

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,039
arbitrary levels we still can't use it

120
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,759
actually because our electrical grid not

121
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,639
tolerate the ability to actually

122
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,160
transmit that much more power and what

123
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,120
do I mean by use it you just like we

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,039
just replaced all liquid fuel

125
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,800
transportation with electric vehicles

126
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,199
now the grid literally cannot operate

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,199
because you don't have the transmission

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,479
capabilities and there's a subset of

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,120
people who make arguments that we have

130
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,479
all of the Technologies now to

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,960
decarbonize in my opinion that is false

132
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,280
we we actually do not have the

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,280
Technologies and what and what I make it

134
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,280
clear here is that Fusion is one of

135
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,560
those things which is driven by

136
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,240
technology which we should try to do

137
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,080
because it has the features of what I

138
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,120
just said right that it is carbon free

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,960
it's intense and it's on demand you

140
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,440
can't change that part of of Renewables

141
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,880
which I'm not against Renewables it's

142
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,720
just that they're they're part of the

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,840
solution it's extremely unlikely from a

144
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,759
science point of view that they're going

145
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,280
to be the total solution so let me just

146
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,000
qualify a little bit what you said for

147
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,759
our listeners cuz they'll be saying gee

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
we do have wind and solar and batteries

149
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,000
and we do have the Technologies we need

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,199
but I think what you're saying is that

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,759
the scale that we would need to deploy

152
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,280
those at is Impractical it's impractical

153
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,199
particularly not only to decarbonize our

154
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,160
electricity sources but all the other

155
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,360
things and which is only approximately

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,360
20 or 25% of our energy use comes from

157
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,240
making electricity we need things that

158
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,400
solve air travel and longrange

159
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,080
transportation and Industrial uses of

160
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
heat and all these other things and and

161
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,680
the further you go away from electricity

162
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,400
also this the science of of Renewables

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,440
of wind and solar get worse not better

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,440
and there's that's the reason they

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
haven't been deployed in those areas is

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,639
this other funny thing that goes on too

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,120
with with the transformation of our

168
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
Energy System you know with the

169
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,319
expansion of electricity using solar and

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,440
wind they inherently distributed forms

171
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,599
of generation they're all over the place

172
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,120
and and that necessitates a a

173
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,960
simultaneous change in the structure of

174
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
the grid it goes from being a

175
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,080
centralized source that that's radiating

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,639
outward through the wires to one that's

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,800
more of a mesh right and and that's an

178
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,440
expensive thing to do and it's also a

179
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,720
complicated thing for grid operators to

180
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,599
make a system like that work optimally

181
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,520
one of the nice things about nuclear

182
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,599
whether we're talking about fision or

183
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,319
Fusion is that like coal plants and gas

184
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,479
plants these are these are large

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,680
centralized plants we can literally drop

186
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,319
them into the grid as the grid now is

187
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,960
configured okay so you're saying I get

188
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,039
it solar and wind sort of they're good

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,720
but they're not going to do it all is

190
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,720
there anything else you know Fusion

191
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,400
again it's still in the future is there

192
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,520
anything else that exists right now we

193
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,159
could go with I mean we could go with

194
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,560
regular nuclear energy there are nuclear

195
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,240
power plants out there and they're

196
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,680
producing energy like right this second

197
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,319
and they're powering things so like why

198
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,560
think about something

199
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,800
that's maybe could work out and maybe

200
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,039
won't work out right so I am fully

201
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,720
supportive of

202
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,400
certainly that we should keep using our

203
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,680
present nuclear Fleet as well too and I

204
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,680
think we should expand it because it is

205
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,000
a solution that is right in front of us

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,639
this will get back to my discussions

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,360
about Fusion actually this shouldn't be

208
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,240
Dennis White's opinion about what energy

209
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,120
we should have we should do it's by the

210
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,720
way it's it's the other reason the 82%

211
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,919
doesn't move it's economics right if

212
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,479
Fusion Energy was less expensive andal

213
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,400
nuclear absolutely standard fision

214
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,479
nuclear power plants and they met the

215
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,800
market demands better then they would

216
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,320
they would be used more as well too so

217
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,200
all of that's good and that's exactly

218
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,839
what we should do so Fusion is

219
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,800
interesting because it uses literally

220
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,399
the opposite physics in many ways of

221
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,560
what fision does but it has features in

222
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,600
it which are as you pointed out Rob are

223
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,200
are similar right is that you get really

224
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,120
large amounts of power you have fairly

225
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
good access to fuel it's just

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,920
interesting there's sort of more social

227
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,080
and safety implications for fion but

228
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,959
those we figured out how to how to do

229
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,800
those but this also gets back to the

230
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,839
to my first graph and so forth what you

231
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,320
have to realize we are not solving the

232
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,720
problem for us for the United States in

233
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,920
many ways we've got it easy we have

234
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,040
really quite clean air we've got good

235
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,399
emissions controlled we have a really

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,240
robust mix of different energy uses got

237
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,800
Hydro nuclear gas really cheap uh gas

238
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,399
all those things what we're actually

239
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,120
solving for is how do you decarbonize a

240
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,959
growing economy like India's we need to

241
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,839
provide something to them so they're not

242
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,000
going to build more coal plants because

243
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,279
they're going to keep lifting their

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,240
people out of poverty by using energy

245
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,480
like let's let's not use coal to do that

246
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,440
but they're going to keep using coal to

247
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,600
do that and and by the way over the last

248
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,839
10 years or maybe even less India's gone

249
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,480
from having something like 60%

250
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,160
electrification to very close to 100%

251
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,920
electrification And it's because of coal

252
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,640
it's because of coal and they very

253
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,800
aggressively expanding that Fleet and

254
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,440
people are living better so I have a

255
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,600
question for you R when India thinks

256
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,800
about this question of the energy mix

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,279
and let's say thinks about traditional

258
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,120
nuclear is it all a monetary Dennis

259
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,720
you're talking about the kind of

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,680
economic push back is there also a

261
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,839
social pushback yeah there is I mean

262
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,480
India you know unlike us again lacks

263
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,279
this sort of enormous amount of land

264
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,040
that we have and they have a very high

265
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,680
population density and it's it's hard to

266
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,720
site nuclear power plants in the United

267
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,880
States it's really hard to site nuclear

268
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,680
power plants in crowded countries so

269
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,040
that's a challenge for them but I think

270
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,880
I think their their attraction to coal

271
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,880
and the same is true in China to a large

272
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,720
degree is that it's just so inexpensive

273
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,800
and when you're in a poor country and

274
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,279
the difference between having

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,120
electricity and not having electricity

276
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,279
is

277
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,279
money that's a powerful driving

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,480
force yeah and then there are

279
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,240
geopolitical consequences to to the use

280
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,880
of fision right because it is the the

281
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,880
the same technologies that you use to

282
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,000
make fision work have connections to

283
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,040
proliferation right because they're

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,360
they're linked by the by the science of

285
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,279
it now again we have good safeguards in

286
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,920
place and we do those things but it is a

287
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,839
complexity right uh around Vision that

288
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,240
that's certainly true now the Chinese

289
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,480
are advancing quite rapidly in building

290
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,440
up a nuclear Fleet it's not as big as

291
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,920
ours yet but it will be in a few years

292
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,519
the rate they're going and that's

293
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,560
different from the Indian

294
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,839
situation and it's not because China's

295
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,279
less crowded but they've got a lot more

296
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,120
power within the central government to

297
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,639
make these exciting decisions there's

298
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,760
some indication that that Chinese people

299
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,839
are not happy about that although they

300
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,720
are happy to have electricity and is

301
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,399
that also a question of money that the

302
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,200
the government's just like willing to

303
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,920
spend What It Takes yes and and you know

304
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,959
the Chinese are very very good at

305
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,279
manufacturing things and carrying out

306
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,639
large projects you know impressively so

307
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,800
and they're able to build these plants

308
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,440
much more inexpensively than we are here

309
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,920
and to some degree they're driven toward

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,360
that because they lack our abundance of

311
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
Natural Resources they don't have the

312
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,639
hydro capacity that we have they have

313
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,839
some they don't have the natural gas

314
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,480
capacity that we have and so that's

315
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,040
driving them down a different path and

316
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,959
the same sort of decisions play out in

317
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,680
different ways all around the world the

318
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:13,600
Japanese of course have even fewer

319
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,440
natural resources and are forced to make

320
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,079
decisions that would be impossible for

321
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,959
us to make here so far so so I think you

322
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,040
know conventional if you like nuclear

323
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,360
power has a role in the near term as

324
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,519
these countries convert and build up

325
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,680
their electricity supplies I think

326
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,560
what's exciting about Fusion is that it

327
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,040
enables us to open up yet another

328
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,120
direction that that is more socially

329
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,440
acceptable I think in this country and

330
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,519
that's because of the nature of the fuel

331
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,399
and the fact that Fusion plants aren't

332
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,880
going to produce the same large

333
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,920
quantities of nuclear waste that our

334
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,160
fision plants produce and that's been a

335
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,360
problem for social acceptance here yeah

336
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,800
guess who is racing towards Fusion

337
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,399
Energy

338
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,199
China uh exactly for the same reasons

339
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,399
that Rob just pointed out because if

340
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:09,399
it's sustainability it's a technology in

341
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,600
the end like a Fusion Energy industry

342
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,199
will have an enormous supply chain

343
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
that's pushing around these integrated

344
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,920
Technologies of pushing those forward

345
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,959
China wants to be a leader in that not

346
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,720
just for its own energy use in fact I I

347
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,000
would believe if I was them also for the

348
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,199
geopolitical influence that'll bring as

349
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,040
well too do you have a sense of what

350
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,880
that race between the US and China looks

351
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,800
like with Fusion are they head or they

352
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,600
are ahead is it like cled enough in

353
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,440
secrecy that you don't really know how

354
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,519
far ahead so maybe I will actually I'll

355
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
I'll

356
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,600
uh no no it's it's it's a good question

357
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,800
but but it has like most of these they

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,399
don't have simple answers is that if you

359
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,759
if you look at the government program of

360
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,600
China right now and its National intent

361
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,360
this is this is ahead of the United

362
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,279
States's National program we do not have

363
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,880
a national policy that says we are going

364
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,680
to develop Fusion energy we we should

365
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,240
right right and in that sense of what

366
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,920
what they're doing they're doing it in a

367
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,160
very centralized way that China can

368
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,279
bring to these kinds of uh this these

369
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,759
kinds of problems they just recently

370
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,920
announced in fact effectively an

371
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,959
industrial Consortium that they're going

372
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,800
to put the whole thing they're going to

373
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,440
put their shoulder behind that wheel and

374
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,240
push it it's not just well we're going

375
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,079
to give more money to research labs to

376
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,240
look at Fusion we're going to employ

377
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,920
basically all of these tools that we've

378
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,040
built up in our IND industrial toolkit

379
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,680
of steel manufacturing of their existing

380
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,959
nuclear industry concrete manufacturing

381
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,880
the whole thing and their stated goals

382
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,199
we're going to beat the West to Fusion

383
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,199
Energy so now but but you say are we are

384
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,199
we behind or ahead the one thing we're

385
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,440
where we are ahead is an

386
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,199
innovation this casts itself into a lot

387
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,759
of the other kinds of um challenges we

388
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,560
have around these two very different

389
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,839
systems about how you get to the goal

390
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,720
line and the the Chinese will have a

391
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,120
very centralized program and put

392
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,040
everything behind it and they they've

393
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,880
got their act together about figured it

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,839
out and they're very good technologists

395
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,800
and engineers and all those things but

396
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,519
you know the US I'll make it a little

397
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,040
bit broader like the UK and probably

398
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,600
Western Europe as well too our system

399
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,759
favors like inventiveness and Innovation

400
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,279
you know and so oh that's good and we've

401
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,240
got companies that are trying to

402
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,920
innovate their way to better products

403
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,839
you know it's interesting about which

404
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,920
one will win I'm not sure so this

405
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,360
reminds me of of your creation story so

406
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,079
to speak I mean talk about the

407
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
government not leaning into something

408
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,120
you when you were the head of the

409
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,880
nuclear Department here the government

410
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,800
withdrew funding yes and and applied it

411
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,759
instead to a Consortium called eer

412
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,720
that's operating in in South France to

413
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,519
build a reactor there but basically

414
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,480
withdrew their support for Fusion

415
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,839
research in the United States in the

416
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,519
University system at any rate so the

417
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,800
government was like yeah we're funding

418
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,199
fusion and uh research at MIT

419
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,920
yeah now we're done what happened

420
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:08,000
um

421
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,560
yes it's complicated again as usual so

422
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,519
part of it was it was an evaluation

423
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,560
about where Fusion was and this is

424
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,360
approximately 10 years ago that this

425
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,800
decision came down and so it's

426
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,279
interesting everybody kind of knew where

427
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,319
Fusion was going right we should U make

428
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,720
it clear like Fusion at this point was a

429
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,279
science Endeavor it was this was not

430
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,120
about Fusion Energy at all Okay and like

431
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,279
a lot of other Sciences like in the big

432
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,319
physical sciences like accelerators and

433
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,680
so forth the general Trend was are we're

434
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,120
going to go we're going to get bigger

435
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,959
and bigger to be able to and mean bigger

436
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,920
projects bigger checks that you have to

437
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,880
write and so forth we're going to get

438
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,279
bigger in this uh it leans towards

439
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,759
International collaboration and you know

440
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
if you sort of take CERN as a good

441
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,959
example you know in in Europe or these

442
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,279
other or International Space Station you

443
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,399
know these are good examples and and

444
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,800
this is where everyone saw Fusion was

445
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,240
going right and so what I mean was that

446
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,039
the next stages of science exploration

447
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,160
we're going to be in bigger projects not

448
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,919
smaller projects hence they all saw that

449
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,679
it's always 50 years in theut right and

450
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,160
and and and that made sense too here's

451
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,559
this project is going to take you know

452
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,480
whatever at that point it was going to

453
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,880
take still 10 years to construct it we

454
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,679
knew this the big thing where they

455
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,240
accelerate that's the big thing that

456
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,280
accelerates around even physically so

457
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,199
that takes all that accumulates all the

458
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,480
the countries in Europe and all that and

459
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,520
so this was just infusion looked like it

460
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,120
was just sitting in that usual trend of

461
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,600
this so you know smallscale University

462
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,440
experiments looked less and less

463
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,640
relevant right now I can make some

464
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,160
arguments about the fact that we weren't

465
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,960
irrelevant but for interesting

466
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
reasons is that it so there's some some

467
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,559
great irony in this like we were never

468
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,400
really to I mean in the end the the

469
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
political reality was there needed to be

470
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,919
budget freed up to be able to pay for

471
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,320
these extremely much larger experiments

472
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,960
and we not going to go small right so

473
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,760
this wasn't about effectiveness it

474
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,440
wasn't about uh like you know the the

475
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
science wasn't any good anymore and so

476
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,960
forth this just like that's the trend

477
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,240
and we're going to go there so I have to

478
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,280
say there's some great irony in this and

479
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,400
it's like what what is this is because

480
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,000
what has happened a a lot because of not

481
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,799
just because of what we did but a lot

482
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,400
because of what we did at MIT in the in

483
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,559
the start of Comm Fusion systems is that

484
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,559
we changed the narrative that it wasn't

485
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,799
just about science anymore is the idea

486
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,480
that we should actually think about

487
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,440
making this an energy source right

488
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,080
and in order to make it an energy source

489
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
you looked at um you looked at these

490
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,400
enormous International projects and you

491
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,520
did a quick calculation how much would

492
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,159
they cost per watt like what's the

493
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,960
dollars per watt this is how you

494
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,760
basically make keep score for energy

495
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,000
sources um and it showed it wasn't even

496
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,799
close I mean it's it it was like a

497
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,840
factor of a more or less like aund away

498
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,600
from other kinds of energy sources oh it

499
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,960
was like a 100 times expensive more

500
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,200
expensive for the same am yeah

501
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,120
collaborative in France yeah not even on

502
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,120
a commercial trajectory not not on a

503
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,360
commercial trajectory so it is so and

504
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,159
this is it is what it is it's a science

505
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,799
experiment about accessing that next

506
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,960
level of science so there's some great

507
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,440
irony in this as I always said is that

508
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,559
it turned out what we were doing at MIT

509
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,480
for science reasons and to keep it at a

510
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,919
scale that actually made sense for a

511
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,520
university we were using a particular

512
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,760
path which exploited access to very high

513
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,080
magnetic fields cuz it was a specialty

514
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,600
of what we did at MIT in in sort of the

515
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,280
history of MIT and the reason we did

516
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,480
that was to keep it intentionally very

517
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,640
small but High

518
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,520
performing and and in the end it's just

519
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,520
like oh the realization that there could

520
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,679
be a possibility of Translating that

521
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,799
into an argument for economic Fusion was

522
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,960
really what launched like the thing that

523
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,120
changed the trajectory for mit's Fusion

524
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,000
program and for I would argue about

525
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,120
setting us on a really valid path

526
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,520
towards Fusion as a power source so in

527
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,280
many ways they have different purposes

528
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,039
there's also an irony in it is that in a

529
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,320
weird way maybe that cancelling made us

530
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,000
think about what we were and it made me

531
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,520
think personally of what we were I was

532
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
in Fusion to do science I never really

533
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,159
thought of it as an energy source I that

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,720
the next Generations will maybe do that

535
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,360
and then what was dropped into our lap

536
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,919
was really an opportunity to translate

537
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,799
our science expertise into the idea of

538
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,159
actually making an energy source so wait

539
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,640
how did the withdrawing of funding and

540
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,840
the US government being like this is

541
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,799
kind of it sounds like this is kind of

542
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,480
small potatoes we need to we need to put

543
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:42,240
our bets on like sort of do the big bets

544
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,960
here how did that lead MIT to really a

545
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,360
place where like this stuff is being

546
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,360
commercialized I mean it's it's strange

547
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,400
that the money got taken away and then

548
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,159
things started to accelerate people

549
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,799
might look at it oh this was just a

550
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,280
different way because I know there's

551
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,640
some critics of this they go you just

552
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,600
convince some rich people to basically

553
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,200
give you money like through the private

554
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,880
sector to keep doing your sort of

555
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,720
science experiment um no no what it was

556
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,679
was actually it was an internal

557
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,960
transformation for a large part of us

558
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,720
inside the team at the plasma science

559
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,159
infusion center that realized we should

560
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,799
actually try to make an energy source I

561
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,320
remember the day when we said because we

562
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,440
had we worked on this plan which is

563
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,919
basically take our idea High Fields

564
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,159
confinement device these high magnetic

565
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,080
field confinement devices we came up

566
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,480
with a valid technical plan

567
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,720
but really our biggest commitment in

568
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,960
change was thinking of ourselves as

569
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,760
energy developers rather than scient

570
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,840
just scientists now obviously there's

571
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,600
science and technology that is behind

572
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,120
that that Evolution was the biggest

573
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,000
single change in my professional career

574
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,520
and the good part of it was to say oh

575
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,360
and we've got the team to be able to

576
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,039
execute this which was what we had at

577
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,000
the Plazma science infusion center and

578
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,679
then eventually spinning out in fact

579
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,080
commonw Fusion systems about doing that

580
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,200
but we were way too isol ated and

581
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,400
insulated in fact from the energy

582
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,640
development World in fact part of one of

583
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,440
the great um things that we did was walk

584
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,520
over to the energy initiative and

585
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,600
actually start learning about you know I

586
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,799
never talked to anybody in the energy

587
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,720
sector it's like oh no we're just we're

588
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,440
just physicists really playing with with

589
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,320
our toys it's like so walking over to a

590
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,679
place like the energy initiative MIT

591
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,559
also woke us up it's like holy cow it's

592
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,760
like this is actually what it's going to

593
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,559
look like what you're you just said Rob

594
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,080
right schedules timelines resource and

595
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
when you come with that and and put

596
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,400
yourself in that position then it's very

597
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,960
interesting it it still forces by the

598
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,279
way amazing science it's just that

599
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,279
you're working towards a different

600
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,800
[Music]

601
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,960
goal now Commonwealth Fusion systems

602
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,799
which you've talked about which spun out

603
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,559
of MIT which would you say it's the

604
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,760
leader in Fusion right now in the

605
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,600
private sector

606
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,320
so I know it's raised money from rich

607
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,039
people as you mention before so if

608
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,880
you're talking to a rich person who's

609
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,320
not a physicist and you're like this is

610
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,159
why you should give us money are you

611
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,159
like are you on their Board of advisors

612
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,080
or are you affiliated with the company I

613
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,440
have no it's for other reasons I can

614
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,880
explain but I have no official

615
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,919
affiliation with Ashley common but let's

616
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,159
say either you or they were like you

617
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,960
should give us money rich person to fund

618
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,640
this it's really very important how

619
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,320
would you to an ordinary person explain

620
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,080
what it is they funding and why they

621
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,760
should do it what is Fusion right so

622
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,440
well well so so Fusion is the fusing

623
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,400
together of of of hydrogen to produce

624
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,840
energy so this is the same process that

625
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,520
powers Stars our own Sun as well too it

626
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,679
happens in the middle of of the sun and

627
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,600
the most um well-known condition for

628
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,200
this has to get very hot it has to be

629
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,520
above on Earth it has to be above about

630
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
50 million degrees cels no by hot you

631
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,919
mean the the the hydrogen atoms have a

632
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,440
lot of has to get hot right so in the

633
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,960
middle of our sun it's about 20 million

634
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,679
de C and this gets hot enough that

635
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,240
basically it allows the hydrogen to push

636
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,039
against each other close enough that the

637
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,600
fusion can occur and again on Earth

638
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,400
about the minimum temperatur is about 50

639
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,760
million degrees C and and then there's a

640
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
requirement that you basic have to have

641
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
enough fuel around in order to create

642
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,520
enough Fusion reactions that then keeps

643
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,240
itself hot right and so once it gets to

644
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,600
that point it becomes like a star that

645
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,159
and basically it starts keeping itself

646
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,679
hot through its own Fusion reactions and

647
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,200
so it as we say it's a even though it

648
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,600
uses somewhat different reactions it's

649
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,200
basically the same thing as what's

650
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,159
happening in the middle of a of of a

651
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,880
star and they're being these these atoms

652
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,799
are being confined because the star is a

653
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,559
star it's a massive object can't get

654
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,320
away from each other exactly so Fusion

655
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,559
only works in one place naturally in the

656
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,080
universe it's in the center of stars and

657
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,279
the reason for this is because of their

658
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,120
enormous size so the containment of this

659
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,880
like it's 20 million degrees in the

660
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,320
center it's only 5,000 Dees it's like

661
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,039
way way it's a thousand times colder on

662
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,000
the on the surface of the Sun how does

663
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,159
that Center stay hot well because it

664
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,640
can't go anywhere because it's contained

665
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,399
it's confined by the gravity of the sun

666
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,720
itself and gravity as as you know Rob

667
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,039
gravity is the weakest of the

668
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,480
fundamental forces of nature by a lot

669
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,600
hard to reproduce yes and and and it

670
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,279
takes that's actually why you know so

671
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,520
Jupiter is interesting is actually has

672
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,919
almost the same composition as the sun

673
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,120
but it's not a star because it's not

674
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,000
quite big enough so there no really

675
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,720
except for some exotic examples there's

676
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,840
not really small functioning Stars

677
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,279
around so you cannot translate that

678
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,320
directly to Earth you need a much

679
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,440
stronger force and what you use is the

680
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,320
electromagnetic forces which are much

681
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,760
much stronger in fact than than gravity

682
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,520
so this goes to your question about like

683
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,000
what happens is that turns out that the

684
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,720
force that you're applying for the

685
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,360
containment is that you trade off you

686
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,919
can keep something hot by making it

687
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,640
larger like a like a star or in fact

688
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,279
this is what eater and other things like

689
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,000
this make themselves really really big

690
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:06,799
and that will keep it hotter longer or

691
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,279
you can apply a more effective force and

692
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,200
that force is a magnetic force and that

693
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,320
and that goes that comes from the making

694
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,880
this magnetic field that is produced by

695
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,720
electromagnets and so there's always a

696
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,399
trade-off between large which allows you

697
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,240
to keep it hot versus more Force the

698
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:25,760
analogy we use is that it's kind of like

699
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,600
a keeping your home warm is that you do

700
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,120
it in two one one of the ways is to just

701
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,880
like make it really really big like make

702
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,840
the walls like super super thick or you

703
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,000
improve the quality of the insulator got

704
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,240
it right and so making the magnetic

705
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,880
field stronger makes the insulator way

706
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,000
better and what it allows you to do is

707
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,440
it makes the object smaller but still

708
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,960
get the same containment that was the

709
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,080
science of it but it turns out the

710
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,760
economic impacts of this are staggering

711
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,840
because Fusion is a very interesting

712
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,399
energy source what you pay for is the

713
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,840
thing that you build the fuel is free

714
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:00,159
and it lasts forever

715
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,399
what you're paying for is the

716
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,279
containment system okay right so in this

717
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:06,120
particular one um which isn't the only

718
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,600
way to get to Fusion but it's that's the

719
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,520
one Commonwealth uses and the most

720
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,480
prevalent one right now you end up

721
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,880
building large electromagnets which make

722
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,279
a a containment cage which hold the hot

723
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,080
fuel so it actually costs very little

724
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,279
money and very little energy to get it

725
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,480
hot what's hard is the

726
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,440
containment they want to fly apart from

727
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,919
one

728
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,000
another keep to keep it hot continually

729
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,279
okay so then you have this very hot

730
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,720
thing y but the problem isn't solved yet

731
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,120
because like I want to power that

732
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,000
factory down the road and I want to

733
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,120
power my house so yeah so Fusion sounds

734
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,799
very exotic in a way you know it's

735
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,320
happening like this the process the

736
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,120
power of the star but in the end the the

737
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,120
what happens is that the fusion where

738
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,600
where is Fusion Energy when the fusion

739
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,519
occurs the energy is released it's

740
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,799
literally in the velocity or the kinetic

741
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,720
energy of the particles that are come

742
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,440
out they're the same particles as before

743
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,000
they're just rearranged by equals MC squ

744
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,440
they just have an enormous amount of

745
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,039
energy so what you do is you stick

746
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,679
something in front of those particles

747
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,720
and get back the energy and how you get

748
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
back the energy is you force them but

749
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,159
they basically bounce around like

750
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,600
billiard balls almost is the right

751
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,080
inside of the material and what you do

752
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,640
is you put some engineered object and we

753
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,480
call this a blanket because it kind of

754
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,159
surrounds or the fusion device that then

755
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,159
gets hot because those particles are

756
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,440
forced to give their energy into into

757
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,360
regular matter and it gets hot that's it

758
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,480
like so Fusion makes heat okay so the

759
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:39,440
engineered thing that we make is heat

760
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,200
this is why it's so lovely Fusion is

761
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,760
because heat is this is basically almost

762
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,600
all our energy sources is what we do is

763
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,159
we make heat with them right and and

764
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,919
then we do something with the heat like

765
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,840
make electricity or we make fuels or we

766
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,960
do or what whatever the thing is that

767
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,720
you want to do that's actually what

768
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,279
Fusion makes in the end so this the

769
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,120
almost your your vision of this is you

770
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:04,720
build an object it costs you something

771
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,760
to build this object right this complex

772
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,640
object then after that the fuel is you

773
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,440
can just burn arbitrary amounts of fuel

774
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,600
in the thing because it's almost for

775
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,039
free and then what's coming out of it is

776
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,080
heat that's why I get excited about

777
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:21,360
ideas that of like how would we use

778
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,679
Fusion not just to to make electricity

779
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,559
but to actually get after that 82%

780
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,279
business so the rich person that you're

781
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,919
pitching is too says uh-huh uh-huh um

782
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:35,279
when when will this be powering um like

783
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,320
what's your timeline here for powering

784
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,159
homes and factories so okay it's

785
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,399
interesting so it depends about who the

786
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,240
you know the person might be often those

787
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,559
people by the way are are in the

788
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,720
positions they are because they're

789
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,919
technologists okay yeah so to that

790
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,600
person I would describe what we're doing

791
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,519
I actually wouldn't get into the details

792
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,399
imediately of the physics and so forth I

793
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,679
would just you know I would I look at

794
00:29:55,399 --> 00:30:02,360
this laptop right yeah um or or an

795
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,559
iPhone yeah and I would go you realize

796
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,320
like the they know this right the

797
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,320
Decades of science Innovations like when

798
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,600
when shocky invented the transistor

799
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,440
could he have imagined an iPhone right

800
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,080
but you realize that these are

801
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,240
fundamental pivot Points in the

802
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,200
understanding of the science and

803
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,120
technology and then you're working on

804
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,320
these things and all that information

805
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,039
Theory all these things and then at some

806
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,200
point you realize holy cow I can

807
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:32,600
actually put this together into

808
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,679
product and so all of those I guess most

809
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,120
of those very rich people are there

810
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,080
because they saw an aspect of an idea of

811
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,159
of commercializing something that just

812
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,799
looked like science fiction at the time

813
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,519
right and I was go that's what's

814
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,000
happening in INF Fusion it's like yeah

815
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,840
there are details about what the

816
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,640
technology will look like and so forth

817
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,679
the most important thing is that we've

818
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,919
built now or we've got the entities

819
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,880
called companies which are trying to

820
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,279
build a product

821
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,080
and that doesn't sound like much of a

822
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:05,200
breakthrough does it but it is because

823
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,519
until you have that you actually have

824
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,399
zero chance of actually making an energy

825
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,600
product because who can deliver it right

826
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,799
so I that's what I say to them is like

827
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,200
so come into this Eyes Wide Open

828
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,919
understand that some of the approaches

829
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,799
are not going to work right but what the

830
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,919
goal is it's not just fun sence it's

831
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,760
actually to make an economically viable

832
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,600
energy product and when you do that like

833
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,799
what you have is a possibility to

834
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,159
displace A10 trillion a year economy

835
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,159
which is basically the worldwide energy

836
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,840
right sector that's that's the argument

837
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,519
that you make and they all get that it's

838
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,200
just like what did Amazon disrupt right

839
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,240
retail right because of the invention of

840
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,039
the internet right which they didn't do

841
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,720
but they were the they pounced on that

842
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,320
opportunity I could just go on and on

843
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,559
about like we're surrounded here at MIT

844
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,720
by biotech biotech was built on Decades

845
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,279
of underlying scientific research and

846
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,440
all of a sudden wow we can edit the

847
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,279
human we can edit genes we can do these

848
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,240
things which actually allow us to do

849
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,120
things that looked impossible like even

850
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,399
20 years ago and you don't just mean

851
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,360
biotech like in Labs you mean like Merc

852
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,960
and fiser no like the companies came out

853
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,240
look at what and also to the people that

854
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,080
go oh this this is all going to be slow

855
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,399
you can't go fast like again look around

856
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,240
where we are right holy cow again we got

857
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:28,679
we got a vaccine like that fast right

858
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,320
against a global pandemic when we're

859
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,440
trying to solve really important

860
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,519
problems we can go fast and we go we go

861
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,440
fast by innovating by having the right

862
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,200
structures around us again imagine that

863
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,320
we were at a place and all we had and

864
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,960
this isn't against government LA because

865
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,919
curiosity based research absolutely

866
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,600
critical to these kinds of things but

867
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,880
imagine that came along and there were

868
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,760
no biotech companies how long do you

869
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,840
think it would have been I think we'd

870
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,720
still be waiting actually probably for a

871
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,240
vaccine far fewer of us or far yeah and

872
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,080
and they and it's because that's what

873
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,480
they're built to do right yeah so that

874
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,120
that's basically the the argument not

875
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,240
not just actually to the billionaires

876
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,320
but to us as a society right isn't this

877
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,880
what we should be doing so there are

878
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,840
these kinds of hard problems there's no

879
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,399
there's no blueprint for how you combine

880
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,600
those developments in science and and

881
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,880
our understanding into a working Fusion

882
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,679
reactor in fact there are a number of

883
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,919
startups around the world I last time I

884
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,360
looked there was something like 40 plus

885
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,840
trying it in different ways tell us a

886
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,279
little bit about the structure of that

887
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,960
sort of P Global right it's uh like I

888
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,240
almost can't believe I'm recording this

889
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,440
and saying there are 40 private sector

890
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,039
Fusion developers right this is so so so

891
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,600
part of it actually comes

892
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,399
from uh you how would how would it be

893
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,600
possible that there's 40 ways to do it

894
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:49,320
well this comes back as usual comes back

895
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,799
to some underlying science differences

896
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,880
in in Fusion the science of fusion

897
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,320
allows you to access high power and high

898
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,159
gain in just an staggering number of

899
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,840
ways and that's actually what these

900
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:04,279
approaches are in some sense exploiting

901
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,519
but also challenging because it's like

902
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:09,119
which one of those gets you to the goal

903
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,159
line which is economic product and so

904
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,040
then the answer about when you get there

905
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,960
actually becomes about how clever you

906
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,839
become how well you deploy the resources

907
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,320
and basically having a distributed

908
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,000
aspects of of many shots on goal in fact

909
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,839
to be able to do that we we call this

910
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,359
competition we call this the market

911
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,960
right and that's actually going to be

912
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:31,359
the answer by by the way not to pick on

913
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,200
it right but we already have Fusion

914
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,560
we've actually made Fusion happen in the

915
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,320
laboratory for a long time we've

916
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,919
actually you know the the experiment

917
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,520
here at MIT in something like only like

918
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,000
this big across was five times hotter

919
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,480
than the center of the sun right we have

920
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,320
experiments where we're making hundreds

921
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,480
of trillions of fusion reactions per

922
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,879
second the containment is absolutely

923
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,240
good we've actually made Fusion so let

924
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,359
me just the important point there is

925
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,560
it's not a burning plasma so to speak

926
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:00,280
it's not a burning plasma and and and

927
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,359
and and in fact now though by the fact

928
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,839
that we saw one at the national ignition

929
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:06,920
facility right we actually saw that as

930
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:09,359
well too so Fusion is not Science

931
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,480
Fiction it's not about that like we

932
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,880
already made Fusion what I'm talking

933
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,280
about what we when will we have Fusion

934
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,280
Energy Systems

935
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,320
commercialization but are are are is

936
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,400
this like give me a sense are we talking

937
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,880
like 10 years four year you know like

938
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,760
what's the scale you know people should

939
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,160
be thinking about can do it at right so

940
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,920
then that goes the specifics of each of

941
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,599
those kinds of approaches right so I can

942
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,640
speak to the one you know so what we did

943
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,400
was we we looked at and we we looked at

944
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,160
the scenario and said okay what would it

945
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,880
and we had the benefit by the way of the

946
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,920
particular particular approach with the

947
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,960
magnets like we' already built three of

948
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,680
them at MIT there had been sort of like

949
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,359
50 to 100 built around the world based

950
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,480
on the size and the complexity of them

951
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,359
we know how long they take to build

952
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,359
right and we said okay if we can

953
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,680
actually make this one we think it'll

954
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,359
take blank years to make this

955
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,079
fundamental technology development which

956
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,560
is the super conducting magnet then it

957
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,240
should take blank years to actually

958
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,200
build the Prototype and then blank years

959
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,520
to build the thing that goes on the

960
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,839
because we'd built them before so we

961
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,960
have that advantage and we added those

962
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:18,319
up in a very serious way and we said and

963
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,800
this was 2018 we said we're 15 years

964
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:22,280
it's like cuz it looks like that's how

965
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,119
long it takes and right now we're almost

966
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,839
exactly still on that timeline so that's

967
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,520
a decade from now so that's a decade

968
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,319
from now but I will just CAU every so

969
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,000
we're still on that pathway and there's

970
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:34,480
still challenges which are around on it

971
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,520
but at least we're making a try at it

972
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,160
right and imagine now you have a this

973
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,000
isn't just for your own country this can

974
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,640
scale to actually power the world

975
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
forever and you have control not just of

976
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,880
that particular design but all of the

977
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,359
things it takes to build it it's like so

978
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,960
just imagine a future where I I want to

979
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,240
see one where we develop in a political

980
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,119
system that actually that that favors

981
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,520
personal freedom and choices around

982
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,680
these things because in the end you know

983
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,960
it's going to be about people's

984
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,359
well-being that's why we want economic

985
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,560
clean energy sources I'm not sure if

986
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,440
we're going to win but I think we will

987
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,560
if we actually get our act together that

988
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,359
that namely you know and governments are

989
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,119
reflections of the societies that we

990
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,160
have it's like it almost goes back to my

991
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,480
beginning comments like we don't really

992
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,520
know first of all how hard this is going

993
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,400
to be about the energy transition like

994
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,160
rob you and I work in this every day I

995
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,880
still don't it's still hard to imagine

996
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,200
the SC of this and how hard it is but

997
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,560
it's like isn't this the thing worthy of

998
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,640
trying right tell me what there's where

999
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,240
there's a higher priority what if it

1000
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,960
works and then what if it works holy cow

1001
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,000
right and I think we should imagine a

1002
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,800
world where it works um in all all

1003
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,800
different kinds of ways yeah so so in

1004
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,839
that world there are going to be

1005
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,240
literally tens of thousands of fusion

1006
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,400
reactors if if we continue down this

1007
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,440
path what makes me worry is that that

1008
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,440
that's really a deployment story that's

1009
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,000
not an invention story and figuring out

1010
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,599
how to do it elegantly which is what

1011
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,640
we're doing right now in our current

1012
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,280
gener you know in our current phase of

1013
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,040
of

1014
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,200
commercialization this deployment is

1015
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,720
something that the Chinese have done

1016
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,359
particularly well they've you know we

1017
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,920
invented solar panels they own the

1018
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,760
industry we invented lithium ion

1019
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,280
batteries they own the industry we get

1020
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,040
the first electric cars they're got to

1021
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,000
own that too so how do you think about

1022
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,040
that deployment and winning that race

1023
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
not getting forced out of it what are we

1024
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,520
going to have do to build a global

1025
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,960
fusion industry in which we still

1026
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,400
play so we've got to figure out all

1027
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,800
kinds of things right it's a race in in

1028
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,800
some sense between two different kinds

1029
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,800
of development systems and the advantage

1030
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,560
I would argue that we have is is that it

1031
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,400
primarily gets driven by markets right

1032
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,319
and then what happens is that companies

1033
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,760
come in and make products that actually

1034
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:56,440
that that respond to the markets so what

1035
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,920
is the market it's about decarbonizing

1036
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,720
vast amounts of our energy sources as

1037
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,319
well too so I think what it looks like

1038
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,040
is I I am pretty sure it doesn't not

1039
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:10,280
look like a monolithic single design of

1040
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,040
a fusion device and and the reason for

1041
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,480
this is because energy itself as as you

1042
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,400
know is a very complex Market about how

1043
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,359
we what we actually use energy for and

1044
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,920
fusion has this adaptability and

1045
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,440
flexibility that comes from its

1046
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,720
underlying science of those things I

1047
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,760
described before that says there's all

1048
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,599
different kinds of ways to make make a

1049
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,040
product that respond in the energy

1050
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,440
market so I think what success looks

1051
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,920
like is actually multiple Energy

1052
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,520
Products you know you have to get past

1053
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,880
the goalpost of the science requirements

1054
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,560
around it obvious on that but if you get

1055
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,880
to that place then I I believe like the

1056
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Invisible Hand kind of wins right it's

1057
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,720
it's going to be that aspect of spurring

1058
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,480
on competition among different concepts

1059
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,880
and about what how you respond in the

1060
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,079
energy Market is that when you're coming

1061
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,240
up with a new product go after a market

1062
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,560
that almost not NE doesn't exist that

1063
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,800
has no other choices right around on

1064
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,839
that and I think we have a real chance

1065
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,520
of doing that through these 40 companies

1066
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,480
you know that are around not all of them

1067
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,119
are going to work but if you come up

1068
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,599
with a handful of different kinds of

1069
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,480
different kinds of Concepts that can

1070
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:18,440
actually respond to the energy Market

1071
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,359
that's what success is going to look

1072
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,119
like and I and I think that's why we can

1073
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:24,599
still you know win that race in fact if

1074
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,560
you you ask this question if I was in

1075
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,599
front of really wealthy person i' say

1076
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,160
please work with me so that I understand

1077
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,079
like how did we get all these other

1078
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,640
amazing Technologies because not

1079
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,680
repeating the mistakes of history but

1080
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,000
also learning from the the from the

1081
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,800
successes of these other sectors is to

1082
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
me a way that we can actually accelerate

1083
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,760
Fusion across the board and that's

1084
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,760
really what I where I personally feel U

1085
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:53,040
really um committed to uh learning about

1086
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,920
those aspects of it but also then

1087
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,319
working along with my Fusion colleagues

1088
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,319
to see about what we can actually

1089
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,960
deliver in the next decade cuz if we can

1090
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,440
deliver a few of them like a few pilot
