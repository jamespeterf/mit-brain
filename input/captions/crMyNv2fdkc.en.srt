00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,119
the probabilistic method in

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,279
combinatorics is a powerful method that

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,359
can be used to demonstrate the existence

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,519
of some object by introducing

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,160
Randomness in this video we'll look at a

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,000
basic example illustrating an

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,039
application of the probabilistic method

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,040
we'll show this theorem over here which

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:37,120
says that if G is a graph with M edges

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,440
then G has a bipartite subgraph with at

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,719
least M over two edges so let me remind

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,960
you the definition of a bipar graph is

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,680
one where I can partition the vertices

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,760
into two halves or two sets of vertices

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,600
and all the

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:01,120
edges go from one side to the other so

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,120
that's an example of a bipartite graph

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,280
and what this theorem is saying is that

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,840
if we start with any graph G

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,560
with some number of edges in this case

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,680
five

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,759
edges I can find a pretty large subgraph

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,079
by keeping at least half of the edges of

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,000
G for example we can do this keeping

25
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,159
four of the five edges to get this

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,840
subgraph G Prime and this graph G Prime

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,079
is now bipart

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,759
because I

29
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,840
can put these two vertices on one

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,079
side and these two vertices on the other

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,040
side so that you see all the edges go

32
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,719
from the red or the pink vertices to the

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
green vertices and none between the pink

34
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,920
and none between the

35
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,320
greens so this is an example of um

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,119
finding a large bipar subgraph in a

37
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,479
graph G now let me prove this theorem

38
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
illustrating the probabilistic

39
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:15,040
method so we're given this graph G and

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,200
what we'll do is

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,319
assign

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,160
a

43
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,160
color which will be either black or

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,840
white

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,840
uniformly and independently at random

46
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,159
to each

47
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,120
vertex of the graph

48
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:55,040
G so imagine flipping a coin for each

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,000
vertex and coloring each vertex black or

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,280
white after doing this we can put all

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,840
the white vertices of G on one side and

52
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,400
all the black vertices of G on the other

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,480
side okay so now G has some number of

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,599
vertices and there will be some edges

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,720
going across from white to black some

56
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,080
edges within white and some edges within

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,599
black there could be a lot more edges

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,879
but that's an example of what this graph

59
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,519
might look

60
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,680
like and now let me take G Prime to be

61
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,680
the subgraph

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:40,400
consisting of

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,480
edges with white on one end and black on

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,159
the other end so two different colors on

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,319
the two edges two end points of this

66
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,840
Edge this is a subgraph it's a subset of

67
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,159
the edges of

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,760
G and note

69
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,200
that

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,599
every

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,400
edge of G

72
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,439
has

73
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,920
probability 1 half of

74
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,640
Being in G Prime because for this Edge

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,439
there are four different

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,519
possibilities for what the endpoint

77
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,720
colors might look like and these four

78
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,000
possibilities are equally likely and

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,240
exactly two of them will create an edge

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,240
that falls in G

81
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:33,560
Prime now knowing this by linearity of

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,400
expectations the number of

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,759
edges

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,759
of G

85
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:54,080
Prime here G Prime is a random subgraph

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,680
right where G is given G Prime depends

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,800
on the coin flips that we made to assign

88
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,000
colors so it's a random subgraph so the

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,160
number of edges of G Prime is a random

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,360
variable but this random variable has an

91
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,320
expectation and we can compute this

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,840
expectation using linear of expectations

93
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,639
because each Edge Falls in G Prime with

94
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:18,520
probability 1/2 and therefore the total

95
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:21,199
expected number of edges in gpre is

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,800
m/2 this is the expectation this is what

97
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,800
happens on

98
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,919
average

99
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,919
does some instance

100
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,039
of G

101
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,840
Prime

102
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:42,800
has at least m/2

103
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,720
edges right if on average we get M over2

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,160
edges then there must be some instance

105
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,160
with at least M over2 edges and this G

106
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,520
Prime is what we're looking

107
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,680
for it has at least M over two edges and

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,080
it is bipartite because we've kept all

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:13,440
the edges from the black side to the

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:15,560
white side and so this G Prime is

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,319
bipartite this finishes the proof of the

112
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,960
theorem and you see that by introducing

113
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,000
Randomness we can prove something about

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,240
the existence of a structure with

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,039
desired properties and it's a hmark of

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,000
the probabilistic method and it's an

117
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,599
important meth me that has lot of

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,080
applications and this is one of the

119
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,080
simplest examples of its applications
