1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,359
Thank you everyone. Um I'm Sake. I'm the

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,440
co-founder and CSO at Blue Shift. And

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,360
I'm joined by my co-founder and CEO

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,599
Deep. And we are working on um AI

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,039
powered crit AI powered electrochemical

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,520
systems for critical minerals

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,480
extraction. What that means is

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,320
the demand for lithium, nickel, raers

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,119
and copper is increasing but the orgrade

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,280
quality is decreasing. And so what that

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,680
means is we need to put in more energy

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
to extract the same amount of materials.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,239
We need to move more earth to extract

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,640
the same amount of materials and meet

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,480
the growing demands.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,600
Um and in addition um the US is

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,280
dependent on external or foreign sources

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,480
for a lot of our critical mineral

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,280
supply. Um and these rare earth elements

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,760
are essential to a lot of different

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
applications particularly relevant for

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,360
the defense and tech sectors. So what

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,520
are we doing here? Our tech stack takes

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,960
inputs such as industrial waste,

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,960
electricity and brines. And we have a

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,640
profitable autonomous and electrified

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,920
solution that converts these waste

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,119
materials into minerals, non-hazardous

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,280
waste and building materials. The way we

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:30,560
do that is we have uh a combination of

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,720
an AI ML model, an electrochemical cell

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,520
and a sequence of intensified unit

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,320
process operations. Our AI model will

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,799
help us design our flowheets smartly,

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,200
optimize our operating conditions and

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,840
run our process autonomously. Our

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,840
electrochemical cell allows us to

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,040
generate acid and base on demand

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
reducing the operational expenses and

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
splitting salt without using

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,200
electrodialysis. Our sequence of unit

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,399
operations is intensified that allows us

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,399
to deploy a plant for much lower capex

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
and much lower opex in a more lean

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,159
fashion.

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,759
Um in terms of our timeline, we are

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,640
targeting a pilot uh in early next year

48
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,720
followed by a demo scale plant in 2027

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,760
and a large scale plant in 2028.

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,680
Now you may ask why can we do this? The

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,400
simple reason that we can do this is

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,879
because sub1 billion units are

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,120
uneconomical for mining majors to

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,680
extract materials from. Um and we are

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,120
using industrial waste feed stocks and

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,120
so we can avoid uh relying on permits

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,640
because it's secondary mining. It's

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
pre-permitted

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,440
and our selective leeching allows us to

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,319
extract from lowgrade or so because of

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,040
this we can now intercept the declining

62
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,440
primary ore grades and translate this to

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,920
primary uh ores as well. This allows us

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,680
to unlock historically unavailable

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
resources.

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,400
And with this uh in terms of commercial

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,319
traction and partnerships, we are

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
seeking feed stock partners for joint

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,879
development agreement for different

70
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,280
kinds of feed stocks like coldfly ash or

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,519
redmud as examples. And we are also

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,640
looking for product offtakes for all

73
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,040
three uh comm all three product uh

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,159
families. high value off takes, medium

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,239
value takes and our uh bulk products.

76
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,239
With this uh yeah, that's all us.
