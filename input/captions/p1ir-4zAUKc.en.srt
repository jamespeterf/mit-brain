00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,720
soft robotics. It's a branch of robotics

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,520
essentially where instead of using what

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,760
people normally associate with robotics

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,160
like rigid materials, we're replacing

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,080
that instead with 3D printed soft

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,480
materials and using that to make an

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,359
actual robot. If we look at the world

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,720
around us, a lot of the biological

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,760
organisms are actually not rigid. So not

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,840
at all like what we imagine from robots.

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,320
As humans, for example, we have the soft

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,880
skin covering us and that allows us to

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,040
very easily and safely interact with the

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
world. The hope for this research and

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,040
where I think it could lead to is the

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,160
development of more soft robotic modules

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,280
with incorporated highresolution tactile

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,680
sensing that can actually perform a lot

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,039
more useful tasks and safely interact

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,800
with the world. Find your MIT moment.
