1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
Moving your life for one year is terrifying sometimes.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,506
It was terrifying to me, but I really think it is worth it.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:10,927
I really think it's a once in a lifetime 
experience and opportunity.

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:15,932
My why of being here is my whole career was in the public sector.

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:20,020
I really enjoy the feeling of giving back to my community

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,314
and to my country and affecting 
peoples’ lives for the better.

7
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,775
Knowing that you've done something good,

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,444
that you've had a good impact

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:31,322
on people's lives, that you made the world a better place, even for

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,367
a small fraction of humanity

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,745
or even a small fraction of your community.

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,788
Just know you have one year of this

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,415
and you have to make the most out of it.

14
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
Make time to make the friendships and make time to have the one-on-ones

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,172
and make time to go to the events of the programs

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,424
and the events of the schools and the events of MIT.

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,593
It is so important because 

18
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,553
those are the experiences that will stay with you after.

19
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:58,391
I have three girls and one boy.
I am super excited for them

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,519
coming to graduation
and seeing me with the MIT

21
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,439
regalia, like, in front of The Dome.

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,777
And, you know, the signals
that that gives to my girls about,

23
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,030
and to my son also, about

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,532
what it means to have a true partnership.

25
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:19,245
What it means to be a successful career woman, right.

26
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,208
That is something very vivid of a picture that will stay with them,

27
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:28,213
that I'm not sure any achievement
in my career – as an economist

28
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,756
it's really hard to explain

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,134
what I do to my kids because it's very abstract sometimes.

30
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,097
And so this is a very good visual for them to sort of

31
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,183
see of what a successful career woman is

32
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,437
and I think they will all take it with them

33
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,566
and I hope it will give a really good life lesson to them.
