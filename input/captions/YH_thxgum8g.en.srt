00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Here at the MIT research reactor, we do

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,640
research on finding new technologies

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,160
that could be used in nuclear energy in

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,880
the future. So, we're here in the

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,360
control room of the MIT research reactor

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,759
where we monitor the temperature and the

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,199
reactor power level and other parameters

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,880
to make sure that everything is running

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,119
smoothly. So, the goal of nuclear

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
engineering research is to take the heat

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,359
energy that's released from splitting

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,680
atoms and use it to make electricity

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,519
rather than using natural gas or coal

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,079
which are not as clean. We use the

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
reactor to test new materials. These new

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,160
materials that we test here could be

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
used to build stronger and safer

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,320
reactors in the future. We may have

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,800
reactors that are on land. We may have

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,559
reactors that are floating in the ocean.

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,320
We could even have reactors that are

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,320
like batteries and sitting on every

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,879
street corner. As the price of natural

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,600
gas goes up, we may be relying more on

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,079
nuclear energy for electricity.

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,239
