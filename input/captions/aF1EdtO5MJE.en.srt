1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,080
our third and final company presenting

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:09,000
is Butler Butler is offering iot

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,240
intelligence for indoor movement and

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,879
well-being uh Butler is an MIT media lab

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,960
spin out and so introducing CEO and

Deng is an award-winning innovator and

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,039
computational designer and created the

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,039
field of responsive context aware AG um

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,759
architecture among his many

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,440
accomplishments and experiences HHA is a

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,079
former researcher at City Science group

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,399
MIT media lab welcoming now hunga to

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,039
speak on

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,800
Butler thank you so much for inviting me

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,120
I'm H co-founder and CEO of Butler my

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,039
background is boosting architecture and

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,960
computer science I have my degree at

19
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,960
Harvard University for computational

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,600
design as SP the company off MIT media

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,160
lab 2019 on L with my labmate at the

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,519
media lab City Science group so since

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,159
buing isar Brad and but it's my pleasure

24
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:07,040
to introduce what we bu here at

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,119
berer our mission is to build the worst

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
most scalable privacy friendly people

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,880
sensoring platform transforming how

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,320
spaces responds to people so it's this

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,759
tiny wireless sensor insto in second

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,280
helping business to make smarter

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,079
decisions from improving operational

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,920
efficiency into life-saving use

33
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,479
cases with SP the company off on media

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,320
lab 2019 the slce used to be two rows of

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,119
PhD from both MIT and Berkeley I call

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,920
the complete nerdy marriage of the

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,759
technology we launched our V1 sensor in

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,439
2022 so three years in we become a c

39
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,640
leader in the smart building occuping

40
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,520
sensing space particularly in workplace

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,040
and we are emerging to be the leader in

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,640
house care selling

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,040
too so now it's definitely a little bit

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,439
bigger group than just my labmates we're

45
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,079
strong team of 60 plus teammates and

46
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:04,159
have offices in San Francisco Boston and

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:07,200
Tokyo bottom right and we deploy our

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,959
sensor globally uh in the past few years

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
we already deploy 207 sensors covering

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,440
40 million square feet for largest

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
Enterprises in the world you might can

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,040
recognize from the picture here some of

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,000
the top Fortune 50 campuses and we have

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,360
recently complete our first full campus

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,879
implantation for Senor living in Sweden

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,840
hamsa City for to buildings today my

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,200
presentation will cover both office use

58
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,519
cases and Senior Living use cases in the

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,760
smart Ming smart cities

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,920
environment so in the past decades it

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,080
have only been two type of sensor detect

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,040
people scale well in the CI and cities

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,000
and also buildings once the motion

64
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,640
sensor on the right it does not really

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,920
sense people any Movement Like a puppy

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,280
like tricker or during night time in the

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,519
building it turn the lights off and

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,440
leave you in the dark with the move and

69
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,680
you have to make a dance like this to

70
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,640
turn lights on and other accurate

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,599
alternative is camera on the left but

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,040
camera intrude people's privacy so no

73
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,000
one wants a future where camera camera

74
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,640
fly

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,840
everywhere so we design something right

76
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,120
set in between it has accuracy of a

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,560
camera but without privacy sensitive

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,120
information they also F out the puppy

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,519
we're the first and only sensors that

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,640
can only use surface temperature to

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,720
sense people's location body posture in

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,400
real time and wireless with multiple

83
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,120
years of battery life it's really not

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,319
eyes it's a nerve cells that that feels

85
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,519
the use of the space and understand what

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,640
users

87
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,640
need so the version of fut I believe in

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,439
with AI is spatial intelligence

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,879
buildings is the world's largest user

90
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,439
interface with six actually 7 billion da

91
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,439
active users now and finally reach their

92
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,000
potential with Anonymous user data we

93
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,920
provided we capture over 1 billion data

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,879
frame daily with with just 207 sensors

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,959
so this is just a tiny drop of water to

96
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,280
transer bons of square feet of a space

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,120
into of the word into space that can

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,400
understand individual needs from space

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,799
efficiency use cases to life saving use

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,040
cases

101
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
so our first Fe market like I mentioned

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,159
is office based this UI is a littleit

103
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,000
old but data is very representative

104
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,680
workplace managers never know there are

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,439
hundreds of leads being used through the

106
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,879
badge data this was a public company San

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,560
Francisco office and the global warpless

108
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,320
manager in Canada was very proud of

109
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,320
office design from The Bash data they

110
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,840
design for 25 people and there's 25 bass

111
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,000
STP every day so she was very proud of

112
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,720
it until she install Butler and find out

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,039
what actually happened so they do their

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,759
morning stand up and then they have

115
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:38,520
lunch and at 1: p.m. people EMP the

116
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,360
office so they were just there for the

117
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,720
free

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,720
launch that's the crew reality so the

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,000
real estate team is a small team that

120
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,919
makes hundreds of lead decision two

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,800
people team as a public company probably

122
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,639
manage 50 to 200 Lees they really need

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,880
the visibility into the this data this

124
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,360
data otherwise they might just end up

125
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,479
with 10% which is potenti

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,120
at minimum four to five leas people just

127
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,400
came in for free food and completely

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,520
wasted um off the space uh and this is a

129
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,560
few million dollars of the leads at list

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,199
um and Senior Living side might be

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,440
certain rooms that never got enough

132
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,800
resources and that's not just money but

133
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,800
people's

134
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
life so you can manage those data and

135
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,400
also see through like stock ticker you

136
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,120
can also

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,520
take the data we provided and then use

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,039
our AI Prof platform to suggest new

139
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,479
design based on the sensor data of the

140
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,880
office usage you can see even the colors

141
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,880
matching here off the rendering uh AI

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,560
suggested so we have buil many

143
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,759
integration for building controls from

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,039
Smart cleaning also to awag um to life

145
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,199
saving nurse cost system and many of the

146
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,199
building automations can lead to carbon

147
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,199
reductions

148
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,199
so in loving side of use case besides

149
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,919
body posture and location recognition

150
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,800
fall detection the most important thing

151
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:18,680
actually fall prevention is the biggest

152
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,120
uh value add so in this deployment each

153
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,280
room is covered with three sensors to

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,880
understand patient

155
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,759
movement an alert nurse when they're all

156
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,960
of bad in night time and no Motion in

157
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,880
the daytime so this is more of near real

158
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,840
time prevention features so you have a

159
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,160
few second to a minute to detect and

160
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,960
respond and prevent a a potential

161
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,759
incident we also can do daily analytics

162
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,319
number of time going to the toilet to

163
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,800
get to guide and diagnose unary tract

164
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,680
infections UTI which is a top emergency

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,880
in senior living and also lead to

166
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,560
reduction of fall if provided uh a

167
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,759
prevention early prevention to prevent

168
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,919
the UTI so you can see this specific

169
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,240
room have increasing visit off the

170
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,960
toilet you can also summarize Daily

171
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,720
Report through our customiz GPT using

172
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,720
our sensor data instead of manual

173
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,879
logging so one day when you're walking

174
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,560
into any buildings when you look up you

175
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,560
sort of see

176
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,199
berer that's all

177
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,120
my thank you so much appreciate it and

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,039
fantastic really interesting stuff

179
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,400
you're doing um you mentioned it briefly

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,160
um but would love to dive into it since

181
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,120
we have the time what the sustainability

182
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
benefit of the sensors

183
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,879
are so as I mentioned there's like a

184
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,440
dozens of integration we do with our

185
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,960
sensor data from what you're just seeing

186
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,120
a little bit the ACTA control from

187
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,479
number of users in the building to drive

188
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,680
like um turning on and off atra um this

189
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,639
wasn't a thing that could be done from

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,159
traditional motion sensor CU you cannot

191
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,159
wave a hand and control and turn on the

192
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,000
full rooftop machine so you have to Bas

193
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,520
on the trends of people which is the

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,960
definite number of people using the

195
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,360
space right and you cannot use like air

196
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,879
quality because it's aftermath usually

197
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,240
it's already like really high CO2 and

198
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,759
then like crank it up and it's not part

199
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,680
efficient at all so that's just one use

200
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,159
case we also have like smart cleaning if

201
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,159
you nobody is using um the the toilet uh

202
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:27,639
there's both spectr sometime in the in

203
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,520
the airport you see really really dirty

204
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,240
like toilet right you see those tablet

205
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,519
you have to like say really really

206
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,519
unhappy with that and someone came in

207
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,159
but like through like usage data you can

208
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,080
also Drive smart cleaning automatically

209
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
and in a lot of cases nobody was using

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
it and then they were regular cleaning

211
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,120
this is also operational efficiency uh

212
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,959
Improvement and also operation cabin U

213
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,480
reduction in terms of operating the

214
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,399
buildings and then respectively uh so

215
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,880
from

216
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,480
utilizing just the sensor data for Real

217
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,240
Estate footprint planning you can reduce

218
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:07,600
use um six tens of CO2 per employee to

219
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,440
roughly like a 2 uh 2.51 like which I

220
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,519
just showed just now and then like from

221
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,839
at control we can reduce another 0.3

222
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,839
tens of CO2 per employee we have a paper

223
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,399
around it and also one a word like uh

224
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,079
was uh in the recent competition from

225
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,000
word economic Forum in San Francisco wow

226
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,240
well congratulations for that and I can

227
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,880
definitely see how the recog was well

228
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,680
deserved um well thank you hunga really

229
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,079
appreciate you joining us today and to

230
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,200
all the companies that presented um as

231
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:43,760
part of MIT startup lightning talks

232
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,839
today now I'd like to turn it back to

233
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,920
