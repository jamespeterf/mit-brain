00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:03,870
(Upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,720
- [Narrator] When you look at
this image, what do you see?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,640
You may think it's a moving image,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,700
but it's actually a
single continuous picture.

5
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:20,685
to spruce up things like
artwork, ads, and decor.

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:23,205
Barrier-grid animations
turn everyday objects

7
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:27,225
into visually engaging
displays without electronics,

8
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:30,319
but this galloping horse isn't your average animation.

9
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:35,124
It's a bold new design created
by MIT CSAIL researchers.

10
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:38,931
Your standard animation
overlay resembles a picket fence

11
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:40,611
with a straight line pattern.

12
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:41,841
This conventional design

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,671
has been much more
straightforward to produce

14
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,581
than say, zig-zag patterns.

15
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:49,371
That is, until FabObscura enabled users

16
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:51,501
to think outside the box.

17
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,384
Now, you can explore uncharted
barrier-grid animations.

18
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,421
The program allows you to create

19
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:01,678
a sheet called a barrier or a grid,

20
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:05,338
and the underlying image
you slide that grid across.

21
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:07,858
The picture is a mashup
of different frames

22
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,328
from an animation,

23
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:13,108
sliced and interwoven to
present different snapshots

24
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,998
depending on where you place the overlay.

25
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:17,518
From wavy designs to circular patterns,

26
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:21,238
the team's FabObscura
software turns unique concepts

27
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,127
helping users add dynamic animations

28
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,710
to things like pictures, toys, and decor.

29
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,637
To create a barrier-grid
display with FabObscura,

30
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:33,467
you first upload a series of images,

31
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,387
like a few frames of a car moving,

32
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,790
or choose a preset like
a blinking eyeball.

33
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:42,047
FabObscura splices these
frames into one image for you.

34
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,847
You then type in mathematical functions

35
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:47,207
that graph out the shape and
movement of a barrier pattern.

36
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,537
For example, a wavy
barrier is a sine function,

37
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:53,807
curving up and down like a
series of hills and valleys.

38
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,287
By boiling down overlay
designs to math equations,

39
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,967
FabObscura allows you to tinker

40
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,817
with a variety of creative animations.

41
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,407
You can preview your design,

42
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:05,117
then fabricate the barrier and picture

43
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:07,457
onto separate transparent sheets

44
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:11,180
or print the image on paper
Using a standard 2D printer.

45
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,397
Your image can then be placed

46
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,647
and secured on flat handheld items

47
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:17,777
typically found in
homes and office spaces,

48
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:19,460
such as clocks and jars.

49
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:23,597
Artists, including graphic
designers and printmakers,

50
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:25,607
could also use FabObscura

51
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:28,007
to make eye-catching animated displays

52
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:30,077
without needing to connect any wires.

53
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:32,387
The tool could also help
create adjustable signs

54
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:35,867
in places like zoos,
construction sites, or stores

55
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:37,937
where you may need a
display to notify visitors

56
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:41,180
about closed off areas or
machines that are under repair.

57
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:47,453
called nested animations.

58
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:49,283
Depending on how you move the barrier,

59
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:50,933
you'll see different scenes.

60
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,706
They're layered clever designs.

61
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:55,943
While innovative, the researchers caution

62
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:59,573
that users should upload fewer
frames for nested animations

63
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,213
to keep the interlaced image simple.

64
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:04,463
They also suggest using
high contrast images

65
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:05,936
for a crisper presentation.

66
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:10,973
In the future, users could
upload videos to FabObscura

67
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,493
instead of sending individual frames.

68
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,313
The system might also
step into the 3D world,

69
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:19,373
expanding beyond the 2D handheld surfaces

70
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,293
to create barrier-grid animations

71
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:24,443
on larger, more complex objects.

72
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:27,743
From simple printouts
to mesmerizing motion,

73
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:29,483
FabObscura proves that sometimes

74
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:31,793
the most captivating technology

75
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:34,016
doesn't need a single wire or battery.
