1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,640
good afternoon

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,880
everyone good afternoon

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,559
everyone all right well clearly we need

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,120
to be serving better coffee in the uh in

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,480
the lobby to our our friends at ILP um

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,760
really excited to be with you this

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,199
afternoon and to um engage in this panel

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,400
um a lot of the talks that you've been

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,480
hearing today have been exploring the

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,000
technical aspects of sustainability how

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,359
can we improve the technical

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,519
characteristics of our manufacturing

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,840
processes our mining processes

14
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,000
um some of the critical things that

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,480
drive the environmental footprint that

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,559
they were all so concerned about um and

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,600
I loved the last question in the in the

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,160
last session about what will it take to

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,760
get some of these ideas from the lab

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,120
bench to commercial feasibility and

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
Commercial scale so that's really going

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,120
to be the emphasis of what we're talking

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
about in this session is the business of

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,840
sustainability how can we create

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,000
solutions that that for which there's a

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,840
strong business case where we can align

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,879
the profitability of our Enterprises

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,640
with tackling these big social and

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,439
environmental challenges that's the

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,040
center central question of our work at

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,640
the MIT St sustainability initiative um

32
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,759
and it's going to be the focus of our

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,439
conversation um and to do that we've got

34
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,920
a really cool um fireside chat that

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,000
we've planned and I'll welcome Demitrius

36
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,280
and mahes to the stage um and what the

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,200
the design of this is that we have a um

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,280
both an industrial company and a

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,040
financial company um to get in in to get

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,000
us into this topic of the business case

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,520
the financial case for sustainability

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,840
and what we're going to do is dig into

43
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,360
the questions about um how can what what

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,920
is the current state of play in terms of

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
the business case for sustainability

46
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,600
which are the projects that are getting

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:55,560
us a positive Roi in both financial and

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,600
um and impact terms and what can the

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,159
capital markets and investors who are

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
seeking that kind of return what role

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,479
can they play in helping to make these

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
Solutions work um so welcome to the

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,840
stage uh Demetrius and mahes thank you

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,200
so much both of you for being here thank

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,720

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,080
I'm just going to ask you both to just

57
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,400
in give us a little sense of who you are

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,720
where you sit what uh what's the purview

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,400
of your work okay thank you

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,319
everyone and so my name Dimitri Bonos

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,680
I'm the Chief Information and Innovation

62
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,560
officer of for real public TR company in

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
the naspac Netherland in Spain we are a

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
global infrastructure player with

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
different capabilities covering the

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,319
overall value chain of the

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,239
infrastructure development from the

68
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,360
Inception of an early design that could

69
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,159
be approach with the needs of a

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,040
community of an state or a country to

71
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,560
the design Finance construction and

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,319
operation of large type of Assets in

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,319
particular airports we have been doing

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,560
decades in charge of hro we are right

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,080
now H investing um remodeling the new

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,440
terminal one in in in in JFK highways

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,440
all across the the world and energy and

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,120
transversally we have the construction

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,080
capability in order to interoperate all

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,400
those asset we are expanding towards all

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,120
the continents and putting a lot of

82
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,799
focus in us where many of the large

83
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,440
asset that you are um interacting as

84
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,400
user um are potentially developed by us

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,239
including data center during the last 10

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,519
10 years oh data centers yeah data

87
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,239
center people may not have thought about

88
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,040
Federal as being involved in that kind

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
of infrastruct digital infrastructure we

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,400
have leveraged that value chain from the

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,080
construction we have been building data

92
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,080
center for many clients including the

93
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,080
hypercal and right now what we are

94
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,280
putting in common all the pieces with a

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,280
wider perspective than trying to

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,159
introduce many of what we have commented

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,519
today know how to expand the life or

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,959
repurpose an existing data center

99
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,439
introducing Effectiveness in all the

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,280
steps in the value chain from the energy

101
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,920
regeneration from the pure operation

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,920
from the adoption of a digital schin

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,599
that is allowing us to simulate

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,840
different scenarios without affecting

105
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439
the real environment and data center is

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,040
an amazing playground in order to put in

107
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,120
value all those capabilities okay so and

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,239
and Ferro is involved in design build

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,160
operate of all these different kinds of

110
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,520
infrastructures you just and finance an

111
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,680
important piece because at the very

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,919
early stage um to finance required to

113
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,240
the risk all the potential

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,919
um unknown situation mainly with a 30 40

115
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,800
50 years many occasions um typically the

116
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
resiliency of a physical asset is not

117
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,560
allowing to adapt to the evolution of

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
technological changes of the innovation

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,440
no how to introduce some Factor when you

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,120
are running the business case under the

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,479
affection of the um policy at that

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,440
moment is is is implying and trying to

123
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,919
foresight what would be the evolution of

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,479
technology in order to intr use properly

125
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,000
in the business case it's really

126
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,520
relevant no if you are not completely

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,080
sure to make the infrastructure

128
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
resilient enough in order to be

129
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,600
adaptable without the necessity to

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,440
introduce more CeX it's also an

131
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,080
important piece that we should introduce

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,160
as much as possible and we are trying to

133
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,479
make resilient H infrastructure able to

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,400
be prepared and ready to adapt new

135
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,000
technologies along the life the lifetime

136
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,800
great thank you uh mahes you want to

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
give us some coordinates no absolutely

138
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
and I'm glad it's I love the fact that

139
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,840
Jay tried to wake you up so I know we're

140
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,919
one session away from drinks so bear

141
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
with us and thank you for hanging in

142
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,919
there I know it's been a long day but a

143
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,880
fascinating day um uh my name is mahes

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,000
jumar I head up uh fixed income

145
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,600
sustainability research for a company

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,160
called MFS uh Investment Management

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,240
Massachusetts Financial Services we're

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,960
celebrating our 100 Years and we're

149
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,080
right across the river um you can

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,520
literally see our building from MIT

151
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,319
which is very cool and um I'm also glad

152
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,720
to be back at my alma model so it's

153
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,880
really nice to be back in these hallowed

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,240
grounds and listening to all the

155
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,680
professors and and the postdocs and and

156
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,560
graduate students talk about some of the

157
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,800
cool research that they're doing so when

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,400
when I listened to the talks today it

159
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,319
was interesting when I just I know I

160
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,280
purposely brought the programming and

161
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,039
all the panels and what was fascinating

162
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,759
to me was these are probably the same

163
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,360
conversations that we are having with

164
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,680
our invested companies be it if we own

165
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,599
the stock of these companies like we own

166
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,440
stock in foval for example it's a public

167
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,720
company um or the bonds of these

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,160
companies because we provide financing

169
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,080
and what was interesting is when I think

170
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,560
about all these themes in terms of

171
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,400
Transportation hydrogen nuclear um

172
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,560
decarbonizing transport it's uh sorry

173
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,000
Trucking it's fascinating right this is

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,599
the academic side of the commercial

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
slide as Jay rightly pointed out um uh

176
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,080
what is interesting to us is where as a

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,919
mainstream asset manager

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,520
we're not necessarily um you can imagine

179
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,879
a VC or a PE that's trying to fund early

180
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,160
these sorts of commercial relation at a

181
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,840
very early mezzanine stage but we

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,720
certainly buy um um uh equities and

183
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,280
fixed income once these companies are

184
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,919
either private and issue bonds are able

185
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,120
to do so in a commercial scale you can

186
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,919
imagine this the typically the smallest

187
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,560
Bond size that a company should uh can

188
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,039
issue that we can buy is roughly in the

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,000
order of $300 million that's much bigger

190
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,800
than an a average round AN a b or c

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,639
round that you might see that one of you

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039
needs to get this technology off the

193
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,120
ground but nevertheless asset managers

194
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,160
like us play an extremely important role

195
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,479
in providing capital in the form of debt

196
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,039
and Equity financing to ensure that

197
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,280
companies can can raise the funding

198
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,000
needed to commercialize everything we're

199
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,680
learning about today so um we play one

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,599
small part of that as a public asset

201
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,120
manager yeah yeah I mean in a way if if

202
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,960
we think about you know the MIT startup

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
exchange is part of the mix of today's

204
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,319
event right and over in the Next Room

205
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,000
we've got a few startups here um and so

206
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,440
we could I I often think of it sort of

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,919
like a three-legged stool right which is

208
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,599
that you need the technologies that are

209
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,120
coming out of those startups um most of

210
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,400
those Technologies are B2B right so you

211
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,039
need the customers for those

212
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,240
technologies that are going to provide

213
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,240
the advanced purchase commitments and so

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,840
on that are going to get them off the

215
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,120
ground and that means um serious climate

216
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,479
and sustainability equipments by big

217
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,440
companies who are going to be their

218
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,560
customers um and then the Third Leg of

219
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,760
the stool is the financing which as you

220
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,440
said um I I like how you put that that

221
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,760
that there's um part of that is the is

222
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,680
the risk Capital that's needed to lift

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,000
the startups off the ground but there's

224
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,440
also the capital and the influence of

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,560
capital over the incumbent companies to

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,279
help them um along along the journey um

227
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,200
so and you're you're not an impact

228
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,560
investor right MFS is a traditional

229
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,839
financial institution you're helping

230
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,000
Pension funds make sure they're going to

231
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,600
get their long-term obligations met um

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,399
so you're really looking for a financial

233
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,240
return so what is the space right now of

234
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,320
profitable sustainability work right I

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,560
think that's that's sort of the question

236
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,240
that's on our minds and federal I mean

237
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,560
you this is one particular window but

238
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,200
where are you finding in the projects

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,959
that you do that there is the tightest

240
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,800
alignment between the the financial

241
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,920
business case let's say and the the

242
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
sustainability objectives there are many

243
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,600
bar that have the target of the

244
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,399
carbonization in 20 30 years and we are

245
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,200
seeing the opportunity wi of acting as

246
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,680
enabler and catalyzer of that transition

247
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,440
for example Energy Efficiency different

248
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,800
type of asset the adoption of new

249
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,279
mechanism at a scale to decarbonize a

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,360
bitumin plant could convert that plant

251
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,399
and extend the life spam another 20

252
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,440
years being more efficient reducing

253
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,480
dramatically the conception of um

254
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,560
nonrenewable fuels and at the same time

255
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,200
creating a reference that the side

256
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,040
effect of the heat could be used for

257
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,320
another collateral industry that was not

258
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,000
in that Industrial Area no to approach

259
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,959
with that view in front of a problem is

260
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,959
raising the opportunities for a

261
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,120
profitable business for example to

262
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,240
manage an orchestrate at the scale the

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,959
the street lighting of a big city MH

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,120
it's a demand it's a public need but if

265
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,480
Beyond the adoption of L that is

266
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,040
something massively implanted we are

267
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,320
adopting um AI in order to simulate and

268
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:46,160
to adapt with the support of iot um

269
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,920
localize small um Edge servers how to

270
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,320
adapt in a more seamless way you are

271
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,120
creating an efficiency that is reverting

272
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,120
to the city itself and it is becoming a

273
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,720
business where we need to incorporate as

274
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,079
much as possible H technology that could

275
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,240
improve that no so there are so in both

276
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,200
of those examples the bitchman plant

277
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,560
that's making the materials for our

278
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,839
roads and the street lights right in

279
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,760
both of those situations the business

280
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,200
cases I'm going to save energy I'm going

281
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,760
to save money um which is maybe kind of

282
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,959
the oldest business case in the book for

283
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,240
sustainability efforts and what I'm

284
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,760
hearing you say is that there's a NE the

285
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,639
current gener because we were talking

286
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,560
about that since 2005 right um but the

287
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,120
next generation of that is the

288
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,160
application of iot and AI to identify

289
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,160
those opportunities and kind of get to

290
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,000
the at is the the new trend is is

291
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,120
improving incrementally the efficiency

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,519
of what we were doing for for years or

293
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,240
for decades there is another example in

294
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,839
the early stage definition of new

295
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,920
materials and if we are able to deploy

296
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,040
in the concrete base or in the pavement

297
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,079
of a big road and a specific type of

298
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,639
material that is able to self heal or

299
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,680
it's able to reduce the friction with

300
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,120
the roads or even to to improve the way

301
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,440
of the the the road um are managed

302
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,240
during the winter with the perspective

303
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,880
of the overall lifespan of that road we

304
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,120
are reducing dramatically the Opex so we

305
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,600
are introducing in the design specific

306
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,760
materials or capabilities to improve the

307
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,160
longevity the longevity at the same time

308
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,600
reduce the carbon footprint and in one

309
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
case in the scope two but if we are

310
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,160
talking about the cars and the

311
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,800
consumtion of of the cars um that is

312
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,600
directly connected with the with a scope

313
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,320
three um so let me so let's explore this

314
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,720
example so this is you're saying that

315
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,279
there are um changes to the material

316
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,320
properties of the concrete and Roads

317
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,000
that can improve their longevity and

318
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,800
therefore we don't need to do as much

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,079
repair replacement of the materials and

320
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,240
therefore we can reduce the footprint of

321
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,199
the whole thing yep um and so we can see

322
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,399
how we can save that money in Opex over

323
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,639
time is there a higher first cost for

324
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,680
that material than the default like is

325
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,480
it a more expensive material to

326
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
implement in the beginning that that's

327
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,079
the the the situation that we need to

328
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,920
compound with

329
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,920
a lifetime perspective no in our case we

330
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,199
have the advantage that the

331
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,360
externalities of a potential higher cost

332
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,680
is introduced in the overall business

333
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,360
case and through the financing of

334
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,839
factors like the one he represent we are

335
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,639
able to pay potentially an extra at the

336
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,639
beginning but be sure that that is going

337
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,399
to be beneficial H to us to the scope

338
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,320
three of the drivers that are going to

339
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,760
consume less in their own Vehicles

340
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,360
probably it's going to generate less

341
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,760
noise and that's going to have a

342
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,320
positive impact in the areas where we

343
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,360
are deploying the infrastructure and at

344
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,279
the end those externalities are very

345
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,480
important to be but if they're

346
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,680
externalities they're hard to capture in

347
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,600
the business case right so if I'm if I'm

348
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,639
running I get like if I'm a city and I'm

349
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,240
running the roads and I don't have to do

350
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,000
as much Road repair I'm going to save

351
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
that money on my balance sheet of course

352
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,079
but if the drivers on those roads are

353
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,839
saving fuel because the road is more

354
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,519
efficient to drive on they're getting to

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,399
save that money it's not necessarily AC

356
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,199
crewing to me um so that's doesn't that

357
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,759
sort of weaken the business case for the

358
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,560
city manager who's doing the deployment

359
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,160
of that technology no but at the end we

360
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,279
have the responsibility also to

361
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,680
progressively reduce the scope three and

362
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,279
externalities and every time we are

363
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,680
deploying any piece of infrastructure

364
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,839
with that commitment in terms of the

365
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,600
sustainability of the overall life cycle

366
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,000
1% could be in standard basis the CO2

367
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,880
generation during the construction and

368
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,320
we are reducing systematically with many

369
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,800
Technologies the rest 99% is directly

370
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,160
connected with the maintenance operation

371
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,639
but basically is the consumption of the

372
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
cars and assuming that we are going to

373
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,759
progressively balance the combustion

374
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,560
with the electric to introduce during

375
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,519
the process measures that will reduce

376
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,519
the Opex but at the same time we have an

377
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,399
advantage for the future users yes I

378
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,440
think is the three as that we are trying

379
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,920
to combine yeah right right just so so

380
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,240
if I just put this question to the

381
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,279
audience for a second how many of you

382
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,759
have seen projects where that have this

383
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,120
characteristic where there's a higher

384
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,959
first cost but it's going to pay itself

385
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,160
off over time if I really were able to

386
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,440
do life cycle costing it would make

387
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,720
sense but sometimes it's hard to get

388
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,320
that initial first cost done just raise

389
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,279
your hand if you've seen projects that

390
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,680
are have that characteristic okay um so

391
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,279
that that's essentially a um a finance

392
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,120
problem right because I want to shift uh

393
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,759
money over time that's like your whole

394
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,440
business right so how can

395
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,240
the investors how can financial

396
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,720
institutions support faster adoption of

397
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,600
this kind of approach that's a great

398
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,279
question I and if you followed um what

399
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,680
Demetrius just said there were some

400
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,720
important things to pick up on that he

401
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,639
talked about capex upfront investment he

402
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,639
talked about Opex you know continuous uh

403
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,519
maintenance if you will and Savings in

404
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,399
terms of costs as well as Savings in

405
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:00,040
terms of carbon right scope two and

406
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,199
scope three so scope one as a company is

407
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,920
what um I generate from my own

408
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,440
operations scope two is emissions

409
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,920
associated with power and energy use and

410
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,000
scope three is is emissions associated

411
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,199
with product use and and everything else

412
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,800
in the value chain so when you think

413
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,000
about that and and Jason asked so what

414
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,240
do I need to do to give you the

415
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,279
necessary capex the large payment

416
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,560
upfront that will hopefully pay for

417
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,040
itself it's that's exactly what a bond

418
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,519
is Right which is exactly why fixed

419
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,319
income financing drives the world world

420
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,560
I tease somebody I I was telling

421
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,360
somebody that especially in United

422
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,000
States I live in a town six miles from

423
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,800
here I take the train I have water in my

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,839
faucet everything happens because of

425
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,440
bonds life happens because of bonds both

426
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,880
at a company level and at a city level

427
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,759
and a county and state level so that's

428
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,959
exactly why this world of ESG themed

429
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,440
financing came about in back in 2007

430
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,120
2008 was this concept of green bonds

431
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,959
which is you can issue a green Bond and

432
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,720
show the investors exactly what you're

433
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:07,319
going to do with the use of proceeds um

434
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,720
we provide The Upfront financing and

435
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,760
then they pay the coupon over the life

436
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,360
of the project back to the fixed income

437
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,240
um investors so that's the whole idea

438
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,600
and that's why there's so much talk

439
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,240
about scaling up um transition Finance

440
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,000
climate lending using the bond markets

441
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,360
and using a combination of Green Loans

442
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,360
green bonds sustainable bonds Etc and

443
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,559
it's exact the heart of what a very

444
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,440
practical problem that fovel has and

445
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,600
what Jason just described but butes how

446
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,200
are we doing with green bonds and

447
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,200
sustainability linked bonds right

448
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,080
because I feel like you know there's

449
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,799
that famous drawing of the hype cycle

450
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,480
right where it's like things get hyped

451
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,919
and then you sort of then then they kind

452
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,200
of we find out that there's they're not

453
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,720
as big or effective as we thought they

454
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
were so the hype cycle goes down and

455
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,200
then there's this kind of increasing

456
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,280
ramp where we then actually sort it out

457
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,799
and get it to work so with green bonds

458
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,840
and sustainability link bonds where are

459
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,720
we in that hype cycle a it's a good

460
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,799
question I mean so if you look at the

461
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,000
cumulative size of the ESG I call the

462
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,200
ESG theme bond market right that's green

463
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,400
bonds social bonds sustainable bonds and

464
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,120
something called sustainability linked

465
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,039
bonds right and there's a little bit of

466
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,280
differences in each one of them um that

467
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,159
if you look at the total cumulative

468
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,919
issuance of that those four types of

469
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,919
bonds over the past 10 years roughly or

470
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,280
even 15 it's roughly at about $4

471
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,280
trillion worth of outstanding right $4

472
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,200
trillion of cumulative issuance if you

473
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,760
consider 2021 as PSG CU everything went

474
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,559
downhill after that and and if you use

475
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,600
that as your barometer of ptsg that year

476
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,840
we had close to a trillion and a half in

477
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,799
issuance so that's a high Watermark if

478
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,360
you will last year we had about 850

479
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,320
billion is in in ESG themed issuance and

480
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,840
I think we've kind of hit steady state

481
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,200
you know so it cut in half yeah and now

482
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,120
so that that that's a pretty good graph

483
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,320
of that hypee cycle right absolutely now

484
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,919
if you think you you think the

485
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,520
subsequent years are going to sort of be

486
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,000
in a similar trajectory I think the if

487
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,080
you look at estimates from from the cell

488
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,520
side as well as Nos and think tanks um

489
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,320
you will roughly see that the the

490
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,720
cumulative is I mean the annual issuance

491
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,919
is going to probably settle at a

492
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,840
trillion just slightly above a trillion

493
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,840
which makes sense because that's the the

494
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,840
ability to absorb the market now what if

495
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,120
you go talk to the policy makers they

496
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,880
want that trillion to ramp up even more

497
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,600
yes right because depending on what

498
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,320
estimate you look at you need 300

499
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,000
trillion through 2050 for the transition

500
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,760
MH you can look at McKenzie's estimate

501
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,720
World economic Forum any of these

502
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,159
estimates regardless of what number it's

503
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,960
trillions of dollars over the next 10 20

504
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:51,200
30 40 years and so the call has always

505
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,960
been can we ramp up these sorts of ESG

506
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,440
issuance in order to meet that need if

507
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,919
you assume that Equity markets are

508
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,320
tapped out and flat or um what the C's

509
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,240
and PS are doing in terms of the

510
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,760
capacity now the one new innovation in

511
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,520
the markets in the financial markets

512
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,080
that is changing this is this concept of

513
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,840
private credit of of those of you in

514
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,520
finance have seen the rise of private

515
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,559
credit funds in private credit um that

516
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,799
are riskier than conventional fixed

517
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,840
income uh it's direct lending uh direct

518
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,799
fixed income lending to an Enterprise

519
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,440
typically small companies small

520
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,679
companies in certain sectors so and the

521
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,280
private credit Market has also grown

522
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,000
roughly to a trillion and a half and the

523
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,360
the idea not sustainability link just

524
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
general in general exactly and the idea

525
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,919
there is that the blackstones of the

526
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,799
world and the Apollos of the world and

527
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,600
Aries capitals of the world who run that

528
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,679
market are also very well suited as

529
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
infrastructure investors to help with

530
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,799
the transition so my hope is that plus

531
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,080
the green Bond plus normal financing and

532
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,679
we're talking about costs of capital

533
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,679
that are 4% 8% like where where what

534
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:01,559
zone are we in here the 7% 6 to 8% like

535
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,640
you said and and is 6 to 8% um cost of

536
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,240
capital does that get you in in a

537
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,320
ferrovial project does that cost of

538
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,880
capital get you to where you want to go

539
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
in terms of being able to implement the

540
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,080
sustainable technologies that we were

541
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,679
talking about earlier so we have been

542
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,240
recurrently very high demanding in the

543
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,080
return that we are giving back to our

544
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,799
investor no even before being public

545
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,000
here in in the NASA during the last 10

546
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,880
years where currently we have been

547
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,760
giving back an average around 11% of

548
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,279
higher r so we're putting our own Equity

549
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,080
that is giving us in the game we are

550
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,600
obviously using those instruments we are

551
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,039
approaching the projects in a moment

552
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,039
where typically there is a very high

553
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,279
risk there is risk of demand risk of the

554
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,960
construction risk of the technology that

555
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,200
we are using there are few probably

556
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,400
companies that are compounding all those

557
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,440
factors and that's the reason we are

558
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,400
introducing our our Equity bringing to

559
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,679
the market certainty in those dimensions

560
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,039
and when Al the construction has been

561
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,320
finished and we are operating that asset

562
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,799
there are other instruments more

563
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,000
standard less volatile and super

564
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:13,000
structure conceiving and incorporating

565
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,919
in the taxonomy more and more those ESG

566
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,799
type of characteristic and that's the

567
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,520
moment where we are opening the

568
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:24,640
description explaining in in in detail

569
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:27,520
and managing the asset for 40 50 70

570
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,720
years I mean this topic of risk taking

571
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,159
in infrastructure is absolutely critical

572
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,279
right because a lot of these

573
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,919
technologies that we might be excited

574
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,440
about in this room um run into a huge

575
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,520
wall which is the risk aversion of

576
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,919
established companies established uh you

577
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,400
know the infrastructure projects so do

578
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,440
you feel like Federal relative to other

579
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,120
um infrastructure providers is able to

580
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,720
take more of that technology risk let me

581
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,640
give you um one short answer coming to

582
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,520
to our origin the name of the company

583
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,600
very difficult to be pronounced probably

584
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:05,159
in English ferial double a um is

585
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,279
connected with a um pivotal moment no at

586
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,120
the beginning of our our birth 72 years

587
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,799
ago we took an

588
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,120
IP um in order to accelerate the

589
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,600
construction of rail track and we were

590
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,559
able to build from outside Madrid to

591
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,360
Madrid 30 kilometers in 30 Days 1

592
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:28,679
kilometer per day 72 kilo years ago no

593
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,840
translated to nowadays if we want to

594
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,360
assess and manage the risk we need to

595
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,720
use technology we need to use data and

596
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,400
we need to digitalize the infrastructure

597
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,200
iify the infrastructure H simulate all

598
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,360
the scenarios and that is reducing

599
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,720
potentially kind of a digital twin type

600
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,600
of digital twins sensorized but even

601
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,480
during the design stage no so that risk

602
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,760
has to be modeled has to be compound and

603
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,559
has to be taken in in in consideration

604
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,159
and this is one of our strength we are

605
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,080
much more eager to to introduce new

606
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,640
technologies we need to understand that

607
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,960
the regulatory framework the insurance

608
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,360
Market many other externality that have

609
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,120
to be compound inside of the equation

610
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,159
have to also be adapted to the necessity

611
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,200
know we were talking before about

612
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,279
modifying the boundary conditions of how

613
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,600
we transmit energy in the middle of

614
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,400
amazonas or the desert of atakama it

615
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:27,399
will be ideal to introduce something

616
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,240
reducing the cost and being and CO2 more

617
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:32,760
efficient no but do we have the right

618
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,679
the right environment in order to digest

619
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,960
independently of the risk yes that

620
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,760
pivotal change so that so that business

621
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,679
case depends on the ability the

622
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,360
availability of the insurance the policy

623
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:46,520
incentives and the insurance the

624
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,159
regory market the legal framework in our

625
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,120
case being Global there is a lot of

626
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,799
asymmetry between the the policies in

627
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,520
Europe against us and in the state level

628
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,720
no and to approach at a global scale

629
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,520
with a novel technology trying to create

630
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,960
synergies many occasion is blocked

631
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,080
because the lack of yes consistency of

632
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,799
the policies across different areas we

633
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:16,080
are using in in several domains the more

634
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,720
I would say proactive policy structure

635
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,279
in order to make test validate put the

636
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,799
signature as an industrial partner to

637
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,120
reinforce The credibility of one

638
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,480
technology and from there try to

639
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,720
reinforce scale H yes scenarios to

640
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,480
deploy a technology and to convert it in

641
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,279
the bre and B got it um just a quick

642
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,000
reminder for the audience to um use the

643
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,960
QR code to pose any questions and those

644
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,399
will start to feed up here for us so we

645
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,640
can um begin to um make sure we we we we

646
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:51,200
get what's on your minds

647
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,360
um this challenge about um having the

648
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,039
right supportive policy environment and

649
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,440
having consistent policy environments to

650
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,279
do that um this is a recurring theme

651
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,240
right and and part of what it means is

652
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:06,279
that um firms need to have both a market

653
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,240
strategy for getting their um projects

654
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:10,720
and products to Market but also a

655
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,200
non-market strategy meaning the ability

656
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,600
to engage with policy makers to help set

657
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,480
rules of the game that are going to make

658
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,200
it possible um to get things out out out

659
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,679
into the world and so if we think about

660
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,279
that three-legged three legs of the

661
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,200
stool like that I was mentioning before

662
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:28,960
the startups the companies the investors

663
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,080
those are sitting on a platform which is

664
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,279
the the the the operating environment

665
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:37,399
that that supports it and um what what

666
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,520
are we do that that that policy

667
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,679
environment has itself been volatile

668
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,000
right um like you said mahes we had to

669
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,399
Peak ESG in 2021 there's been these

670
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
backlashes we feel like obviously we

671
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,919
have in in the US we have an election

672
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,919
coming up in a couple of weeks um which

673
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,600
do you what do you think um what's your

674
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,640
sense of which of the currents are going

675
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,720
to stay flowing in the right direction

676
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,120
to support this kind of um sustainable

677
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,399
infrastructure and sustainable business

678
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,840
and where do we feel like there's noise

679
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:08,760
and headwinds that are getting in our

680
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,200
way it's it's a good question and I mean

681
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,520
if you think about the cycle the virtual

682
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,559
cycle of where where a company such as

683
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,080
fovial and we're an investor a public

684
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:20,919
asset manager such as us fit in the

685
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,480
equation the idea the rate of the idea

686
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,240
with this is the following right that

687
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,240
government sets policy in terms of hey

688
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,000
we need more financing towards the

689
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,840
transition how do we do that so they set

690
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,320
the policy the incentives the

691
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,440
Partnerships to get that going they then

692
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,760
set the regulatory bodies then set

693
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,640
disclosure mechanisms to say how is a

694
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,519
company um thinking about Technologies

695
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,120
sustainability in their strategy etc etc

696
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,320
so there standard bodies such as the

697
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,519
issb for example that's quickly becoming

698
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,360
um was the they subsumed what was known

699
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,480
as a sby the sustainab Accounting

700
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,600
Standards Board in order to in order for

701
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,159
companies to disclose their

702
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,440
sustainability mission in a in a

703
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,559
standard format which then investors

704
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,360
like us can use and then the idea is

705
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:12,919
that we then are able to channel and

706
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:16,360
show our end investors what kind of

707
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,720
sustainable Investments we have um using

708
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,399
regulation at a fund level for example

709
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,640
or or a vehicle level and then the idea

710
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,279
is that that increases transparency to

711
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,120
end users who say Okay I want to give my

712
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,360
money to this financing vehicle because

713
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,279
because they're helping fund the ferals

714
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,320
of the world and that virtuous cycle

715
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,279
then takes off and hopefully all of a

716
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,760
sudden you have Capital shifting to help

717
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:41,399
the transition that's what that's what

718
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,440
governments and Regulators want now what

719
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:46,240
happens is each of those parts of the

720
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,279
value chain has Kinks right regulation

721
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,000
can be extremely burdensome to the point

722
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:54,600
where there's a lack of clarity or it's

723
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,039
very dispersed across geographies um the

724
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,440
I always tell this I I God bless the

725
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,159
Europeans in the EU they're so far ahead

726
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,240
of Regulation when it comes to

727
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,720
sustainability but depending on who you

728
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,880
are it can also seem very honorous right

729
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,440
in terms of what your obligation is as a

730
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,720
fund manager for example well there's a

731
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,120
backlash even inside the EU right now

732
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,039
around some of it's globally you're

733
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,679
right um and then and then you mentioned

734
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,720
the word taxonomy and and a taxonomy in

735
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,320
the sustainability world is nothing but

736
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,240
helping investors basically disclose

737
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,919
which of the companies they own in their

738
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,720
financial portfolio

739
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,679
are indeed sustainable or doing

740
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,559
something from a sustainab perspective

741
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:37,840
so the big the big barrier there is

742
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,360
basically too much disclosure you know

743
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,679
or inadequate disclosure it's like

744
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,799
extremes right it's like how do you

745
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,720
clean what is required and then finally

746
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:48,600
we have to as asset managers satisfy the

747
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,159
needs of the regulator in terms of what

748
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,320
we're doing that we're not committing

749
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,760
greenwashing and claiming that we're um

750
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,320
we're greener than we are on the one

751
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,360
side on the other hand being transparent

752
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,240
in terms of hey this is why we funded

753
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,440
Ferro and this is why we include fer in

754
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,000
our portfolio so each parts of the value

755
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,799
chain that I talked about in terms of

756
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
how to drive transition financing you

757
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,799
know has needs to be improved and that's

758
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,240
exactly what if you go to sustainability

759
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,000
conferences for those of you who were in

760
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,159
The Pri the principles for responsible

761
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,679
investing conference just two weeks ago

762
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,640
in Toronto that's exactly what the

763
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,159
conversation was about asset managers

764
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,399
who depend on raising assets from asset

765
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,600
owners the big Pension funds how can

766
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,679
they each work to work with each other

767
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,960
using good regulation using good

768
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,760
disclosure to basically fund the

769
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,960
transition that's the that's the topic

770
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,320
dour yeah but the but the policy

771
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,960
environment isn't just about the

772
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,000
disclosure it's also just about direct

773
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,039
incentives right whether that's the um

774
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,240
subsidy the carrot approach of the

775
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,720
inflation reduction act or the stick

776
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,760
approach of a carbon price the adoption

777
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,240
of new technology that requires a m

778
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,279
stage in order to validate that good

779
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,679
scale no yeah that's important because

780
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,760
when we need to

781
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:12,039
anticipate five six seven years before

782
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,679
the production of the new asset

783
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,960
something that probably is not under the

784
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,120
right which me you have to be able to

785
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,440
predict what that policy environment is

786
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,760
going to be and and in the volatility of

787
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,919
politics right that means being able to

788
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,240
have things that are what does that mean

789
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,960
does that mean being able to have things

790
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,320
that are have a strong enough business

791
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,120
case regardless of where the policy

792
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,799
winds blow have have resilient business

793
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,200
case that is able to be improved with

794
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:40,799
decisions that will be clarified along

795
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,600
the way that resiliency in the

796
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,000
infrastructure to be more Dynamic along

797
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,919
the way even having options that are not

798
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,799
able to be triggered since the day one

799
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,880
is essential to reduce the risk to

800
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:56,360
improve the the yes the terms of the

801
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,200
business yeah we've gotten to zero

802
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,159
minutes on this timer here I don't I

803
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,639
think that means that we're we go to Q&A

804
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:06,679
or does that mean that we are going to

805
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:07,880
get hooked off the stage here uh but um

806
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:09,760
well can you take a couple questions

807
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,799
okay so let's take a couple of questions

808
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,840
um on the minds of folks in the audience

809
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:15,240
I don't know if we've they've come

810
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,360
through nothing's showing up here I'm

811
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,440
just seeing the QR code for Pigeon holes

812
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,080
I don't see any questions um so does

813
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,080
that mean that none have come through P

814
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,639
oh there's a bunch of questions okay um

815
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,000
yeah I'd have to see them oh great okay

816
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:29,320
cool um so a lot has been discussed on

817
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,519
how sustainability needs to be

818
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,519
profitable how do you see um risk

819
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,440
mitigation and opportunity enhancement

820
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:42,080
impacting decisions despite the near

821
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,559
future cost um and um and then what role

822
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,039
does Downstream pressure from corporate

823
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,360
customers with their own Net Zero

824
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,720
commitments play in the business case

825
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,320
for a sustainable investment I want to

826
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,919
pick up on this second question here so

827
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,200
um as companies are setting Net Zero

828
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:01,440
targets um that means that they're

829
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,840
searching for Solutions um and then and

830
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,000
and presumably that helps to create a

831
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,519
market for those Solutions but there's

832
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,320
all kinds of ways that can break down um

833
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,039
whether those commitments are not seen

834
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,840
as serious whether they don't translate

835
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,039
into purchasing commitments what role

836
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,600
are you seeing in terms of the

837
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,039
translation of Net Zero commitments to

838
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,399
purchasing commitments for the kinds of

839
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,760
things that you're offering um and the

840
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,480
seriousness of those of those types of

841
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,440
commitments in in the I can I can

842
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,480
quickly start out so what's interesting

843
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,279
is

844
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,880
that the when a a company's

845
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,639
sustainability plan is supposed to be

846
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,600
disclosed um not only as a the

847
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:42,679
sustainability document or annual

848
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,360
sustainability reports but increasingly

849
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,480
what we depend on as investors is

850
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,200
something called a climate action plan

851
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,960
an IAP right the idea is what is what

852
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,320
does your path look like for

853
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,679
decarbonizing and to Net Zero the issue

854
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,799
is sometimes is that there's not enough

855
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,960
content in the I to understand what

856
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,240
exactly that path looks like number one

857
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,639
number two when you ask companies so

858
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,360
tell me exactly how much are you

859
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:08,119
spending on decarbonization they don't

860
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,839
want to disclose it they don't want to

861
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,679
disclose it for competitive reasons they

862
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,079
just they give you an overall capex

863
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,679
number um that includes everything um

864
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,240
and sustainability but when you try to

865
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,440
pin them down to tell them just tell me

866
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,440
your sustainability spend in capex with

867
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,320
overall capex it's very hard to come by

868
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,200
so I don't know what Demetrius why

869
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,919
companies are hesitant to to be very

870
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,560
open about their capex for example on

871
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:34,200
sustainability yeah I think because

872
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,480
first of all the standard in the way you

873
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,560
measure sustainability are not commonly

874
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,720
spread when you are not using for that

875
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,720
new type of currency the same level of

876
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,359
rigor you could create like a gambling

877
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,919
game it is very trustable if you are a

878
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,159
public Trade Company the level of

879
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:54,520
scrutiny in all those measure is is

880
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:57,359
really really high no we are on a yearly

881
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,760
basis elevating our climate plan to our

882
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,920
share holders they need to approve if

883
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,760
that plan is robust enough is detailed

884
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,800
enough and it's not just representing

885
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,720
aspirational Target without any

886
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,480
actionable short-term uh plan the

887
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,400
granularity and the level of um

888
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,040
implementation that a large corporation

889
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,200
has to deploy in order to convert the

890
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,960
aspirational net zero to a plan that

891
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,920
progressively will be using the

892
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,960
resources of the policy new processes

893
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,200
technology and the Academia to be super

894
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,240
robust otherwise we will create in those

895
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,280
hype Cycles moments where you are not

896
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,520
able to track and to create traction

897
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,320
enough in order to commit with the with

898
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,680
the Target no thinking in the scope one

899
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,440
in our case is is an obsession and it's

900
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,240
something that we self-imposed in the

901
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,640
last 15 years but when we are talking

902
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,440
about what is the most difficult

903
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,480
challenge for everyone how to manage in

904
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,400
our case we have more than 40 50,000

905
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,560
suppliers to synchronize their own plans

906
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,400
in order to be emed in our own strategy

907
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,440
to guarantee that we are not running

908
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,599
ahead because we depend completely on

909
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,440
them is even more essential we have

910
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,280
suppliers in North Carolina South

911
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,920
Carolina or in Virginia that are not

912
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,920
seen with the same lens and with the

913
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,480
same sense of urgency how important is

914
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,400
for them we are not creating synergies

915
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,680
in the way we are using the data where

916
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
we we are using circular economy and the

917
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,960
re utilization of the material along the

918
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,319
pathway of a of a highway no and those

919
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,880
externalities will have to be

920
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:34,200
synchronized at the level of of the

921
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,920
ecosystem otherwise we are not going to

922
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,920
tackle the scope to and never the scope

923
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,480
three yeah yeah and and and there's a

924
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:46,440
lot of different um tools that companies

925
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,920
are using to um to to do to design that

926
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,480
kind of carbon strategy and they're

927
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,599
they're they're setting they're they're

928
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,200
defining Net Zero and different ways

929
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,960
they're very different in terms of their

930
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,280
seriousness of having a reduction

931
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,319
strategy um and and uh and they're

932
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,079
measuring with a great variety of

933
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,480
different mechanisms as we're learning

934
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:08,160
through our aggregate confusion project

935
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,760
at MIT Sloan um you know the the

936
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,160
measurement challenges here are are are

937
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,880
pretty substantial um I think we are

938
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,760
well out of time is that right um so

939
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,920
we're gonna we're going to cut this

940
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,400
short um but uh I I really appreciate

941
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,200

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,110
and thanks to all the audience for for

943
