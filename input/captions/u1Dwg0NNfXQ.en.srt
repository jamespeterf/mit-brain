1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,320
Okay. Uh I think we'll start off this

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,799
panel. Uh we have a uh a great uh

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
cross-section of uh people from

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,240
different types of companies. So uh

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
probably the best way to introduce

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
everyone is to let them introduce

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,640
themselves their names and what their

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,400
role is at their organizations as well

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,240
as maybe uh a one sentence about uh your

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,719
your take on software engine AI and

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,559
software engineering. So uh Lis Lisa you

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,120
want to take it away. Thank you. Uh so

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm Lisa Meanie. I'm from IBM Research

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,079
uh just down the road 314 uh Maine. So I

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,480
am the uh the site lead exec for IBM

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,600
Research Cambridge. uh but my real day

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,520
job is that uh I leave our I lead our uh

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,879
global research strategy on u uh AI for

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
data platforms. So it's kind of

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,000
interesting that uh Kion went just

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
before us and was talking about

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
structured data uh because uh you know

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,120
as you can imagine IBM has a lot of data

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
products. So databases, data warehouses,

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,000
uh data lakeouses, knowledge catalogs,

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,240
uh ETL systems. So we have a lot of

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
products that are really around this uh

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560
structured data structured

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
semi-structured uh we obviously do some

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,720
as well as unstructured. Uh and what

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,640
we're doing is to basically uh infuse AI

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,880
uh to accelerate those systems, make

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
them much more uh self-service. So

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,640
natural language access to your

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,439
databases to make them more uh

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,280
efficient, to make them more

37
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,560
explainable. Um and then what we're also

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,960
doing is to try to make those systems um

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,000
better serve the data for Genai and um

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,920
um Agentic workflows. Uh so accelerate

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,520
them, you know. So one of the big topics

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,439
these days is can we uh take re reinvent

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,399
databases data lakeouses these sorts of

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,640
things uh and optimize them on on GPUs

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
as is just one example. So so there's a

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,439
lot of examples but just to try to give

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,320
you uh you know a feel for that. Uh and

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,200
in terms of the perspective on um you

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,959
know AI for uh for software engineering

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,800
uh obviously you know I'm I'm at IBM

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,160
research and we're creating a lot of you

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
know we're doing this we're trying to

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
create the tools are trying to uh to

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440
create the technologies for this. So

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,239
obviously uh you know I have a very

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,239
positive view a lot of what I do is um

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,560
software engineering in that data space.

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
So it turns out that in addition to the

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,680
databases and so on there's a lot of

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,480
code around it. Um so you know SQL code

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,959
so uh so generating SQL code generating

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,599
GraphQL uh code uh being able to

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,959
generate code for managing and operating

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,280
uh these systems. So we do a lot in uh

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,959
generating that that type of um of

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,280
codes. Great Wilco. Awesome. Uh hello

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm Wiling. I'm the senior director in

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
industrial robotics and vision at

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,360
Symbotic. Symbotic we are reinventing

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,640
the warehouse. Imagine a warehouse that

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,159
delivers groceries uh to your store or

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,319
anything else really. Um we use robots

73
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,640
um mostly to do that. So any kind of

74
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,640
robot you can really imagine. We have a

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,879
number of robot arms at all of our

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,800
sites. Um we also have Simbots which are

77
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,200
basically small autonomous systems,

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,680
autonomous robots which drive around and

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,519
deliver goods um inside the the

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
warehouse that we have. Um the

81
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,120
interesting thing is that we are really

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,519
operating at scale. We have robotics

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,920
deployed at scale. We are at around 50

84
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,599
warehouses in the US and each of these

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,640
warehouses we have hundreds of robots

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,280
and thousands of symbots. And you can

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,120
imagine that um that's a lot of scale

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,200
just to think about all the data that we

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
get in and like one of the interesting

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,599
components I think that we realize is

91
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,680
that you can engineer against 99.9% of

92
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,680
what's really happening right but the

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,840
0.1% is really what gets you. And at

94
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,799
every at any given day we touch about 10

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
million cases in the US alone. And

96
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,280
that's that's a lot of cases that go

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,040
wrong if.1% is what's failing you right.

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
So we need to really build the these

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,200
these pipelines that we cannot engineer

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,280
against and bring down over time the

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,319
issues that we see think about

102
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,720
automating uh the processes to identify

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
these issues cluster them and then pick

104
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,639
up the engineering processes to bring

105
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,320
them down over time. Right? And you can

106
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,600
imagine there's a lot of R&D involved in

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
this process and um yeah AI in software

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,840
engineering really helps us to bring

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,400
down this kind of um R&D process right

110
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,720
so in R&D you really try to reduce the

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,040
amount of time it takes for you to

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
derisk

113
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,400
something for you to solve a problem

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,919
right so if you can suddenly start doing

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
these things it may not be like the

116
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,400
final approach that you're actually

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,840
executing but it's maybe the the um the

118
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
direction that you would derisk and say

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
this is the right way to do it and then

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,440
we bring it to to engineering and

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,479
finally productionize it. I think that's

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,960
one of the main um progress areas where

123
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,560
we currently see like the main benefit.

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Yeah.

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,639
Simon. All right. Uh Simon Lee um from

126
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,080
Humanana. Uh for those of you that have

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
heard of Humanana, you might probably

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,400
know us more as a health insurance

129
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,360
company. We serve um many Medicare and

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,199
Medicaid members, but recently of course

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
uh we've been more vertically integrated

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
into the healthcare industry. So we

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
actually operate a lot of primary care

134
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
clinics now. Uh we have a sizable

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
pharmacy business. So we really are

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,320
vertic we really are a more of a

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,560
healthcare delivery and a payer as well.

138
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,560
So uh as for my day job uh my role is a

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,840
director in data science but what I

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,160
actually do is I lead a small team um

141
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,520
and we serve as basically the innovation

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,280
lab for the enterprise. Um we are

143
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,600
cross-disciplinary all inhouse. Uh

144
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,199
software building is a team sport deeply

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
rooted in human- centered design

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,960
methodologies and we practice them on a

147
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,280
daily basis in order to achieve uh

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,280
desired outcomes for the users of the

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,440
solutions that we implement. Um recently

150
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,720
as you can tell like for in any

151
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,800
innovation sort of uh fashion AI is a

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
very large part of what we are really

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,039
investigating. Um, for me in terms of

154
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,360
like uh what AI really means for me is

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,400
it's the newest tool in the toolbox for

156
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,479
us to be able to utilize in order to

157
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,840
create engaging software and experiences

158
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,680
for our members, our patients, our

159
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,240
associates. And you're looking for

160
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
various ways we can apply the emerging

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,360
technologies in order for us to come up

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,840
with new solutions that achieve business

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,440
outcomes.

164
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Great. uh I think to to sort of um delve

165
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,360
in a little bit deeper into your

166
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,759
introductions

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,280
uh can you uh give any feedback on what

168
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,880
specific AI tools that you're using now

169
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,880
and maybe or or just in general like

170
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,919
what the current state of AI and

171
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,759
software engineering at your

172
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,560
organizations what are you finding

173
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,960
that's working uh and maybe even more

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
important are there any things that are

175
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,720
sort of disappointing or maybe a little

176
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,039
bit further off than that the hype would

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,360
suggest. um when it comes to AI and

178
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,840
software engineering.

179
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,199
How do you want to uh look look like you

180
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,560
want it safe? Okay. Okay. So, uh you

181
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,400
know, as you can imagine, right, in

182
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
terms of the tools, um obviously there's

183
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,759
a lot there in terms of the ids, right?

184
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,280
So, copilot and uh you know, uh most

185
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,440
recently, I think there's a new update

186
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,599
for the uh like the cursor, which is

187
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,880
actually pretty uh pretty impressive in

188
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
terms of what they've done with with

189
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,520
MCP. And so, MIT grads. Yeah. Yeah. It's

190
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,280
it's it's good work, right? So I think

191
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,120
especially the the latest release if you

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,639
haven't tried that you know it's I you

193
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
know it's not an IBM product but I think

194
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
it's quite good. Um IBM has our own

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,479
Watson code assistant as well. So that's

196
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,319
used pervasively. Uh so what I would say

197
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,400
is you know when you hear at least from

198
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,000
my perspective when you hear like some

199
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,240
people are saying you know 90% of the

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,360
code uh you know that in my production

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
environment is you know AI generated you

202
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,360
know I kind of think maybe a lot of that

203
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,039
is autocomplete types of things you know

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
maybe little smaller things that might

205
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,440
get generated like a web landing page

206
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,680
these sorts of things um as opposed to

207
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,800
the kind of enterprise uh software that

208
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,960
that we see. Um so what I thought I'd do

209
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,840
is maybe talk about um you know some of

210
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
that and how that's kind of changing um

211
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,599
um software engineering. So one of the

212
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,160
big trends that we see uh in terms of

213
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,800
how AI is influencing this is that you

214
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,279
know entire enterprise applications are

215
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,279
being uh restructured right. So it used

216
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
to be that you would have you know you

217
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
would have applications that were

218
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,680
holistically written to take on you know

219
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,839
HR uh or to take on you know supply

220
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,160
chain or you know all these different uh

221
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,080
software uh media components that you

222
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
would need to have. Uh and one of the

223
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,560
big problems was okay how do you

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,640
integrate all of this data across this?

225
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,920
So you know a lot of times you have some

226
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
you know part of your application that

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,360
you're building is trying to go against

228
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
these APIs for this system or maybe it's

229
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,240
against these databases trying to pull

230
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,399
that data back trying to do some

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,200
business logic upon that maybe mapping

232
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,200
it to fields in another uh you know API

233
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
or database or these sorts of things you

234
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
know that's that's not so easy for the

235
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,720
AI to just figure out how it's going to

236
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
write it's not even that easy for a

237
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,440
human to say what they would want from

238
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
that in in natural language. Um so the

239
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,399
other approach that we're seeing there

240
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,760
that I think is a big change for

241
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,240
software engineers for software

242
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,399
engineering uh is the way that those uh

243
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,160
are being structured. Um so what's

244
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,760
happening is that there's you know it's

245
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,279
kind of the I would say it's sort of the

246
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
next generation of the chatbot. The

247
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,240
first thing of the chatbot was just let

248
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
me ask my question and give me back some

249
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,800
data. Okay that's good. It's give me

250
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,200
back some information and I can

251
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,279
interact. uh the next stage the next

252
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,360
wave was to say okay well I should be

253
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,519
able to get that from basically any

254
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
system across the enterprise right and I

255
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,920
should be able to so this is kind of

256
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,440
moving from chatbots and interactions

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,640
more to process orchestration uh process

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,880
automation right uh and then so these uh

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,640
these are being written very differently

260
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,279
uh in terms of saying okay I just need

261
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,120
to sort of specify what are the tools

262
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,440
meaning the APIs or the tools that help

263
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
me to access those I need to uh think

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,399
about different sequences and when those

265
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
need to be um uh you know invoked and so

266
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
on. I would like to try to do that as

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,079
autonomously as possible with these

268
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,399
agentic approaches and so on. Um and so

269
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,800
I think this is going to cause uh a very

270
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,399
significant uh change of how because

271
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,240
that's AI underneath that's allowing you

272
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,880
to do that. It's AI that's allowing you

273
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,800
to uh you know generate the uh you know

274
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,880
the code from the natural language that

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
would then you know decide on how to

276
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
orchestrate which of the different tools

277
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,839
to call and all of these sorts of

278
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,800
things. So, so that is AI deeply infused

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,519
for many different tasks um that would

280
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,720
traditionally uh be a much more complex

281
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,320
uh software engineering um task. So, um

282
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,560
I think that's something that's uh kind

283
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,560
of a big a big area that you want.

284
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,920
Um I would say as far as like code

285
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,040
generation, we're still learning. Um

286
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,279
we're we're we've tested out a few

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,480
different solutions so far. Kodium,

288
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:20,000
we're currently testing out Co C-Pilot.

289
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,680
Um we're not seeing as much of a

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,240
productivity like enhancement,

291
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,760
especially with some of our senior

292
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,839
engineers versus what we normally get

293
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,160
out of like ReSharper if we're doing C#

294
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,279
because like 40% of it for like

295
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,360
boilerplate code that you just in

296
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,560
anyways.

297
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,920
So for more seasoned engineers, I think

298
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
we haven't seen a whole lot of

299
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
productivity gain. For newer engineers,

300
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,120
junior engineers, it's a great learning

301
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,320
tool. Um, and I think it's a it's it's a

302
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,079
a way for them to start like um getting

303
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,560
more experience, hands-on keyboard type

304
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,640
experience coming up to spec. That's

305
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:02,480
what we've sort of seen.

306
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:04,560
Um, but as far as like it being like

307
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
deep productivity, it's not a panacea.

308
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,600
It's it's not something that's going to

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,560
solve all your problems. It it can

310
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
definitely be an assistant, but

311
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
everything that comes out of it, you're

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
always going to have to sort of like

313
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,279
give it another overview and look and

314
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,560
and and be and be sure that it is

315
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
accomplishing the actual task that

316
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
you're looking to accomplish. So, for

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,399
the most part, I think it's been it's

318
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,880
been great. like um all of our software

319
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,200
engineers especially at the XC love

320
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,440
using AI assisted uh code generation

321
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,519
just because it is

322
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,839
a if anything it at least allows you to

323
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,120
save a few keystrokes on the keyboard.

324
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,720
Um but as far as like being able to

325
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,880
trust everything that comes out of it

326
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,760
you it's not there yet. Um so another

327
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,600
area that we definitely are looking at

328
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,680
um like I said before software

329
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,320
engineering building software solutions

330
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,959
as a team sport. So reducing cognitive

331
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
burdens on like keyway testers um making

332
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,959
uh we're doing a lot of work right now

333
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,200
on

334
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,920
um trying to generate uh uh regression

335
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,320
test cases um for actual like

336
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,279
point-and-click regression solutions.

337
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,040
Um, but we

338
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:16,959
found generally that like out of the box

339
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,200
solutions are missing some of the sort

340
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,200
historical context that like our testers

341
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,880
are used to seeing. Um, so it's it's not

342
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:31,600
that it doesn't provide good test cases.

343
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,160
it just it's missing sort of the way we

344
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,120
used to write test cases so that people

345
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,120
like understand and be able to um run

346
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,839
the test cases like they normally would

347
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,320
right so and people are very adaptable

348
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:49,120
so like I'm sure that learning curve

349
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,680
would would be fairly quickly um but the

350
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,360
initial sort of roll out and sort of the

351
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:59,560
negative responses to this uh the test

352
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,880
cases that were generated has been

353
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,279
um it's been a little bit more uh uh

354
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,079
intense than what we initially thought.

355
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,240
So going something like a rack pattern

356
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,399
utilizing previous test cases to inject

357
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,480
some context into like how our

358
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,800
organizations and enterprises and teams

359
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,760
have generally written test cases to fit

360
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,399
a certain scenario to be able to like

361
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,959
then enhance the actual outputs going

362
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,360
back to the solution. I think that's but

363
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,279
that's that's that's one uh much more

364
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
positive experiences from the actual end

365
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,079
users and like the our QA test case

366
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,560
writers and whatnot in order for those

367
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,560
solutions to be sort of more acceptable.

368
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,720
So okay there a couple areas that we're

369
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,920
we're looking into. Yeah. Anything to

370
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,199
add Wilco? Uh maybe like one or two

371
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,040
things I think

372
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:53,600
one I think under uh appreciated benefit

373
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,279
of of these like chat bots in general. I

374
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,120
think but also the idees that you

375
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,279
mentioned is that you cannot get over

376
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,519
your pro procrastination hump right so

377
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,199
there's a lot of work that is that I'm

378
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,199
struggling to get started with right and

379
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,279
I know there's like a lot of burden

380
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,839
until I actually get to my idea that I

381
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,760
want to execute on right so if I can

382
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,279
bring down that burden much more I

383
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,959
actually get to the stuff that I want to

384
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,800
do and like I want to prove that works

385
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,839
much quicker and I think that's one of

386
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,240
the main benefits that I see that our

387
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,000
engineers basically don't get bogged

388
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
down in the details but they can focus

389
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
more on the big picture kind of things

390
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,560
that they want to execute on. And that's

391
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,079
a huge benefit. Not just yes, they're

392
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,000
more productive, but it's also they're

393
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,480
happier working on the things that they

394
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,360
actually want to work on rather than the

395
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,839
minor things. Um, and then another thing

396
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,160
is like there already a lot of quick

397
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,279
wins that you can get like one is for

398
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
example writing back better

399
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,720
documentation, right? I mean these are

400
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,240
like things that we struggle with. It's

401
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
always something that comes last that

402
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,160
should come first, right? Same thing for

403
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,759
writing tests, right? I think we can all

404
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
do better at writing tests. So, I mean,

405
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
I'm not saying you should autogenerate

406
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,759
all your tests, but like if they can

407
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,519
help you to discover more test case that

408
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,440
you haven't even thought about, that's

409
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,000
great, right? Um, you still need to

410
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,279
check your code. I agree though. Yeah.

411
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,759
Um, I think these are like things I want

412
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:17,120
to add. Um just sort of a as I did some

413
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,440
research for this uh forum today just

414
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,199
listened to a lot of current software

415
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,759
engineers talk about their job and what

416
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,360
they see as it impacting and um one of

417
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,880
the areas and and we didn't bring this

418
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
up today but some of the things in the

419
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,519
news that would you know maybe scare

420
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,199
some young software engineers is Mark

421
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,000
Zuckerberg saying yeah we're we're going

422
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,720
to hire less software engineers and um I

423
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,399
think Sam Alman made a a similar

424
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:48,000
claim the CEO of Nvidia

425
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,839
uh and uh a lot of what I'm hearing that

426
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,560
if you are specialized in say writing

427
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,920
code then that that's sort of

428
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,759
problematic because as a software

429
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,160
engineer you're going to have somebody

430
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,519
who's going to have to be able to one

431
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,040
probably the I would say the most

432
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
important thing would be requirements

433
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,799
analysis being able to understand what

434
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,240
what the heck the problem is because

435
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,160
anyone who's been a software engineer

436
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,600
has delivered software and then user who

437
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,439
signed off on the spec said that's not

438
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,799
what I want. Uh so uh never happened.

439
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,480
Never not ever. Uh you know so so being

440
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,000
able to understand the problem is is is

441
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,360
a is a big deal. Um uh maybe writing

442
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,039
code to do a a simple routine is an easy

443
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,600
easier thing that will be replaced

444
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,679
first. And it sounds like maybe that

445
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,440
sort of

446
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,000
offloads more mundane tasks for a

447
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,440
software engineer that you you sort of

448
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,280
go from being a coder to maybe you know

449
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,280
orchestrating the the whole process

450
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,880
whether it's from requirements analysis

451
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,200
to coding testing software life cycle

452
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,320
project management planning planning it

453
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,799
out uh and then you know security part

454
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,559
of that of course so is is that

455
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,080
something you and then a lot of what I'm

456
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,360
hearing you're saying now is I'm

457
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,520
wondering are are some of these things

458
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,240
problematic at the moment but are

459
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,160
problems that going to be solved and I

460
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,240
guess one of the things we talked about

461
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,960
be when we all met uh to talk about the

462
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,760
panel is we want to convey to the

463
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,200
audience okay if your profession is

464
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,039
software engineer where do we think that

465
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,160
you should be going what should you be

466
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,160
focusing on in order to sure ensure you

467
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,280
know one that you're employed and and

468
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,600
and your your career thrives in the the

469
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,880
near and distant future. So, uh that

470
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,960
being said, okay, I know if nobody uh

471
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
and and also the audience, we we have

472
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
some microphones and we could probably

473
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,039
at this point just open it up if you

474
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,039
have some input. I'm sure there's many

475
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,880
people that are are are having thoughts

476
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,200
in this area. Yeah, I can say a few

477
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,360
words on this one. So I would say that I

478
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,280
think first off in terms of you know uh

479
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,360
imminent doom for software engineers in

480
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,120
terms of not being needed uh you know

481
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,120
clearly we're not there right I mean we

482
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,320
not quite yet there right um however

483
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,000
what I would say is that um the field of

484
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,720
software engineering will change you

485
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,520
know what we do as software engineers uh

486
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,360
will change um but it always has right

487
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,039
so I don't think that that's any

488
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,000
different from things we've faced in the

489
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,320
past um I think what will happen is that

490
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,679
um you know some of the mindset uh for

491
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
how we develop software will change

492
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,520
right so it's it's like you know we used

493
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,679
to worry about how to build you know

494
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
very large complex systems you know they

495
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,280
talked about these waterfall models for

496
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,039
how you would design all of this uh and

497
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,960
and we sort of changed to doing much

498
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,640
more iterative kinds of things putting

499
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
things together integrating going cross

500
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
system mapping migration all these sorts

501
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,360
of things so I think that's one change

502
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,840
that we already are seeing and that's

503
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,960
what I was uh talking about earlier and

504
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,559
and AI is going to to help with that um

505
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
so I think there's there's first off

506
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,160
there's kind of a change in in even

507
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,240
mindset and and then the way we approach

508
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
the problems much more iterative, right?

509
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
Like you you kind of get started with

510
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,039
some of the tools, you start to test

511
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
things out or you know you start off

512
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,320
with you know you're looking at a piece

513
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
of code and you ask for a summary or you

514
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,360
you know or you generate a you know a

515
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,679
code tree or these sorts of things and

516
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,200
those can help you uh to get into it

517
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,799
much more uh quickly. Um I think the

518
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
other thing is that what what you're

519
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,200
seeing with some of this code Jen is

520
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,919
that it's true that some of the code

521
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,679
could be written uh with someone who is

522
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,480
less skilled maybe you know a more

523
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,760
junior person can go further uh using

524
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,159
some of these tools but I think the

525
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,840
other change would be that yes it's

526
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,480
possible that with the code generation

527
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,320
someone who is more of like um you know

528
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,440
even a higher level who might be more in

529
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,000
the business or a business user uh by

530
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,919
you know expressing what they not have

531
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,799
code generated and and brought to them.

532
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,080
But that takes a lot of complex, you

533
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,720
know, software underneath there. You're

534
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,280
not just going to point a business user

535
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,280
at uh, you know, chat GPT and have them,

536
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,280
you know, generate these very complex

537
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,120
uh, subsystems. That's that's a that's a

538
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,640
that's quite a long ways off at at best.

539
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,880
Um I also think that uh you know uh what

540
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,039
happens is that it's you know each time

541
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,400
we say oh you know this is you know

542
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,000
something's happening and we don't need

543
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,559
to you know do this anymore we don't

544
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,919
need the software engineers uh I think

545
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,799
what's going to what you'll see is

546
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,559
you'll see a lot more code being written

547
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,400
right so it's not maybe it's not so much

548
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,159
that you know software is you know that

549
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,520
if we said that we were constraining you

550
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
know we're saying okay exactly the same

551
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,760
amount of code is needed forever right

552
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,240
and more of that code can be written by

553
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,440
AI then okay might maybe that affects

554
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,200
you know the the need for software

555
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,240
engineers but I think that what will

556
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,760
happen instead is the amount of code uh

557
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,919
you know and code maybe for special

558
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,080
purpose for special uses you know in the

559
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,159
moment that's needed and so on can be

560
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,320
generated um than what we could do

561
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,919
before right and so that sort of changes

562
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,159
the dynamic but it doesn't necessarily

563
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,720
mean that there's not that continued

564
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,960
need for for good uh software

565
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,720
engineering skills um I think the other

566
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,360
thing is that you know you have to think

567
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,559
about not only the iterative approach um

568
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,480
but also uh for these large uh systems

569
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,039
thinking about systems of software right

570
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,440
so it's going to be systems of models

571
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,480
systems of tools systems of workflows

572
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,640
working together those can get very um

573
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,039
you know very uh complex and so I think

574
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,120
that uh there's a lot of need for these

575
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,720
different levels of software engineers

576
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,039
um that would you know look into uh and

577
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,799
be expert in in in various areas so it

578
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,520
used to be you know there was like web

579
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,440
developers primarily arily so you know

580
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
will this change web development I think

581
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,960
probably you know we are seeing some in

582
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,120
terms of you know even some of these

583
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,919
tools you know full stack you know at

584
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,600
least to get started more rapid

585
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,240
prototype there's a lot of complexity

586
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,640
and more need for more software that I

587
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,240
feel uh very good about uh you know

588
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
students and people going into the

589
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,080
software engineering field and will be

590
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,159
needed for quite some time. So are you

591
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,919
all still hiring software engineers

592
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,400
here? Yes. Anyone bring their resume

593
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,760
today?

594
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,280
We have a career fair following this. So

595
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,640
maybe we'll come maybe I can address

596
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,320
this from like a macro perspective

597
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,559
because in the robotics space we've

598
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,520
always had this fear that everybody gets

599
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,360
replaced by robots over time, right? And

600
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,280
I mean this is like decades old. I would

601
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,640
say hasn't really happened yet. And I

602
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
mean maybe you can argue that there's

603
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,480
some component here in the velocity of

604
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,640
what we do. But I I would see the world

605
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,240
is not as a fixed pie or like a zero sum

606
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,080
game, right? We will all be productive.

607
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,360
We will just do more awesome things over

608
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,159
time, right? So, and I think the the

609
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,520
point I want to make here is that we can

610
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,720
actually focus more on the things that

611
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,799
we really want to do rather than like

612
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,559
get boggled down in the minor things,

613
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,720
right? And I think that bringing down

614
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,559
the barrier that junior folks can do

615
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,400
this is I think is a positive thing. But

616
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,320
the other thing is also there's still

617
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,320
the need for experience over time,

618
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
right? It's more maybe on a higher level

619
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,679
where you can think about more of a

620
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,320
complex system that you can actually

621
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,240
tackle where previously you would have

622
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,840
to just for the communication across all

623
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,480
these teams that you would have to

624
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,960
negotiate over and like deal with over

625
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,559
time. It would just take it 10 years to

626
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
get something done that suddenly can

627
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,480
actually be done in one year and

628
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,159
suddenly it's not that you these

629
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,440
projects you would not have done in the

630
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,960
first place before because they would

631
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,320
have been just too too big and too

632
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
expensive and suddenly we have this

633
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,720
enabler we can suddenly start doing

634
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,120
these things right and that's amazing um

635
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,480
and yes symbolic is still hiring and uh

636
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,480
we do awesome stuff here so right

637
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,400
um I guess I'll nerd out for a bit uh so

638
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,440
to me like software engineers in the

639
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,039
future

640
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,320
I I definitely see AI impacting sort of

641
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:45,440
the way they learn software engineering,

642
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,600
not in academia, but like in actual

643
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,120
practice because if I think about the

644
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,360
way um I gained my experience as a

645
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,120
junior developer and working my way up

646
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,320
to senior and lead and so on and so

647
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,440
forth, I've probably spent countless

648
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,799
hours on MSDN. First time I looked at as

649
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,400
a junior developer and looking at all

650
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,240
those angle brackets, I had no idea what

651
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,919
I was looking at. It took time for me to

652
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,640
figure out like how to read those

653
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,919
documents, how to understand the

654
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,559
interfaces. Earlier, uh, one of the

655
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,159
presenters said like a good portion of

656
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,679
enterprise development is basically

657
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,080
negotiating those API interfaces um, and

658
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,919
being able to understand that and

659
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,000
looking through the document. It's a

660
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,840
skill to be able to read those types of

661
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,200
tech docs, right? I don't think you

662
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,520
really need to do that anymore as a

663
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,600
junior developer. You just ask the AI,

664
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,440
how do you implement this interface and

665
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,760
it's it's done, right? You don't

666
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
necessarily have to look look at all

667
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,200
those nested angle brackets and figure

668
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,600
out like this interfaces are coming from

669
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,320
that subclass and everything else. So I

670
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,240
think um just for productivity gains, I

671
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,480
think that's going to be huge because a

672
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,200
good portion of my time especially as a

673
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,000
junior developer was negotiating those

674
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,600
interfaces, especially in Java and C.

675
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,919
Um, and I don't think those languages

676
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,360
are going away anytime soon. Um, even

677
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:06,080
though everybody loves Python. Uh, and

678
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,279
secondarily, I think because of that,

679
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,919
it's going to be imperative that

680
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,600
people come into it because part of that

681
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,320
skill learning to read those technical

682
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,080
documentation, understanding those

683
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,480
interfaces is you sort of get a better

684
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,120
idea on the underlying software

685
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,919
engineering practices. What is a factory

686
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,919
method? What's the factory pattern? um

687
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,000
polymorphism versus inheritance. When

688
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,480
are you supposed to use those? If you

689
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,880
have and and you develop intuition in

690
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,559
your gut as a software engineer, you you

691
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,200
looking at a peerreview code and you

692
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,520
see, you know, something like private

693
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,520
static int count, you're like

694
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,240
no, no, that is not a thing that we do.

695
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,240
So,

696
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,799
um, because of all of that, like I think

697
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,600
when you're,

698
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:59,520
um, learning to

699
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,440
compose different modules together, it's

700
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,600
not necessarily the act of writing the

701
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,600
code, but it's understanding how to put

702
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,120
systems together is really where

703
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
software engineers in the future are

704
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,600
going to have to put their uh, focus on

705
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,159
learning is how, especially in an

706
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,320
enterprise environment, how different

707
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,000
components and modules fit together in

708
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,679
order to actually deliver the solution

709
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,080
and solve a problem for people. Great.

710
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,880
Um I I want to see at this point does uh

711
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,279
anyone from the audience want to Yes.

712
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,279
That's right. Uh do we have the

713
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,919
microphone?

714
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,720
I I work in an enterprise of 200,000

715
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,720
people

716
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:44,240
which is on the technology organization

717
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,080
and the question that um Thank you. A

718
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,880
question I have maybe it's a long shot

719
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,120
but do you have so yesterday we were

720
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,360
talking about the expertise used to be a

721
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,480
collection of factual information and

722
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,480
then we built experts on career paths on

723
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,880
our IT organizations information

724
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,880
organizations accordingly now it's

725
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,760
changed with

726
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,600
the rapid change in AI landscape how are

727
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,279
we going to change how we think about

728
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,399
human resources in bigger contexts so in

729
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,039
a small startup scale up maybe easier

730
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,760
you know what is the bleeding edge skill

731
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,440
you need in that team however what it

732
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,679
would look like in an enterprise that

733
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,080
you already have like tens and thousands

734
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,000
of people

735
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,000
sure I fully understood the the question

736
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,360
you're saying what would the career path

737
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,159
or the yeah so the skills will change

738
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,960
yes the jobs will change so do you have

739
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:44,399
a view what the new groups of job

740
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,520
families and career pathway oh Okay,

741
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,520
that's a good question.

742
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,320
Um, so yeah, I'm I'm not sure that I

743
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,640
Yeah, so we haven't gone and and sort of

744
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,480
reorganized uh completely. What I would

745
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,320
say is that you know what we are seeing

746
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,799
is um a lot more uh you know it used to

747
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,279
be application developers for example

748
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,000
now a lot of we refer to as a as a as an

749
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,159
AI developer AI engineer what they need

750
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,080
to have is they need to have a lot they

751
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,679
need to have savvy both in software

752
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,480
engineering as well as AI and how to use

753
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,320
um the models you know for their uh for

754
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,240
their uh you know in order to accomplish

755
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,240
their their tasks and so

756
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,320
We haven't um I don't think we've

757
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:35,279
changed our our roles per se. So

758
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,039
there's probably some additions AI cyber

759
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,279
security for example that didn't exist

760
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,000
before definitely need that now. Yeah.

761
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah. Application. Yeah. So my my

762
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,919
question was on the similar line but

763
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,559
it's different like you know the train

764
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,399
has left the station. We know that

765
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,039
sometime there is going to be that

766
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,679
convergence between here are the skill

767
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,640
gaps that got or the new skills that

768
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,360
will be required in future and here are

769
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,480
the skills that's going to slowly go

770
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,600
away or taken over by AI but when it

771
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,159
comes to timeline right you know from

772
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,000
academic point of view are there new

773
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,440
subjects new areas new certification

774
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,279
programs that's going to be rolled out

775
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,279
so that they're aware

776
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,799
this is where you need to upskill. This

777
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:25,520
is where you need to go and gain more

778
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,919
you know certification so you're

779
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,480
prepared for when that thing dies here

780
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,159
is where you are headed. Okay. Okay.

781
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,159
That that helps. Um. Yeah. So, so from

782
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,919
from my perspective at least, I think

783
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,120
one of the spaces I would advise people

784
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,279
that are in the software engineering

785
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,000
space is to spend. So, first thing would

786
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,559
be uh you really need to keep up with

787
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,159
the frameworks, right? So, you know, uh

788
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,880
lang chain, you know, lang flow,

789
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,480
langraph, uh llama index, uh you know,

790
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,840
uh MCP, uh you know, um crew crew AI,

791
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440
you know, there's just a lot of

792
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,159
frameworks for being able to develop

793
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,399
applications with AI. That's kind of one

794
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,840
piece of it. And then the that's kind of

795
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,600
like just the base of like you said

796
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,919
understanding the API books and and and

797
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,480
that first part right uh and then I

798
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,600
think that the next part is that I do

799
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,399
believe um that uh you know as we write

800
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,640
things as uh multiple agents uh and

801
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,039
engaging with

802
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,080
tools our our our ideas of architecture

803
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,080
change uh quite a bit right uh you know

804
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,440
it used to be you know we you know there

805
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,039
was precision in APIs what the call

806
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,960
would do what you would get back at

807
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,559
least you know you know yes there were

808
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,240
you know issues people but you know you

809
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,440
were well constrained in terms of inputs

810
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,159
and outputs and all these sorts of

811
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,640
things um and yes it is you know

812
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,080
adjusting uh these agentic uh model

813
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,840
interfaces are adjusting and originally

814
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,159
it was just natural language in now

815
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,080
there's more structured um interfaces to

816
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,240
them paidantic AI and these sorts of

817
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,640
things that give you some structure but

818
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,440
uh nonetheless what I would say is that

819
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,120
I think there's going to be a major

820
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,679
transformation in how we do software

821
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,960
engineering with these Eentic approaches

822
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,760
where it is much more iterative than uh

823
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,320
what we've seen before where uh you know

824
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,080
you instead of just uh API in you make

825
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,080
your API call and you get exactly what

826
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,240
you want back uh in this case you know

827
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,840
you you you uh you make your you know

828
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,399
call to the tool or whatever you get

829
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,480
something back right uh you may need

830
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,960
some refinement some iteration on that

831
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,640
you know you you would also need um so

832
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,320
so there's the systems themselves that

833
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,240
are doing and then there are checkers

834
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,240
right validations and so on need to

835
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,440
happen. Um, you know, there's agents

836
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,279
that sit, you know, one of the big

837
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,279
things that we do is agents not just

838
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,720
agentic approach is not just to

839
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,559
accomplish the task. Um, but agents for

840
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,399
being able to for these systems be able

841
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,000
to monitor to detect uh problems to uh,

842
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,760
you know, generate what might be a

843
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,480
description of the problem that could be

844
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,919
in a you know, put into a git issue. uh

845
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,039
be able to, you know, look at that,

846
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,880
diagnose, generate a plan, be able to uh

847
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,640
generate, you know, maybe code to to do

848
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,399
the patches, you know, to be able to

849
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
generate code that would test, generate

850
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,640
that code that would validate that. So

851
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,080
there it's just it's a it's it's kind of

852
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,000
it's a very different way of

853
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,679
architecting these systems. And so I

854
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
would say, you know, like I said, the

855
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,480
frameworks first. Um that's just basic

856
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,760
learning. uh and then really getting in

857
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,159
and getting your hands dirty and

858
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,080
thinking about how your ideas of design

859
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,760
and architecture change if you're

860
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,640
approaching it with this agentic and and

861
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,200
more iterative approaches uh with more

862
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,679
validation uh confirmation more back and

863
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,360
forth more of maybe consulting a human

864
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,519
as opposed to the human being the

865
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,760
director uh for you know for the task

866
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,679
and asking for things right I want to

867
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,200
tie this like back to the previous

868
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,559
question I think like we also need to

869
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,640
take a look at like how organization

870
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,320
changes not just the roles themselves

871
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,559
But I think it's much more important

872
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,799
because people can do much more now.

873
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,960
It's I think organizations will be much

874
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,720
flatter and I think organizations will

875
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,720
be also uh giving people much more um

876
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,080
like responsibility of what they can do

877
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,360
what they can do right so I think we

878
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,919
will reward agency high agency much more

879
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,760
individualism and basically just going

880
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,679
out there and doing it right so we're

881
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,159
not here to just write code right we're

882
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,960
writing basically code to solve problems

883
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,800
and the problem solving I think is more

884
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,359
what's going to be at the core and I my

885
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,119
hypothesis is that people

886
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:22,960
will be better at being generalists and

887
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,599
basically interdisciplinary across

888
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,320
different domains rather than pure

889
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,839
specialists because I can become a

890
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,520
specialist maybe not at like the perfect

891
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,359
level, right? But I can become a

892
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,960
specialist like pretty quickly in like 5

893
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,359
minutes on like a domain that I have

894
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,359
know nothing about, right? And maybe it

895
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,520
takes me now a month to study something

896
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,159
in very very like strong depth, but I

897
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,879
can do it, right? And if the quicker you

898
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,720
can become a specialist in something

899
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,639
that that ability right so it's not that

900
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,639
you are the specialist for this but the

901
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,960
quicker you can become the specialist

902
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,000
that's how we would reward how good you

903
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,520
are in your job

904
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:07,400
and the other aspect was from the like

905
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:10,880
we are doing one LP right of the ILP

906
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,079
that your innovation partners innovation

907
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,640
ideas You open it up for like the

908
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,480
software engineer engineers from you

909
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,000
know these different companies to come

910
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,440
and partner with you

911
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,200
students have that kind of understanding

912
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,160
and training on hand with them.

913
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,560
So this is a question for me. I thought

914
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,640
I was just the moderator. Um I mean

915
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,960
there there are something like 63

916
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,200
different uh entrepreneurship programs

917
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,040
and such that we we run with students

918
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,040
here at MIT. So, um, the answer is yes,

919
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,359
but there are many different ways for

920
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,760
you to engage with them. And I would,

921
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,040
um, I would, uh, suggest you talk to

922
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,200
Peter Brousard, who's your ILP program

923
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:59,119
director, about that type of, uh, type

924
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,960
of work. Um, so I I I hope that helps. I

925
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,280
feel like I'm punting out an answer, but

926
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,440
uh, it it really it requires, I think, a

927
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,160
detailed discussion to to do that. I was

928
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,599
trying to ask more general question but

929
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,920
in a more generic form right right now

930
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,320
if there is an innovation idea usually

931
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,200
MIT students are working on it right the

932
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,720
software engineers from my company could

933
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,480
come and participate in those innovation

934
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,079
time with those yeah like I said I I

935
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,240
think it's doing it justice is kind of

936
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,079
difficult off off the cuff but there

937
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,720
things like getting involved in capstone

938
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,800
projects X and you know then and those

939
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,920
happen really across the institute

940
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,440
whether it's Sloan and data analytics or

941
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,440
uh you know in in computer science uh

942
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,359
but I I I I would I would definitely

943
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,280
talk to uh Peter about that and uh I

944
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,280
think he'd be happy to those ideas.

945
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,480
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a great idea

946
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,400
and I know that yeah we we

947
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,320
we do that. I I could think of a few

948
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,440
different ways to answer that and

949
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,119
specific programs but uh absolutely.

950
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,119
Okay, we're going to take one more

951
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,280
question. Okay. Hi. So, I'm curious uh

952
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,960
to hear your thought about uh what do

953
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,359
you think about the interaction of

954
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,760
specific teams like talking about data

955
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,680
science teams versus software

956
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,920
engineering teams. Now with the

957
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,640
development of such you know there are a

958
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,200
lot of uh

959
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:32,079
abstractions like lchain like hagging

960
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,000
face like data science can do a lot more

961
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,119
but software engineering can do a lot

962
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,280
more too. So how do you see the teams

963
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,160
are changing now in terms of the scope

964
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,760
of the task and the interaction between

965
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,760
the two because you know in the past

966
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,200
traditionally data science teams were

967
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,280
more focused on data curation training

968
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,280
things like that and then they kind of

969
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
move it to the engineering team to scale

970
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,920
or

971
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,920
uh you know make it more robust but

972
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,680
today it's a bit different I feel so how

973
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,680
do you see it in your areas so in my

974
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,240
area I would they that they kind of

975
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,920
merging right you don't separate anymore

976
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,480
from just the data and the engineering

977
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,760
side cuz I mean I would say in the first

978
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,119
place it didn't make a lot of sense that

979
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,119
we did that I mean we did that because

980
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,640
we needed the specializations right um

981
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,000
to have people who are really good at

982
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,359
data science and people who are really

983
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
good at engineering and they couldn't do

984
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,680
both but at the end of the day we want

985
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,040
to solve a problem to focus on the

986
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,560
wholesome thing right so if we can have

987
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,680
people who can focus on both because

988
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,920
they get the support from the AI agents

989
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,440
where whatever we will be developing in

990
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,680
the future that I think is the way to

991
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,760
go. Yeah, I I would agree with that. I

992
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,320
see that more emerging right we see

993
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,320
software engineers need to do more

994
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,839
things with the data to understand

995
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,040
what's happening in the system you know

996
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,480
design experiments so that they

997
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,119
understand how things are performing

998
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,880
collect analyze it and so on. We need

999
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,839
the you know the data scientists as well

1000
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,920
kind of moving into um you know and

1001
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,400
merging more with the different uh you

1002
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,160
know spaces the data engineers the

1003
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,000
people who are maintaining and running

1004
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,680
infrastructure. So I think the good news

1005
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,839
is data science type skills needed kind

1006
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,520
of much more pervasively and in many

1007
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:17,599
more uh domains um uh not just you know

1008
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,760
kind of as a you know in many

1009
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,960
organization including IBM you know we

1010
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,599
had kind of our data science silo um and

1011
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,760
now it's it's really moving and emerging

1012
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,079
and embedding uh data scientists in all

1013
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:35,599
of these teams. I'm going to veer

1014
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:38,160
left. So that for my industry at least,

1015
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,640
we're a very highly regulated industry

1016
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,359
with dealing with a lot of health data.

1017
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,359
Um so data

1018
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:47,520
scientists working with actual realtime

1019
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,520
data is something that software

1020
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,760
engineers generally haven't had real

1021
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,520
access to in the past. they understand

1022
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,680
some of the context of it, but

1023
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,520
especially with like clinical analytics,

1024
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,680
you don't really have software engineers

1025
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,079
going in there and analyzing, but really

1026
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,200
having to understand like population

1027
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,040
health metrics for example. Um, so uh

1028
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,520
there's for us at least there's still

1029
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,520
sort of that separation between data

1030
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,000
science teams and software engineering

1031
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,079
teams. Um but there are other areas

1032
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,560
especially in terms of like customer

1033
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,240
relations and stuff like that that the

1034
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,960
teams are sort starting to merge but

1035
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,119
like our actual data science teams

1036
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,200
they're sort of still like locked away

1037
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,359
and they're operating as two separate

1038
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,119
verticals.

1039
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,560
Okay, I think we're uh going to wrap

1040
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,200
things up. Let's hear it for our

1041
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,800
panel. I I

1042
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,119
also before I forget I want to thank our

1043
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,480
AV people in the corner over here. I I

1044
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,599
think uh MIT

1045
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,280
audiovisisual you need to be a licensed

1046
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,200
therapist to take that because you put

1047
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,280
up with all my neurotic quest requests

1048
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,960
all morning. Uh just a couple of things.

1049
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,480
Uh we are going to have lunch now. So if

1050
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,480
you want to network with people

1051
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,119
hopefully you can now keep continue with

1052
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,800
the exchange of ideas. I wish this forum

1053
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,680
lasted a couple of days. It seems like

1054
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,560
there's enough content. We also uh are

1055
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,920
having in the afternoon the uh MIT

1056
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,800
startup exchange live demo day. So we we

1057
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,520
uh focused on getting startups that are

1058
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,119
uh in the AI area or AI adjacent. So

1059
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,000
it's a lot of great companies you can

1060
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,560
see actually doing real things. And then

1061
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,200
uh this is uh it's been kind of a secret

1062
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,680
to now but we we're bringing in a bunch

1063
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,920
of pizzas and beer at four o'clock. So

1064
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,400
if you want to hang out and network then

1065
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,240
it's um totally secret. We didn't uh

1066
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,480
have registration for that. The the

1067
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,520
password is pepperoni to to get into

1068
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,920
that. So uh and I hope a lot of you hang

1069
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:49,880
around and uh enjoy some pizza and beer

1070
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,880
with us. Thank you. Thanks so much.
