00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,319
morning

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:11,400
everybody Welcome to our Leading

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:15,240
Edge energy webinar series my name is CJ

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,520
gu a program director with the uh office

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,199
of cooperate relations at MIT as many of

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,840
you know uh our office has a industrial

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,720
leis program and a start exchange

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,560
platform uh through which we've been

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,640
helping hundreds of the world most

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,320
Innovation minded companies to access

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,640
mit's research Technologies startups and

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,440
an overall Boston

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,520
Cambridge Innovation Innovation

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,079
ecosystem now tackling the climate

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,120
change

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:58,160
challenges and promoting sustainable

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,920
development have very high priorities at

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,680
MIT and we know that

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:09,280
decarbonization is the in the core of

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,840
many or any corporations sust

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,520
sustainable development

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,920
initiatives especially so for companies

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,759
in the manufacturing

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,759
energy and uh other

25
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,439
sectors but decarbonization and

26
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:34,880
sustainable development are not just

27
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:37,119
setting goals and investing in R&D and

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,759
doing commercial

29
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,000
projects you also need to have a very

30
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:48,079
deep understanding on technology

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,479
options is

32
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,240
economics it's interplay between

33
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:58,079
Technology Solutions and policies and

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,799
ultimately the viability of your

35
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,719
Solutions or your options

36
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,719
in the real

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,160
world that's why we organize today's

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,840
webinar focus on

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,760
decarbonization and we've invited to

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,879
Leading researchers from

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,879
MIT Dr Amir

42
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:31,519
gansi and Dr Jennifer Morris to share

43
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,160
their deep insights with us in this very

44
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,879
important

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,959
domain as you know in MIT we

46
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,159
also not just doing research developing

47
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,360
technology we also developing generating

48
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,280
companies and

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,000
many people from MIT start their own

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,840
companies to move the research results

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,159
further into the real world to make a

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,400
positive impact so we also invite two

53
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,480
MIT connect connected

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,239
startups to demonstrate what they do in

55
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,760
these important directions after the

56
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:17,840
presentation of the uh of uh Dr GF and

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,959
uh more

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,080
Morris so you of course you obviously

59
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,159
you can

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,560
participate by submit your

61
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:32,159
questions using the Q&A tab at the

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,200
bottom of your screen and we'll try to

63
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,640
answer your questions as much as as much

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,720
as as we

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,560
can now with that uh please welcome our

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,239
first Speaker

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:54,200
today uh Dr Amir

68
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:58,599
janser Amir is the a principal research

69
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,400
scientist at mit's energy initiative and

70
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:06,799
he is also

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:10,599
the co-founder and CEO of company called

72
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,799
Sesame technology a great system

73
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:20,120
modeling platform for the Energy

74
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,919
System Amir take it over from here

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,600
please thank you CJ for the introduction

76
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,720
and thank you for the invitation to

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,880
speak uh with this group uh so like

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,919
today I will be speaking about the novel

79
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,639
systems analysis platform uh which is

80
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,720
Sesame uh that was the research that we

81
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,520
were conducting at MIT energy initiative

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,639
and as CJ mentioned now we also have a

83
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,560
startup commercializing these

84
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,680
Technologies so this uh software is uh

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,919
helping industrial companies to make

86
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,280
better decision in terms of their

87
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,759
decarbonization and today's topic will

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,160
be showing you what kind of Technology

89
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,199
we have developed and also applications

90
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,639
of these technology in Iron and Steel

91
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,360
and green hydrogen projects and also

92
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,160
combination of uh hydrogen and

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,520
steel so like I I I know everybody knows

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,080
but like just a brief motivation about

95
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,919
why we are focusing on Industrial

96
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,160
decarbonization when we look at

97
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,120
industrial and transportation sector

98
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,919
emissions they amount approximately 46%

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,720
of global ghg

100
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,800
emissions and like there is also a huge

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,319
cost involved with this around 15

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,240
trillion to decarbonize through

103
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,120
2050 and every company and every

104
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,319
government is really focusing on how we

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,600
can decarbonize these uh like Industries

106
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,039
and also how we can make it cost

107
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,160
effective uh and one of the key areas

108
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,479
that we see as a challenge is that uh

109
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,639
planning reporting and verification of

110
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,479
these is not trivial and currently

111
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
existing software or existing

112
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,840
capabilities really like industrial

113
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,199
knoow and that's the Gap we are trying

114
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,639
to

115
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,800
fill so I will briefly mention about

116
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,880
Sesame what we do like in the next three

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,520
slides and I will directly dive into the

118
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,000
uh case study that I want to share with

119
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,400
you so in terms of what we are doing at

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Sesame uh so this is a software platform

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,039
that brings together all modeling needs

122
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,840
for for portfolio decarbonization into a

123
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:34,240
single platform by this what I mean is

124
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,880
you need first principle process level

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,280
detailed models you need to understand

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,000
cost and emissions and in this emission

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,160
side it is basically life cycle

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,319
emissions throughout the life cycle of

129
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,400
these products uh you need to optimize

130
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,599
all these systems for location

131
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,199
technology options so and so forth and

132
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,199
of course depending on where you are uh

133
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,280
there might be some policy levs that

134
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,360
might benefit or uh selection of these

135
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,759
Technologies and all of these are

136
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,759
integrated to a single platform very

137
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,800
usable platform so that it can uh make

138
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,599
your decision making process easier and

139
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,680
also uh drive you with optimal

140
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,960
results and in terms of the type of

141
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,400
analysis that is required for energy

142
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,599
transition and decarbonization the first

143
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,440
one is really big picture comparison and

144
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,840
in this I mean like you have Supply

145
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,680
chains for whatever you product you are

146
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,440
producing from from whatever resources

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,800
you want to start and you will you need

148
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,479
to represent these Supply chains quite

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,479
of a uh in quite of a uh detail so like

150
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,960
how you resource your uh energy

151
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,800
resources how you transport store

152
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,039
convert to other uh forms so and so

153
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,759
forth and the first step is really

154
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,520
configuring these Supply chains and this

155
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,720
is where we have a very very flexible

156
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,240
platform so like we created hundreds of

157
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,479
modules that represent different

158
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,000
technology options and you can easily

159
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,560
configure Supply chains and customize

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,360
these based on your needs the second

161
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,599
piece which is key here is the analysis

162
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,400
which is a combination of cost and

163
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,479
Emissions analysis and traditionally

164
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,080
cost and Emissions analysis are uh

165
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,479
conducted separately and this has a main

166
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,560
problem of not having the same bases so

167
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,080
making Apples to Apples comparison

168
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,159
difficult and

169
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,719
by having everything in a single uh

170
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,560
consistent platform we are solving this

171
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,000
problem and you can see scope one to

172
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,240
three emissions as well as cost of the

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,160
product and finally to make the decision

174
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,600
you need a comparison metric and in

175
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,160
terms of decarbonization cost of CO2

176
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,240
avoided is the Natural Choice because it

177
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,240
combines cost and Emissions into a

178
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,920
single metric and then you can compare

179
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,079
all these different supply chain options

180
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,480
technology options and see what is

181
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:06,079
the best solution for your particular

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,240
case and the second type of analysis

183
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:11,560
which is critical for making good

184
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,839
decisions is how you will be optimizing

185
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,600
your projects in the renewable energy

186
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,640
resources Paradigm most of the

187
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,200
decarbonization efforts uses renewable

188
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,440
energy in one way or other and most

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,079
often we are really relying on

190
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,440
intermittent resources such as solar and

191
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,920
wind and the integration of these

192
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,160
resources are very region dependent as

193
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,160
well as uh process dependent so for most

194
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,000
industrial applications you need steady

195
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,079
state feed stock whether it is hydrogen

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,079
or power and the processes are not

197
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:49,760
really designed to be operated at a

198
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:52,079
variable load so this of course creates

199
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,360
a challenge because either you need to

200
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:57,720
uh like overbuild these to produce more

201
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,040
when these resources are available and

202
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,200
store your product or integrate uh uh

203
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,920
energy storage options like batteries

204
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,640
and to be able to do that you really

205
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,880
need to have a very sophisticated

206
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,040
optimization capability uh that will be

207
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,480
giving you renewable uh sizing as well

208
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,519
as design choices for every location of

209
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,600
interest and that's the second area that

210
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,279
uh like we have integrated in our

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,079
platform and then you will see in

212
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,120
examples how these are used uh and how

213
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:35,120
these can actually give very interesting

214
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,320
insights now as I promised I'm Switching

215
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,079
gears towards a detailed example uh and

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,160
I will start with Iron and Steel uh so

217
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,079
Iron and Steel is particularly

218
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,519
interesting because uh first of all it

219
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,680
is a uh like a very emission intensive

220
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,000
uh process So currently around 7% of

221
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,880
global emissions are sourced from Iron

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,200
and Steel uh

223
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,959
manufacturing uh and secondly uh the we

224
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,839
expect a major growth in the production

225
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,279
of Iron and Steel because of uh more

226
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,480
urbanization having buildings relying on

227
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,200
steel so on so

228
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,720
forth uh and when we currently look into

229
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,600
the production it is mostly uh in China

230
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,240
followed by uh like many other countries

231
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,000
and today's discussions will be India

232
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,519
and Us in this context because both have

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,399
different characterist characteristics

234
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:35,200
that makes the kind of analysis quite

235
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,079
interesting so why Iron and Steel is a

236
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,600
hard to Abate sector uh it is mostly

237
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:45,399
relying on fossil resources currently

238
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,320
and there are two main uh sources of CO2

239
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,880
emissions that we see and here this is a

240
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,279
schematic of blast furnace uh and uh

241
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,000
like this figure is from uh like Sydney

242
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,680
Johnson's PhD

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,040
CIS uh so what you see here here is that

244
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,720
there are mainly two sources of CO2 one

245
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,639
is combustion of uh coal or other fuels

246
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,480
that you use to be able to uh produce

247
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,160
heat uh that will be helping the running

248
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,480
the reaction and the second one is uh

249
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,680
reduction of iron step so for the

250
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,639
reduction of iron uh when you reduce uh

251
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,800
iron uh so you also release some CO2

252
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:32,240
basically you really need to be able to

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:35,519
decarbonize these two sources to uh get

254
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,360
as low as CO2 as

255
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,639
possible how can we decarbonize so this

256
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,120
is the main question that we are asking

257
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,720
for all the sectors and Iron and Steel

258
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,199
is again a

259
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,519
interesting example because we have all

260
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:53,560
three options that is mostly discussed

261
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:57,440
in the industrial decarbonization uh

262
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:01,279
concept so one is fuel switching uh so

263
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,440
today mostly uh steel production relies

264
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,360
on coal and switching to lower carbon

265
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,079
fuels uh including natural gas uh even

266
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,120
though it's fossil fuel it has lower CO2

267
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:17,480
content uh low carbon hydrogen or

268
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,000
biomass bofes can reduce the emissions

269
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,680
and in this case it can be a combination

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,639
of continuing using existing technology

271
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,959
by Fuel switching or also adding new

272
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,480
technologies to further reduce the

273
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,560
emissions because as we've discussed in

274
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
the previous slide so it is not only

275
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,600
about the fuel source but the reduction

276
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,079
steps also uh create some

277
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,880
emissions the second option is uh

278
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,279
continue using fossil Resources with or

279
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,760
without fuel switching and uh introduce

280
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,680
carbon capture and storage in this case

281
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,360
uh like in addition to adding carbon

282
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,839
capture you also have choices whether it

283
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,240
will be a post combustion chemical uh

284
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,680
capture or it will be combustion if you

285
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,880
are uh like making your fuel uh zero

286
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,440
emission or low emission and it can be

287
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,079
physical absorption base such as uh or

288
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,519
absorption based such as mea so and so

289
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,639
forth it can also be cryogenic capture

290
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,560
and the third option which is usually

291
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:25,000
the most expensive option is uh retiring

292
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,440
your existing plants and then changing

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,360
Technologies so here there are different

294
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,600
Technologies so you can switch PL from

295
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,759
blast furnace to uh direct reduced iron

296
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,639
options but also there are new

297
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:42,079
technologies coming into the market such

298
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,399
as molten oxide electrolyzers or uh that

299
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,800
will be helping with the smelting

300
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,880
reduction and there are some commercial

301
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,759
Technologies corex and hisna which is

302
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,320
based on these

303
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,360
Concepts so now I will directly go into

304
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,519
the results to compare these options and

305
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,240
provide some uh insights about what can

306
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,800
be

307
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,600
done the first uh like the first before

308
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,920
the results I just want to also show you

309
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,399
why we are focusing in India India is

310
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,240
like of course like as a like growing

311
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,800
economy and uh like the production of

312
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,160
Iron and Steel and other Industrial

313
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,560
Products will be quite important in the

314
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,079
coming years and when we look at the

315
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,199
projections India steel sector uh is

316
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,880
expected to increase production by

317
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,680
million tons uh by 2030 so it is a very

318
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,480
short period of time to significantly

319
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,440
increase the uh total production

320
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,160
level and India is also coming with a

321
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,199
specific challenge because when we look

322
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,839
at the emission intensity of uh steel

323
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,800
Pro manufactured or produced in India

324
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,800
its average carbon intensity is around

325
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,360
2.3 ton of CO2 per ton of Steel and this

326
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,279
is uh significantly higher than the

327
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,680
global average which is 1.8 T CO2 per

328
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,319
ton steel uh and currently it is mostly

329
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,120
coal based both for blast furnaces as

330
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,800
well as the direct reduced uh reduction

331
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,839
of iron and it really opens up all the

332
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,959
cap uh all the options that we discussed

333
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,600
in the previous uh slide so like it can

334
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,480
be a combination of using carbon

335
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:30,240
captures fuel switching or Bol to make

336
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:32,480
these uh emission intensity lower

337
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,079
so as you can see in this slide there

338
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,560
are many different options uh and these

339
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,440
options are shown on the left hand side

340
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,319
including Blast Furnace uh direct

341
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,199
reduced iron as well as the new

342
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:46,800
technologies of uh smelting Technologies

343
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,600
like corex and

344
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:55,160
hna and currently ER India relies on the

345
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,600
red box Technologies coal based direct

346
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,639
reduced iron and blast furnace using

347
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:05,319
coal so the emission intensities as you

348
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:09,120
can see are uh around 2.4 to 2.7 ton CO2

349
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:12,559
uh per ton of uh steel now we can you

350
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,880
can see there is a big uh range of

351
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,480
results here uh so depending on the

352
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,600
exact technology that's used but you can

353
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,280
see like whatever uh the decision is you

354
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,919
are always reducing emissions so

355
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,199
actually this is a good uh First Step

356
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,799
because like any technology change fuel

357
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,559
switching will end up uh improving the

358
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,440
emission intensity of uh the techn the

359
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,640
steel

360
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,919
manufacturing and if we start with the

361
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,760
best option in terms of emissions it is

362
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,720
switching to Green hydrogen direct

363
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,440
reduce iron so in this case uh the

364
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,840
emission intensity can be reduced by 81

365
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,200
to

366
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,320
84% relative to traditional co-based

367
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,559
Pathways and this is of course a

368
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,919
significant emission reduction uh and

369
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,840
just to remind you in this slide we are

370
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,320
only focusing on emission so like the

371
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,120
best solution is of course the solution

372
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,280
that will give us uh the highest

373
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,240
emission reduction and with this it also

374
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,320
uh we need to remind ourselves that

375
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,520
there are multiple questions here one is

376
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,240
how much it will cost the second one is

377
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:23,039
can we really do that uh like what are

378
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,600
supply chain uh challenges we might be

379
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,600
overseeing so on and so forth and all of

380
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,799
these will be addressed in the upcoming

381
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,240
slides uh but let's keep our Hope High

382
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,360
and say okay so if we are able to switch

383
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,600
to Green hydrogen we can have a

384
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,880
significant emission reduction and that

385
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,280
can be one of the cleanest uh hydrogen

386
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,600
production options uh that's available

387
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,679
the second option is adding carbon

388
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,559
capture uh so in this case if we include

389
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,919
carbon capture uh so it can reduce

390
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,600
emissions by

391
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:00,240
70% and that's also significant emission

392
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,320
reduction and so you can see in this

393
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,240
graph as well as uh the uh like the

394
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,240
other CCS options so this is uh quite

395
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,480
interesting and quite doable uh so the

396
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,880
main challenge for that is of course how

397
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,280
are we retrofitting these plants and the

398
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,440
second question that comes is what

399
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,120
carbon capture technology we use and

400
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,960
with what fuel we are uh powering these

401
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,280
carbon capture uh plants and the third

402
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,159
option that we see here which is quite

403
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,240
interesting is the uh direct reduced

404
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:36,720
iron uh so if we use natural gas based

405
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,440
drri so you can immediately cut down

406
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
emissions by

407
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,760
uh

408
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,760
70% and if you add ccs to that it will

409
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,520
further reduce emissions and so here

410
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,600
basically we have kind of compared all

411
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,640
these options uh and as you can see

412
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,080
these are quite detailed in terms of the

413
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,159
fuel use uh like byproduct uh

414
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,280
composition and as well as the

415
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,240
electricity input so on so forth and by

416
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,799
doing this sort of analysis for a

417
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,760
particular region and particular

418
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,880
industry you can easily compare

419
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,400
different options that might be viable

420
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,280
or that might not be viable and as I

421
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,919
mentioned for this particular slide

422
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,520
emission intensity is the only metric

423
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:25,200
but there are many other questions to be

424
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,120
asked uh and some of these answers will

425
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,039
be actually different than uh based on

426
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,880
the metric of

427
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:37,240
interest and in the case of uh cost

428
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,640
which is the real pain Point uh

429
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:46,240
so what we see here is that whatever we

430
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:50,120
switch to uh we see a seven like 5 to

431
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,120
75% increase in the cost of Steel

432
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,440
products and of course this is a quite

433
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:00,640
steep uh increase uh and we know there

434
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,480
is a penalty for uh most of the

435
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,400
decarbonization uh Pathways and in this

436
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,480
case uh switching from coal to any other

437
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,440
options uh will increase the cost by 5

438
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,760
to

439
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:18,000
75% so here uh I think the first uh bar

440
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,039
that will be probably uh getting

441
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,919
everyone's attention is the green

442
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:25,240
hydrogen so in this graph on the left

443
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,799
hand side we have the cost of Steel

444
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,640
which is uh represented as dollar per

445
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,480
ton of

446
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,480
steel and on the right hand side we have

447
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,960
the emission intensity so basically

448
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,000
these are the results from the previous

449
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,520
result slide and green hydrogen had the

450
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,279
lowest emission as you can see from the

451
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,000
uh dot here uh but it also has the

452
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:52,080
highest cost so like it is

453
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,279
73% uh like it is uh it has a

454
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,240
73% cost increase relative to Coal based

455
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:01,559
direct reduced iron and this is as you

456
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,600
can relative to other options is a uh it

457
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,960
might be prohibitively expensive but in

458
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,120
this particular uh slide and I I on

459
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,720
purpose included this there are other

460
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,279
questions that we will be asking so

461
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,760
what's the cost of green hydrogen where

462
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,840
do you produce these how do you handle

463
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,880
intermittency so and so forth and all of

464
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,000
these will be answered in the upcoming

465
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,279
slides uh but for one snapshot results

466
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,039
this is one snapshot and representative

467
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,720
results this is the uh

468
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,919
where the cost stands relative to other

469
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,440
options and the second one is the use of

470
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,960
carbon capture and in this case we are

471
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,559
looking into

472
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,679
mea based carbon capture and in this

473
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:51,840
case they increase the uh cost by

474
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:55,039
48% relative to blast furnace and uh mea

475
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,159
based carbon capture uh presents the uh

476
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,039
more expensive CCS options here so as

477
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:05,640
you can see we have included other

478
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:09,840
Technologies like selexol and use of uh

479
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,400
uh other PSA options vpsa and then uh

480
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,320
relative to all of these other options

481
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,720
uh it has the highest cost uh and

482
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,720
another interesting result we've seen is

483
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,840
that one of the Technologies new

484
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,400
technologies which is the using selting

485
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,480
reduction technology might actually be

486
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,000
cheaper than the current uh Tech

487
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,960
technology which is blast fors so again

488
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,120
so this results should be all always

489
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,600
taken with a grant of salt because these

490
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,640
are new technologies and the commercial

491
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,080
deployment might might be different so

492
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,520
and so forth but there is at least a

493
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,880
possibility that there will be a

494
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,559
decarbonization solution which will also

495
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,520
reduce cost and these kind of solutions

496
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,000
are great because you are not only

497
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,760
reducing emissions but also you are uh

498
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,880
cost saving so actually that can uh

499
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,360
motivate companies governments to really

500
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,320
push towards these Technologies as soon

501
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,520
as

502
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,240
possible uh but of course we need to

503
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,120
also take into account that the emission

504
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,400
reduction is uh like quite High relative

505
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,480
to basis but in terms of the total

506
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,400
emission uh intensity of Steel so it it

507
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,320
is much higher than other options that

508
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,480
we see in the uh CCS pain or uh the

509
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,640
green hydrogen

510
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,039
cases and finally as we briefly

511
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,880
mentioned in the first couple of slides

512
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:34,440
the comparison metrix in these cases is

513
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,679
cost of CO2

514
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,480
avoided and in this case uh like

515
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,039
basically we have compared all these

516
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,399
options uh in terms of uh relative to

517
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:51,720
blast furnace option and as you can

518
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:55,799
see uh some of these options are quite

519
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,440
uh cheap so and in the higher case

520
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:03,000
smelting reduction case actually it is

521
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:06,880
is uh cheaper than the uh Benchmark

522
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,960
option uh but some Alternatives like uh

523
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,440
green hydrogen or use of CCS for uh

524
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,720
blast furnace in terms of cost of CO2

525
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,640
avoided can be higher and I think

526
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,640
there's one interesting results that you

527
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,159
will see here even though green hydrogen

528
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:28,720
case was the most expensive solution in

529
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:31,799
terms of uh the uh

530
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,080
cost of Steel manufactured in terms of

531
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,559
cost of CO2 avoided it is not the most

532
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,960
expensive option and this is uh because

533
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:43,039
the emission reduction you achieved by

534
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,360
switching to Green hydrogen is more than

535
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,360
80% uh and the combined impact of cost

536
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,240
and Emissions is reflected in this graph

537
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,679
and as you can see like adding carbon

538
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,840
capture to existing blast furnace is

539
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,360
actually a much more expensive option

540
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,320
than switching to any other options or

541
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,880
even using green

542
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,039
hydrogen and this is a quite important

543
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,120
metric to use to compare these options

544
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:11,840
because ultimately our goal is really to

545
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,640
reduce emissions as much as possible to

546
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,640
get to uh our climate

547
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,880
goals so now uh like we've discussed

548
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,240
quite a bit about hydrogen green

549
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,760
hydrogen Pathways and how it can be

550
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,039
potentially interesting for the uh

551
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,080
emission uction in the steel industry so

552
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,440
now of course we need to really focus on

553
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,720
how can we optimize green hydrogen

554
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,799
production and just a brief definition

555
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,320
of what is green hydrogen green hydrogen

556
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:48,080
is basically hydrogen produced from

557
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,520
Renewable Power ER combined with

558
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,840
electrolyzers so by definition we are

559
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,880
relying on renewable energy sources and

560
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,840
renewable energy sources are

561
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,480
intermittently available and these uh

562
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,960
Vari abilities exists both day today

563
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,360
hour to hour but also there is a major

564
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,960
difference between season to season and

565
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,360
all of these kind of uh variabilities

566
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,200
intermittencies needs to be taken into

567
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,080
account when we are designing systems uh

568
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,159
to produce whatever product we are

569
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,320
interested using these options and just

570
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,320
as a reference here I have included a

571
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,880
solar PV profile and a onshore wind

572
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,080
profile uh so you can see for a one day

573
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,840
rep representative day for solar we have

574
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,399
around 5 hours or so solar energy so we

575
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,520
really need to produce whatever we need

576
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,799
to produce during this period of time

577
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,519
and for onshore wind the profile is a

578
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:44,799
little bit different depending on where

579
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:48,320
you are depending on the season uh but

580
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,960
it might have wider hours of uh wind

581
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,919
availability and then then you might see

582
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,240
actually multiple days of no wind

583
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,200
blowing at all and there are many

584
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,039
strategies to combine these uh resources

585
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,080
so it doesn't need to be really relying

586
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:07,320
on one uh and for that particular uh

587
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,039
study we are taking a sophisticated

588
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,000
optimization approach and in this

589
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:16,600
approach we are uh optimizing the

590
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,360
deployment of renewable assets as well

591
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,279
as

592
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,760
electrolyzers their

593
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,120
sizing uh in a single uh optimization

594
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,679
model and by doing that we are trying to

595
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,039
use all these resources to together to

596
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,159
increase the capacity factor of

597
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,320
electrolyzers or in return to come up

598
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,640
with the minimal cost uh optimal uh

599
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,120
levelized cost of

600
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,039
hydrogen and so if everything was

601
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,960
similar to Fossil resources where you

602
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,320
can just turn on Renewables and then use

603
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,640
uh that energy for whatever purpose you

604
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,720
need uh we can just connect Renewables

605
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,279
to electrolyzers and we can produce

606
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,960
hydrogen that will be uh meeting a

607
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,640
constant demand uh for industrial

608
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,039
applications but because of the profiles

609
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,320
that we just discussed we need to

610
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,559
include some uh options here and there

611
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,480
are mainly two options one is including

612
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,480
batteries so when you or energ any type

613
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,240
of energy storage when you produce

614
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,000
electricity from Renewables uh store

615
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,279
some of that electricity to be used

616
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
later to uh continuously Supply hydrogen

617
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,120
or you you can overbuild both renewable

618
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,279
capacity as well as electrolyzer

619
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,600
capacity to produce more of the product

620
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,200
in this case hydrogen uh when the

621
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,399
Renewables are available and then store

622
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,039
hydrogen and then make sure that you

623
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:48,519
still have the constant Supply uh to

624
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:52,720
meet the demand from industrial

625
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,480
facilities so we have performed many of

626
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,480
these type of analysis and what we've

627
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,240
seen is currently battery technologies

628
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,360
are prohibitively expensive so so like

629
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,600
even if we include in the uh

630
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,159
optimization the model never picks

631
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,960
batteries uh with current and projected

632
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:13,080
near-term cost so that's why we can

633
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,760
eliminate that uh for the uh making

634
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,440
these a little bit simpler optimization

635
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,320
problem and then we can focus on the

636
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:25,720
including hydrogen storage uh to make

637
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,559
these uh system work and Supply uh

638
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,360
steady state hydrogen

639
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,200
so I will I will be giving uh examples

640
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,880
from two regions uh and like our

641
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,640
capabilities and also many analysis we

642
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,519
have done actually is much more granular

643
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,840
than that so we can really do zip code

644
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,240
level analysis for the entire Globe uh

645
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,720
and this particular case study has been

646
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,600
actually performed for a recent study by

647
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,000
uh National Petroleum Council uh like

648
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,120
looking at the future of hydrogen in the

649
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,120
us context and all these results are

650
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,919
available in the report and we are more

651
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,960
than happy to share that report it's in

652
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,120
the public

653
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,880
domain but for the uh demonstration

654
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,120
purposes uh so like I will be looking

655
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,360
into comparison between West Coast and

656
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,080
Gulf Coast and these are two US regions

657
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,080
and on the right hand side you can see

658
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,480
the current uh hydrogen demand in these

659
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:27,799
uh locations so G Coast is uh is the

660
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,559
basically Hub of most the refineries as

661
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:32,240
a as well as other chemical uh

662
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:36,440
production facilities not surprisingly

663
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:40,600
we see a major uh consumption of

664
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:43,240
hydrogen uh which is around 5.8 million

665
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,279
tons per year and in the west coast

666
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,320
there are some refiner operations and

667
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,240
some chemical plants and also West Coast

668
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,159
is uh the there's the highest number of

669
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,279
hydrogen fuel of electric vehicles in

670
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,360
the US and you will see so the total

671
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:02,720
demand today is around 1 million tons

672
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:06,080
per year so uh now we will be looking at

673
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,159
the cost of these two options and why uh

674
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,519
we see a major cost difference uh when

675
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:16,480
we optimize these two systems so just to

676
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:20,159
start with uh so the tot to today's cost

677
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,679
of hydrogen from uh natural gas based

678
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,919
production is around $ and if you add

679
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,480
one1 to $1 and half dollar and when you

680
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,159
add carbon capture uh to reduce

681
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,919
emissions by 90

682
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,519
95% the cost can go up to $2 or so so

683
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,480
here in this case when we optimize

684
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,240
everything as you can see the cost of

685
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,760
green hydrogen at the production side is

686
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,960
around

687
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,480
5.7 per kilogram of hydrogen in the Gulf

688
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,639
Coast and it's around $7.2 per kilogram

689
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,399
of hydrogen in the west coast and uh you

690
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:58,720
will see this is like capex this

691
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,799
includes both renewable assets as well

692
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,760
as

693
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:07,000
electrolyzers uh contributes quite a bit

694
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:09,200
in both cases and the second uh piece is

695
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,919
the power cost which is the solar and

696
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,320
wind cost in this case so basically this

697
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:18,519
is mostly driven by uh renewable assets

698
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,880
as well as the expensive electrolyzer uh

699
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,600
deployment for these locations to

700
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,240
produce green clean

701
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,799
hydrogen so key Tes from this analysis

702
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,200
so we the uh like levelized cost of

703
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:35,639
hydrogen uh being around $1 and half per

704
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,559
kg of hydrogen more expensive in the

705
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:42,279
west cost and for the key drivers for

706
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,679
that it is the tradeoff between

707
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:48,559
electrolyzer capacity factor and power

708
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:52,799
cost so this is clearly seen in the

709
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,919
relative contribution of electr capex

710
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,279
and power costs so if the capacity

711
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:01,000
factor of uh renewable assets

712
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:04,159
were same exactly the same with Gulf

713
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,440
Coast we will see that actually relative

714
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:11,200
to capex of electrolyzers we should see

715
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,760
a similar uh capex in the uh power

716
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,320
system but we don't see it and the

717
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,359
reason for that is that for these two

718
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,679
regions uh the renewable availability

719
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,720
renewable resource availability is quite

720
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,760
different in the west coast first of all

721
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,200
it is mostly relying on solar uh solar

722
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,839
availability is great but solar

723
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:36,399
resources are also very intermittently

724
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,879
available and this having only few hours

725
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,679
a day available mean you need to

726
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,679
significantly oversize these assets uh

727
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,280
whenever you are building uh renew like

728
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:51,919
solar based uh chemical production

729
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,879
facilities ER and another advantage of

730
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,920
Golf Coast we see here is that the huge

731
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,920
uh potential in Wind resources so wind

732
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,200
capacity factor is not only High here

733
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,000
but also solar availability is quite

734
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,320
competitive with West so in GF cost

735
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,880
basically there is a combination of

736
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,200
complementary solar and wind resources

737
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,000
that really makes this location very

738
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,720
favorable to produce green hydrogen or

739
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,400
any type of uh green power Renewable

740
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,640
Power based uh

741
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,000
products uh and what we see in these

742
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,960
cases so like for the especially solar

743
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,880
relevant uh energy production so we

744
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:43,359
increase the generation of solar uh

745
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,520
electricity uh during the day so that we

746
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,480
can use the electrolyzers at highest

747
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,319
capacity Factor as possible and produce

748
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,839
as much hydrogen as possible during

749
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:55,680
these period of time and the reason we

750
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,200
see this kind of increase in the power

751
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,560
cost is actually coming from this

752
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,280
because you you are significantly

753
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,480
oversizing your Renewables uh to be able

754
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:10,680
to get every uh like light of sun as

755
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:14,079
well as you convert that into green

756
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,240
hydrogen and like in this approach the

757
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,599
first approach that we've didn't we have

758
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,440
done we have used kind of an average

759
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,400
capacity Factor uh for these locations

760
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,640
uh to optimize the entire system but the

761
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,839
problem is a little bit more

762
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,800
sophisticated than that because uh as we

763
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:36,400
mentioned initially so all of these

764
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:41,240
resources are extremely region dependent

765
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,480
so even like the big uh map we had for

766
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,680
West Coast and Gulf Coast is covering so

767
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,400
many different

768
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,000
regions and we see when we look into

769
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,800
this data you see a difference uh from

770
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,240
One Mile Square to Other M Square so

771
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,880
another uh way of doing these sort of

772
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,160
anal is really taking into account the

773
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,040
capacity factors at a very high temporal

774
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,560
and geospacial

775
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,079
resolution and in this case for uh

776
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,160
demonstration purposes we will be

777
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,400
looking into GF coast and here uh I

778
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,079
plotted uh like different capacity

779
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,280
factors in terms of wind solar geologic

780
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:23,319
storage which is another key driver for

781
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,160
uh the cost of hydrogen because you need

782
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:31,800
to also store these uh hydrogen resource

783
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:34,960
hydrogen products to be able to use in

784
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,880
whenever the demand is and then uh like

785
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,680
now we can take a much more granular

786
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,280
approach and then take these entire uh

787
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:48,040
regions and make it into different

788
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,280
nodes and the second question is how do

789
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,240
we optimize the entire system and the

790
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,319
entire network so here uh we have we

791
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,880
know all the available resources as well

792
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:01,720
as we know all the demand not so where

793
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,880
this hydrogen will be supplied to

794
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:08,480
produce whatever the end product we are

795
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,280
interested in and by doing this so we uh

796
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,760
create a multinodal optimization problem

797
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,880
where uh the we give all this

798
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,640
information to the model and then the

799
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,680
model picks where to build uh renewable

800
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,680
projects as well as electrolyzers and

801
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,839
how it can be deployed and transmitted

802
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,200
and in this case what you see is by

803
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,880
doing this

804
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,079
optimization uh the realistic cost of

805
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,400
delivered hydrogen and again so this is

806
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,400
delivered hydrogen and in the previous

807
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,560
graphs we were focusing only on the

808
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,880
production can go up to $6.1 uh dollar

809
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,280
per kilogram of hydrogen and what we see

810
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,640
here is that the model picks one region

811
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,319
to really produce all the hydrogen and

812
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,839
then all the electricity and most of the

813
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:59,319
hydrogen and then uh with red arrows it

814
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,200
uh picks a building a hydrogen pipeline

815
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:04,280
to cost effectively deliver these

816
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,160
hydrogen to the Final locations and in

817
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,599
some locations uh send the electricity

818
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:15,000
via the blue lines uh to produce

819
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,680
hydrogen for smaller demands uh at the

820
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,400
location of demand so that actually you

821
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,240
can see there's a tradeoff here so if

822
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,560
the demand is very high it's better to

823
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,599
produce hydrogen in a central location

824
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:29,880
and invest in pipelines versus if the uh

825
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,640
demand is relatively low it might be

826
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,440
more cost effective to uh produce

827
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,960
electricity stand that electricity and

828
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,920
produce hydrogen near the demand

829
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,359
site so in terms of key finding so like

830
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,440
we what we haven't discussed is like

831
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,760
there's an important trade-off between

832
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,040
the storage capability so if the storage

833
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,119
is uh available geologic storage that

834
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,040
makes the cost of hydrogen quite cheap

835
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,960
in all of these example what we've seen

836
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,760
is with inflation uction act and 45 F

837
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,000
tax credit actually green hydrogen can

838
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:08,079
be competitive with the

839
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,119
uh uh natural gas based options uh it is

840
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,359
still slightly higher uh at a slightly

841
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,000
higher cost when you include tax credit

842
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,920
but it might be competitive and green

843
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,680
hydrogen requires transport so like it

844
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,400
either it will be transmission or

845
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,920
transport we really need to take this

846
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,000
into account when we are doing these

847
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,319
sorts of analysis and in the final two

848
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,760
slides I will combine the discussion of

849
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:36,079
green hydrogen in Iron and Steel so we

850
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,560
we took an approach in India to compare

851
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,560
different technology options but when we

852
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,400
take a regional uh analysis stand so we

853
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,119
can really look into the US Fleet and

854
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,880
now that we also have all the tools and

855
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,800
uh necessary to be able to optimize the

856
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,760
green hydrogen availability and pro

857
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,960
capability so now we are uh taking this

858
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,440
approach to overlap the need for uh

859
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,760
emission reduction in US steel Fleet and

860
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,400
how we can make sure that we can do it

861
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,119
cost effectively so here we we are again

862
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,800
like using this inflation reduction tax

863
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,800
credits ER to compare these uh options

864
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,240
especially on the green hydrogen side

865
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,119
and here I have included two scenarios

866
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,880
one is uh without credit without tax

867
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,880
credit and the second one is with

868
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
extended tax credit that will include

869
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,960
the

870
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,359
um uh green hydrogen uh that will be

871
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,520
used in the Iron and Steel sector so in

872
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,240
terms of annual greenhouse gas emissions

873
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,640
from all the plans that you've seen uh

874
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,880
if we have uh the extension of uh

875
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,800
inflation reduction at tax credit we see

876
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,280
a lower emissions total

877
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,040
emissions uh and this is not

878
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,920
insignificant so you can see close to uh

879
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,160
30% reduction in total emissions and in

880
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,240
terms of cost actually

881
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,160
it is it might be slightly lower in

882
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:08,119
terms of the delivered cost of Steel and

883
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,480
on the bottom row what we see is that

884
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:13,280
whether we have credit or no credit

885
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,200
actually we see a massive change in the

886
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:20,559
production mix so in the case of there's

887
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:24,119
no credit we rely on mostly e electric

888
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,800
Arc furnace and also uh natural gas

889
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:31,680
based direct reduce iron uh but if the

890
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,559
there is uh extended tax credit then we

891
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,880
see that all the natural gas based

892
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,240
direct reduced iron is actually

893
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,839
switching to Green hydrogen because it

894
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,920
is both cost effective and also it

895
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,319
significantly reduce emissions relative

896
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,640
to other options so with that I will

897
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:49,559
conclude with these key takeaways so

898
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,119
whatever we do we really need detailed

899
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,240
cost and Emissions analysis and this is

900
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,359
quite challenging because in addition to

901
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,119
doing this kind of analysis for every

902
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:00,640
project we need to also take into

903
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:03,240
account new uncertainties with emerging

904
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,960
Technologies and implementation of the

905
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,319
Technologies for different

906
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,280
assets uh so the main challenge what we

907
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:15,079
see here is that we need to integrate uh

908
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,040
many conventional not connected energy

909
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,280
sub sector so this includes power

910
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,319
hydrogen so on and so forth and this

911
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,200
requires adapting a systems analysis

912
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:25,079
approach and this is what I really try

913
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,839
to show you with these examples that it

914
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,160
is actually a very multi-layer approach

915
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,599
and you really need to have everything

916
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,520
otherwise you will be making suboptimal

917
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:39,000
decisions Regional analysis is very

918
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,319
important and f one final key Point

919
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,200
whatever we do the first response is it

920
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,920
depends and then we really need to do

921
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,000
these all these detailed analysis and we

922
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,800
will see there's no silver blot that

923
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,400
will solve all our problems uh for

924
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,559
different regions different technology

925
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,880
options I'll stop here and uh back to

926
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,720
you CJ I think we are opening up for the

927
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,640
Q&A yeah yeah thanks Emir as great

928
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,240
analysis and great presentation and we

929
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,640
do have some good questions as well uh

930
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:15,760
the first one is uh how do you think of

931
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:19,800
the idea of replacing natural gas with

932
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,680
biomethane in in the steel

933
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,119
decarbonization uh

934
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,839
Direction yeah actually that's one of

935
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,559
the uh interesting option so it can be

936
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,040
either biomethane or renewable natural

937
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,160
gas and it can reduce emissions so of

938
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,160
course as we mentioned in the earlier

939
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,680
slide so like if you start with a carbon

940
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,960
containing fuel you will always have

941
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,000
some emissions uh but if it is sourced

942
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,880
by biobased or renewable uh based

943
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,640
sources or renewable natural gas which

944
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,440
is basically the today's uh the

945
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:02,720
emissions coming from mostly uh Solid

946
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,599
Waste or uh like farms uh so that

947
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,119
provides the emission reduction and I

948
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:10,520
think another good option using direct

949
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:14,720
reduced iron is down the line you can

950
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:18,720
also change switch to Green hydrogen or

951
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,640
uh sources that doesn't contain uh CO2

952
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,319
so I think that's one of the interesting

953
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,280
options and we have that analysis as

954
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:28,119
well I haven't included here but it's

955
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,520
also published so like we can also share

956
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:34,359
the publication uh with the person

957
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:37,240
asking the question okay great uh the

958
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:42,000
second question uh uh do you do you know

959
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:45,760
any uh pilot projects of uh steel making

960
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,559
with ccs that shows some

961
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,520
promises so I know projects but I

962
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,000
haven't seen anything that is already

963
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,000
deployed so like I know there are a

964
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,240
number of projects that has been

965
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
considered uh but I don't have a data

966
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,880
point where it is uh currently uh ready

967
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,200
to be used and we are collecting

968
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:12,960
data okay uh third question uh uh can

969
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,640
you discuss the hydrogen losses uh in

970
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,240
storage and

971
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,960
transmission yeah so that's a great

972
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,240
question so in terms of hydrogen uh

973
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,359
losses uh so hydrogen is a very small

974
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,800
molecule and it is even harder uh to

975
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:31,079
keep it relative to natural gas and when

976
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,839
we think about natural gas pipelines we

977
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:37,440
know that there is a couple of percent

978
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,680
uh leakage uh from these pipelines and

979
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,160
we expect that actually hydrogen will

980
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,480
have a little bit higher leakages uh due

981
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,599
to the being even smaller molecule and

982
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,480
for storage as well so for geologic

983
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:57,359
storage uh we assume uh certain daily ER

984
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,839
like in our analysis some daily ER

985
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,640
like uh

986
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:05,160
discharge uh and eventually that might

987
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:07,720
be quite big if uh we are really

988
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,839
switching to a hydrogen based Energy

989
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,680
System and I think secondary question to

990
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:16,240
that is the potential Global like global

991
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,400
warming potential impact of hydrogen and

992
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,880
if we have hydrogen as a molecule and if

993
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,440
we see more leakages more emissions of

994
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,160
hydrogen whether this will cause uh like

995
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,720
other uh negative impacts in terms of

996
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,480
climate change

997
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:34,520
uh so the short answer is like this is

998
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:38,040
still uh like a uh area of active

999
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:41,280
research so like many people including

1000
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,359
uh couple of professors at MIT studying

1001
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,880
actually the potential impact of

1002
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,079
hydrogen leakages and emissions and what

1003
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:52,480
they have seen is that its impact really

1004
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:55,200
increases in with the increasing amount

1005
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,680
of meane emissions so actually it makes

1006
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,000
hydrogen emissions make maintain more

1007
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,200
potent in terms of global warming

1008
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,200
potential uh so all of these are

1009
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:09,880
concerns and in our modeling we take

1010
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:12,480
into account these uh leakages and uh

1011
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,599
potential emissions uh but the next

1012
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,680
level about like the their potential

1013
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,800
Global uh warming potential uh we

1014
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,400
haven't included anything in these

1015
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,440
analysis

1016
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,079
Okay one minute but uh I'm going to

1017
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,480
combine this two questions uh one is do

1018
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:34,599
you have similar analysis for cement

1019
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:39,760
production uh and uh uh what do you see

1020
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:44,480
the prospect of director direct H

1021
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:48,079
like uh electrolysis of sea

1022
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,799
Waters so for the cement we have we have

1023
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:54,280
similar analysis for cement uh so it

1024
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:57,599
will be very unfair to tell one

1025
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,280
uh answer but what we've seen is

1026
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,920
currently in most regions carbon capture

1027
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,760
is the most cost effective

1028
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:08,200
decarbonization of option for cement and

1029
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,799
use of hydrogen is like prohibitively

1030
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,040
expensive so that will never be an

1031
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:17,640
option for cement in my opinion but it

1032
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:21,079
might still Depend and for sea salt sea

1033
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:24,000
water Dellin sea water electrolyzers or

1034
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:26,040
use of desalination and use of

1035
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,839
electrolyzers uh that's that's a

1036
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:32,480
feasible option so there are active uh

1037
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:34,480
research and some companies focusing on

1038
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,920
directly using seawater for

1039
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,960
electrolyzers uh but even if you use

1040
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:43,920
decarbonization like reverse osmosis or

1041
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:46,440
so uh actually the energy penalty of

1042
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,559
decarbonization desalination is so low

1043
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,559
relative to hydrogen production it

1044
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,960
doesn't really move the needle in terms

1045
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,960
of economics so and there are many

1046
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,359
regions that are uh not great for Fresh

1047
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,119
Water Resources so for these regions use

1048
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,640
of seaw is definitely a option and the

1049
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:07,480
total cost will not make a huge

1050
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,240
difference okay thanks air uh we still

1051
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,839
have questions but I'm confined by

1052
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,599
schedule I'll let you go Emir thanks

1053
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,599
again
