00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,360
uh hello everyone my name is George vski

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:12,160
I'm former MIT Lin canab researcher and

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,400
now CEO of alata and our mission is

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,920
securing data collaboration and AI

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,800
supply chain so this is how AIML Works

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,480
companies in different industry develop

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,679
applications they deploy them into data

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
analytic

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,000
platforms and at a badrock they use

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,559
clout storage so they want to have data

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,800
daming decision making in real time and

12
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:44,280
respect data privacy and

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:48,239
Trust uh it turns out that in 82% of the

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,600
breaches involved Cloud story data so

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,039
this is vulnerable point of this

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,320
ecosystem and the data security software

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,440
Market is

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,200
skyrocketing uh according to Google

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:09,920
research if attacker has access to

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,720
0.01% of the data set he can completely

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,159
destroy the trained model so garbage in

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,759
garbage

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,799
out the solution is

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,159
alata alata provide the tool kit for

25
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,640
human users devices and

26
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,479
AIML uh analytical

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,119
platforms that enables to provide data

28
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:37,320
privacy and Trust by Design and our

29
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,880
product is fortified data Lake can be

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,600
implemented in hours in

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,759
multioud it provides intuitive user

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,200
experience and it can be seamlessly

33
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,159
integrated with AI platforms like data

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,680
brick

35
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:56,640
snowflake uh IBM Watson AWS maker and

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,520
others so let's look at the example the

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,159
client calls to the customer service and

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,159
all a your call will be transcribed to

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,239
the text and this text will be sent to a

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,400
application as a prompt a application

41
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,080
creates the personalized offer and this

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,200
offer will be provided to the client in

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,000
real

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:23,360
time so this data is very

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,239
sensitive and AI Mo and LM model is also

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,360
very sensitive so it's it's it's trained

47
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:35,120
on real financial transaction and real

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,800
credit history so alata can help here to

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,480
secure audio calls transcriptions

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,239
personalized offers models and also the

51
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,680
data set for

52
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,519
training so existing encryption

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,400
Solutions fall in two

54
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:57,120
categories some provide data privacy by

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Design at cost of integration with AI

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,920
platforms and sums are opposite so

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,040
autostat can do both we provide zero

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,200
trust security and this is applicable

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,959
for a

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,840
IML uh additional autostat even can

61
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,280
boost the cloud the speed of the

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,760
operations because they also compress

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,480
the data for example loading the 1 gab

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,120
of encrypted data using zata can be

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:33,000
three times faster than just using the

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:36,480
same data in in the same cloud and also

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,680
data compression can help to lower the

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,959
cloud storage cost also up to

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,840
60% so we are

70
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:52,959
MIT based team we have US Patent for

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,200
this method and we've done pilots and we

72
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,680
have letter of support by loet Martin

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,720
and British

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Telecom so

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,720
uh we were looking

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,439
for uh strategic partners and if you

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,560
share our vision we would love to

78
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,560
continue this conversation thank you
