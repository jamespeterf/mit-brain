00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,519
Jackson a big theme of my life has been

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,240
focusing on intentional inclusion and

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,080
how I can create environments where

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,640
people can really bring their whole

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,560
authentic selves to work says joy d08 as

greatest climate challenges while

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,440
creating an open and Equitable work

environment where everyone can

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,719
succeed this theme has been cultivated

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,800
throughout her professional and personal

20
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,399
life including as a young Global leader

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,840
at the world economic forum and as a

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,760
board member at out for undergrad an

through her careers both in Aerospace

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,159
and energy D has strived to instill a

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,520
sense of equity and inclusion From the

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,640
Inside

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,439
Out developing a love for

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,280
space dun's childhood was shaped by

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,079
space I was really inspired as a kid to

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,119
be an astronaut she says and for me that

34
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,439
never stopped dun's parents both of whom

35
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,280
had careers in the Aerospace industry

36
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,680
encouraged her from an early age to

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,200
pursue her interests from building model

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,560
rockets to visiting the National Air and

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,799
Space Museum to attending space camp a

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,479
large inspiration for this passion arose

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,040
when she received a signed photo from

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,799
Sally Ride the first American woman in

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,159
space that read to Joy reach for the

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,399
stars as her interest continued to grow

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
in middle school she and her mom looked

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,840
to see what it would take to become an

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,439
astronaut asking questions such as what

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,360
are the common career paths

49
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,880
and what schools did astronauts

50
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,200
typically go to they quickly found that

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
MIT was at the top of that list and by

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
seventh grade Dunn had cter sites on the

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,280
Institute after years of hard work Dunn

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,920
entered MIT in the fall of 2004 with a

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,080
major in Aerospace aeronautical and

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,400
astronautical Engineering Aero Astro at

57
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,519
MIT she remained fully committed to her

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,519
passion while also expanding into other

59
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,440
activities such as Varsity Softball the

60
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,360
MIT undergraduate Association and the

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,440
alpha Kai Omega sority one of the

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,640
highlights of dun's college career was

63
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,560
unified engineering course 16 a

64
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,879
year-long course required for all

65
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,879
aeroastro majors that provides a

66
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,159
foundational knowledge of aerospace

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,120
engineering culminating in a team

68
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,080
competition where students design and

69
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,519
build remote controlled planes to be

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
pitted against each other my team

71
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,959
actually got first place which was very

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,080
exciting and I honestly give a lot of

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,280
that credit to our pilot pilot he did a

74
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,519
very good job of not crashing in fact

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,120
that pilot was Warren hoberg 08 a former

76
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,319
assistant professor in aeroastro and

77
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,440
current NASA Astronaut training for a

78
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,599
mission on the International Space

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,680
Station pursuing her passion at

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,560
SpaceX dun's undergraduate experience

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,319
culminated with an internship at the

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,760
Aerospace manufacturing company SpaceX

83
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,280
in the summer of

84
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,080
2008 it was by far my favorite

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,879
internship of the ones that I had in

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,879
college I got to work on really Hands-On

87
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,400
projects and had the same amount of

88
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,519
responsibility as a full-time employee

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,120
by the end of the internship she was

90
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,640
hired as a propulsion development

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,239
engineer for the dragon spacecraft where

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,000
she helped to build the thrusters for

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,120
the first dragon mission eventually she

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,360
transferred to the role of manufacturing

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,519
engineer a lot of what I've done in my

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
life is building things and looking for

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,959
process improvements so was a natural

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,120
fit from there she Rose through the

99
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,760
ranks eventually becoming the senior

100
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,200
manager of spacecraft manufacturing

101
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,400
engineering where she oversaw all the

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,840
manufacturing test and integration

103
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,519
Engineers working on Dragon it was

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,560
pretty incredible to go from building

105
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,799
thrusters to building the whole vehicle

106
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,560
she says during her tenure Dunn also

107
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,840
co-founded spacex's women's Network and

108
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,520
its LGBT affinity group out and Allied

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,080
it was about providing spaces for

110
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,400
employees to get together and provide a

111
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,800
sense of community she says through

112
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,360
these groups she helped start mentorship

113
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,240
and community outreach programs as well

114
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,600
as helped grow the pipeline of women and

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,000
Leadership roles for the company in

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,759
spite of all her successes at SpaceX she

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,479
couldn't help but think about what came

118
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,199
next I had been at SpaceX for almost a

119
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,360
decade and had these thoughts of do I

120
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,560
want to do another Tour of Duty or look

121
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,680
at doing something else the main

122
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,639
criteria I set for myself was to do

123
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,199
something that is equally or more world

124
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
changing than SpaceX

125
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,560
a pivot to

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,400
Fusion it was at this time in 2018 that

127
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,479
dun received an email from a former

128
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,360
Mentor asking if she had heard about a

129
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,360
Fusion Energy startup called

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,639
Commonwealth Fusion systems CFS that

131
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,960
worked with the MIT plasma science and

132
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,199
fusion Center I didn't know much about

133
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,240
Fusion at all I had heard about it as a

134
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,280
science project that was still many many

135
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,960
years away as a viable energy source

136
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,600
after learning more about the technology

137
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,360
and Company I was just like holy cow

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,000
this has the potential to be even more

139
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,240
world changing than what SpaceX is doing

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,639
she adds I decided that I wanted to

141
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,479
spend my time and brain power focusing

142
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,520
on cleaning up the planet instead of

143
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:49,560
getting off it after connecting with CFS

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:51,520
CEO Bob mum guard sm15 phd5 Jun joined

145
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,880
the company and returned to Cambridge as

146
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,800
the head of manufacturing while moving

147
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,240
from the Aerospace industry to Fusion

148
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,080
Energy was a large shift she said her

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,680
first project building a fusion relevant

150
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,680
high temperature superconducting magnet

151
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,479
capable of achieving 20 Tesla tied back

152
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,800
into her life of being a builder who

153
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,919
likes to get her hands on things over

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,680
the course of 2 years she oversaw the

155
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,160
production and scaling of the magnet

156
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,880
manufacturing process when she first

157
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,720
came in the magnets were being

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,039
constructed in a timec consuming and

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,960
manual way one of the things I'm most

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,240
proud of from this project is teaching

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,919
MIT research scientists how to think

162
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Lake manufacturing Engineers she says it

163
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,160
was a great symbiotic relationship the

164
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,440
MIT folks taught us the physics and

165
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,360
science behind the magnets and we came

166
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,840
in to figure out how to make them into a

167
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,840
more manufacturable product in September

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,080
2021 CFS tested this high temperature

169
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,479
superconducting magnet and achieved its

170
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,120
goal of 20 Tesla this was a pivotal

171
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,240
moment for the company that brought it

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,560
one step closer to achieving its goal of

173
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,919
producing net positive fusion power now

174
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
CFS has begun work on a new campus in

175
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,120
Devon Mass Massachusetts to house their

176
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,080
manufacturing operations and Spark

177
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,599
Fusion device dun plays a pivotal role

178
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,240
in this expansion as well in March 2021

179
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,120
she was promoted to the head of

180
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,120
operations which expanded her

181
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,360
responsibilities Beyond managing

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,400
manufacturing to include facilities

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,400
construction safety and quality it's

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,599
been incredible to watch the campus grow

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,720
from a pile of dirt into full buildings

186
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
in addition to the groundbreaking work

187
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,000
dun highlights the culture of inclusive

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,639
as something that makes CFS stand apart

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,960
to her one of the main reasons that Drew

190
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,400
me to CFS was hearing from the company

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,199
Founders about their thoughts on

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,000

193
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,159
they wanted to make that a key Focus for

194
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,319

195
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:50,199
in my career and I'm really excited to

196
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,800
see how much that's valued at CFS the

197
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,960

206
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
huge lever that we have I'm excited to
