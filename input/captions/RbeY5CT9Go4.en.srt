9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,400
Um, so some of my my perspective on what

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,000
kinds of things you can do with bio

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
action game mechanics and kind of like

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,920
see through that.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,160
Yeah. But it's not it's not the be all

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,800
and end all. Uh, I'm basically sharing

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,360
you my my my perspectives, but it's not

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,480
the only perspective on that. In

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,399
particular, I have very little that I I

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,039
I feel qualified to say about things

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,199
like sports. uh things where you're

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,280
talking about athletic competitions, uh

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,359
you know, faster, higher, uh stronger,

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,520
that that that sort of thing. Um but I

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,359
I'm a little bit more engaged in games

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,119
where there's role playing where you're

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,159
taking on a a persona or at least some

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,439
sort of behavior that you aren't just

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,280
normally doing in real life. Um, it's

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,920
not just about how fast you can run or

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,520
how skilled you are at hitting ball that

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,040
that that sort of thing. Um,

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,680
let's see. And and also not every single

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
liveaction game needs to necessarily fit

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
within role playing or sports. You know,

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,159
you've got things like party games. This

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,759
a this afternoon uh we'll have uh uh the

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,000
lead designer for Dance Central coming

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,280
in to to uh do a little Q&A about D uh

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,200
about Dance Central around 4:00 4:30 in

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
the TV lounge. You guys all welcome to

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,880
do that. And that's arguably a live

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,000
action game. It sure you got a computer.

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,360
You got a one. How How much is the is

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,520
the connect?

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,000
>> $150 something like that.

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,920
>> Something like $150

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,520
piece of equipment connected to a $250

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
Xbox

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
to a screen that's probably even more

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,200
than that.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,120
>> You know, oh, you got all this

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
technology, but in the end, what's that

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,480
game about? You know, what's Rock Band

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
about?

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,440
>> It's about the people who are in the

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,440
living room. you know what and and and

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,920
and what that's one of the arguments

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,080
that Jesper Rio um in a different

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,560
chapter in um in casual re revolution he

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,959
argues that uh one of the big things

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,200
that's happened with gaming is this

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,640
reintroduction of the space in front of

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,920
the screen the the the uh the the living

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,400
room space has has come back into play

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
um you you you you haven't lost that

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,160
with board games or card games but you

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
know for electronic games really. It

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,959
used to be something that existed with

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
arcade games. You know, you got these

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,519
giant um motorcycles or uh steering

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,319
wheels and stuff like that. Um and you

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,800
still kind of had it with some really

72
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
expensive computer games like Flight

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Simulators with people buying like

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,440
joysticks. And I'm I'm a big train fan.

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,400
So, I've got uh I've got a PlayStation

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,319
one train controller. It's a speed and

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,720
it's throttle and brakes. That's all it

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,800
is. That's a steering when it comes to

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,760
trains.

80
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,920
It's a lot of fun. Um

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,200
uh but you know, so with with arcade

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,959
games and of course you have things like

83
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,280
DDR, there's this whole idea that you're

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,799
going to be engaging your entire body.

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
Um

86
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
and and you could argue that those are

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
live action games. And you take the

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
technology out and you and what and what

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,519
you've got this whole idea of this

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
here's this human body and you're

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,040
playing with it and all its constraints.

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,840
It's beholdened to gravity. Uh it's uh

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,480
it can't move faster than a certain than

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,480
a certain speed. It's kind of ungamely

95
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,959
and it's got roughly a certain size. Um

96
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
gives you constraints that you can work

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,280
with in terms of game mechanics. One of

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,200
the things that we did last year was uh

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,239
we had a live we actually had a live

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,000
action game assignment in this class and

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,160
the constraint was you had to be able to

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,880
play the game in this room. Um and I I

103
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,359
was newspaper a constraint uh

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,919
>> no

105
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,400
>> no that was one team's decision to use

106
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,800
uh to use the newspaper as a constraint.

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,320
Um, but they did things like blindfold

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,759
people, you know, they like they were

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,880
playing around with the senses of the

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
body so that you could hear where one

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,919
where one person had unlimited

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,160
ammunition in terms of like little balls

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,240
of newspaper um and and and a bucket um

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
but uh but couldn't see where everybody

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,479
else was. And everybody else could move

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,880
around the room

117
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,800
uh on on sheets of newspaper. They had

118
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,919
to step on sheets of newspaper. So you

119
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,720
could always hear where they were

120
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,000
stepping and you know the the the the

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
person with the bucket was trying to

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
help the people who were starting

123
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,800
around. If you got hit, you had to like

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,040
go out of the out of the the magic

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
circle and then you know start coming

126
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,400
in. The whole idea is to be able to tag

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,919
the person who's actually throwing all

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,759
of these newspaper balls. They had a

129
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,000
little newspaper hat that you could like

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
grab. It was pretty awesome because you

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,600
know what do you need to play that game?

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,800
You need one set of rules, a chair, a

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,680
clean recycle bin, specifically that was

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,000
that big and a newspaper, you know. Uh

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,919
but but there were all these things in

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
flight about what you can do. It's like,

137
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,000
well, okay, your target is going to be

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
roughly the size of a human body and

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,840
roughly the weight of a human body. It's

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,880
going to be able to move at roughly the

141
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,320
same speed of human body and cannot be

142
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,000
you cannot have multiple targets in the

143
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,840
same place at once. In fact, it's

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,400
hilarious when they try because you know

145
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,919
you get these collisions and um uh and

146
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
because they're playing with the human

147
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,400
with all five of human senses usually

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,360
just sight hearing. I don't know

149
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,320
anyone's made a smell game but um the

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,479
you you will have uh you will have a

151
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,479
situation where some where the people

152
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,800
who were standing on the newspapers will

153
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,880
try to make noise near their near the

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,120
other people who are playing the game so

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,360
that uh so they will draw attention away

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
from themselves. Uh, sometimes it works,

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,120
sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it leads

158
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,319
to hilarious uh collisions. A good time

159
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,240
to set up. Um, and those kinds of party

160
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
games, you know, King of the Hill, uh,

161
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
you know, uh,

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,199
um, any other Can anyone think of any

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,520
like playground type games that that are

164
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,520
personal favorites?

165
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,840
>> Lava. What's a what's you have like

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,360
playground like you know swings and all

167
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
all the things you can climb on and like

168
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,039
you you're playing generally on like a

169
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,720
rock like the little pedal like rocky

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,080
stuff and like you step on the pedal

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
stuff that's like the lava and you get

172
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,240
burnt. Um and so like you have to stay

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,680
hanging on like all the metal parts and

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,759
then usually there's someone who's like

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
immune to the lava trying to tag you so

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,960
that like they can walk all over the

177
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,800
lava but they can't go on the structure.

178
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,360
>> So lava monster

179
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
ever stopped just out of curiosity.

180
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,039
Well, someone comes the next lava

181
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,880
monster.

182
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,160
>> Yeah. Once you take then you switch

183
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,080
roles, keep going.

184
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,599
>> But the thing is like I never played

185
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,880
that in like playground. I always played

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
in like my living room. They're like

187
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
couch cushions and stuff. All I ever

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,759
did.

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
>> Cool.

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,560
>> That sounds really dangerous.

191
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,880
>> I used

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,960
wheelie chairs and push off thing. Yeah.

193
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,639
>> I used to have the bunk bed. So So there

194
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
was like some verticality that I could

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,120
have in my in my bedroom bedroom and

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
with my uh with my two brothers and but

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
they were both bigger than me. So I was

198
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,360
lost.

199
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,280
about that would be awesome.

200
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,599
>> I mean you can sort of think of you know

201
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,479
that on one hand these are athletic

202
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,800
games because they they do test your

203
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,000
ability to move and the control that you

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,440
have in your body which is why it's so

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,759
popular among kids who are sort of

206
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,599
trying to master what their bodies are

207
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,520
capable of. Um, but on the other hand,

208
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,840
um, they're also sort of games of

209
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,520
mimicry, going back to Kalawa, uh,

210
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,199
definition, because they're sort of

211
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,639
pretending that there's lava and they're

212
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
sort of pretending that you're a person

213
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,440
who cares that there's lava. Uh, you

214
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,919
know, or a monster that's immune to it.

215
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,919
Um, and

216
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,440
these games don't necessarily, and there

217
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,000
may be some rules about, okay, you've

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,520
been tagged, now we swap. Um, I've seen

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,840
games where sure I've technically been

220
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,319
tagged out of this game, but since this

221
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
game really has no end state, that just

222
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,080
means that, oh, I lost now. I'm back in

223
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
the game again. Um, it's like it's like

224
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,839
playing a Doom Death match, you know,

225
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,479
and you die and you just you're just

226
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,519
right back in the game again, right? Um,

227
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,039
>> let's see. and want to play those um I

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
think it's like I can't remember what's

229
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,320
the name of the football variant where

230
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
you just have like a scarf attached to

231
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,640
your

232
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,040
>> Oh flag football flag football yeah and

233
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,720
um for those people who everyone knows

234
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,200
what it is yeah anyone doesn't

235
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,200
>> I mean like

236
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,720
you just have a flag and instead of

237
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,480
>> being

238
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,120
instead of tackling you just grab the

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,560
flag and that's that's an abstraction

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
All right. And that's an abstraction of

241
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
something that you well could physically

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,519
do. You could grab this person and pull

243
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,920
him to the ground.

244
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,920
>> This touch football.

245
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,440
>> That's another

246
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
smaller level of abstraction because you

247
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,000
can really hit someone pretty damn hard

248
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,920
with touch with touch football. Um, but

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
it's an abstraction of here's this thing

250
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
that I personally physically could do,

251
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
but I'm going to introduce a level of

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,160
abstraction for I don't know safety. Uh,

253
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,399
that's usually the reason. Um, and so

254
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,480
you've got the human body and you've got

255
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,320
all of its all of its values and virtues

256
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,839
and all of its curses. You know, you've

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,360
got issues of safety. You've got uh uh

258
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,839
you know, you you don't want people to

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,600
hurt each other and you can and but yet

260
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,320
human beings and their bodies are

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,720
extremely capable of hurting each other

262
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,399
with no added implements at all. Even

263
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,000
worse when it gets to a game and there

264
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,480
and someone's trying to win something,

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,399
you know, and and you know, if you don't

266
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,240
have an explicit rule that says you

267
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,560
can't punch this person, but you have a

268
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,880
game that that's very athletic,

269
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
someone's going to try. Um, that's why

270
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,360
you get these sort of abstractions or uh

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,839
and you can't to pretend in that

272
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,680
military form like all right, I grabbed

273
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,680
this thing off you now, you have just

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,200
been attacked uh and now I've

275
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,600
effectively tackled you. You can't move

276
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,839
anymore. Um,

277
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:40,240
so what I'm trying to draw attention to

278
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,959
with these examples is that um, with

279
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,920
live action games, the thing that you

280
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,399
have to keep in mind all the time is at

281
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,880
what point is the person who's playing

282
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,640
actually the character who's playing?

283
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
It's really, really hard to tell when it

284
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,480
comes to live action games. If you're

285
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:04,000
playing in um in sports, it's the same

286
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,240
it's it's the same thing, you know. Um

287
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,800
name any given athlete, you know, and

288
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,360
and and their performance in the sport

289
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,120
is who they are. It's the same person.

290
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
If I'm role playing, then the person

291
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,519
that I'm playing is not supposed to be

292
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,880
the same. But there need to be a whole

293
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,519
bunch of rules that basically specify

294
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,440
that the character that I'm playing is

295
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
not actually the charact the person that

296
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,760
you're seeing in front of you. Um, you

297
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,440
know, Philip Than the player is not the

298
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519
count of Monte Crystal or something like

299
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,240
that. One interesting exception to that

300
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,399
is like uh like wrestling like like like

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,839
the not like wrestling like actual like

302
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,040
high school wrestling but like wrestling

303
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,519
that's on TV like I don't remember what

304
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,920
it's called.

305
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
>> Oh yeah

306
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
>> cuz everybody puts on a persona like

307
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,600
they're never the same person that they

308
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
are. I just thought it was interesting

309
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,680
when you said that any sports person but

310
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,480
like that's one exception

311
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,240
>> that's true and well it's and and that

312
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
leads a lot that creates a lot of

313
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,279
discussion about whether is wrestling is

314
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,079
a spot a sport. It's athletic. Everyone

315
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,360
agrees that it's athletic basis artists

316
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,120
are athletic but you wouldn't call

317
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,360
consider that sport right. So um in fact

318
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,320
if I understand correctly wrestlers are

319
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,760
insured as circus performers uh because

320
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,680
they have the same risks and they're

321
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,079
sort of playing the same role as a

322
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,600
performance. Um but you're right that

323
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,680
that's that's that's one of those things

324
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,839
where it's a persona. Um

325
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,000
the really really good wrestling

326
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,120
networks play around with what's real

327
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,040
and what's not, you know. Yeah, sure.

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,800
This these two people are putting on

329
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,120
these ridiculous uh personalities,

330
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,760
you know, threatening to kill each other

331
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,720
over the most trivial and made up of of

332
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,399
circumstances um and uh and crazy

333
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
accents and costumes and everything. But

334
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,519
when they're bleeding, they're actually

335
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,600
bleeding.

336
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,120
that there's no denying on that and no

337
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
doubt occasionally they actually get

338
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,000
angry at each other and you know people

339
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,079
actually get get hurt and playing around

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,160
with that line is actually some of the

341
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,760
appeal that you get in in things like

342
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
professional professional wrestling I

343
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,120
guess that's what's the term the

344
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,880
terminology

345
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,920
um that we use very different from

346
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,680
something like mixed martial arts right

347
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,079
you know there's no

348
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,360
>> it's I don't watch mixed martial arts

349
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,200
>> I don't think so I'm pretty sure it's

350
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,880
just

351
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,440
But they are very associated with the

352
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,079
person.

353
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
>> Yeah.

354
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,320
>> So they are the person stage

355
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,440
personalities but they do have strong

356
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,440
personalities.

357
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
>> That's definitely a sport. I mean

358
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
they're actually fighting.

359
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,200
>> Yeah. I mean I mean that's I mean if you

360
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,399
take if you look at Muhammad Ali for

361
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,160
instance you know half you're extremely

362
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,639
athletic person but the personality had

363
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
a lot to do with it with how successful

364
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,760
that he was. you know, the way that he

365
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,920
taunt people uh you know, on TV and on

366
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,600
cameras before the game so that people

367
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,000
would get all worked up for the game

368
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,560
made him a star. Sure, he was athletic,

369
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,920
but you know, that's most part of it. Um

370
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,720
so where that line is and as designers,

371
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,399
you get to you get some control over

372
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
that through the rules that you that

373
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,839
that you're writing. Um, and there are a

374
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,279
couple of tactics that that that uh that

375
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:19,279
you can focus on, but um I want to segue

376
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,880
into that. That's attention. That is one

377
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,680
thing that's pulling your design in one

378
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,560
direction, which is how am I going to

379
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
figure out what the difference between

380
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,000
the person who's playing this game and

381
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,600
the character that they're playing or

382
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,959
the role that they're playing is going

383
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,639
to be. um you know in your games for

384
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,240
this next assignment. You know you if

385
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,160
you got people playing mental patience

386
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,839
then you've got to figure out how you're

387
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,440
going to draw that line. You don't you

388
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,440
don't you want to be kind of clear

389
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,440
whether it's the player who's actually

390
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,560
upset at you or the characters who's

391
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,800
actually upset at you. Um, but if you

392
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,240
draw that line too broadly, then you got

393
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,920
this situation where I'm supposed to be

394
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,839
angry at you, but I'm laughing all the

395
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,720
time because this is a ridiculous

396
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,639
situation and emotional pretending to be

397
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,240
really emotional can possibly can

398
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,639
usually

399
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,199
make a lot of people react by laughing

400
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,320
just to release the tension in space.

401
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,360
Um, in fact, that happened when uh Dion

402
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,120
was were playing with Cesar, right? I

403
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
mean, sure, they they were laughing.

404
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
They were trying their level best to

405
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,800
take it as seriously as possible. And

406
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,560
everybody else in the room was trying to

407
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,079
um to relieve that tension and sometimes

408
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,600
that's okay for your game. In fact,

409
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,079
sometimes that's great for your game and

410
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,000
sometimes that's detrimental. Depends on

411
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,160
what you're going for. Um but you have

412
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,920
to understand that that that is

413
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,399
something that's pulling all your

414
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,399
design, why your rule exists, why your

415
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,079
game mechanic exists, and why your game

416
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,199
mechanic is written in a certain way.

417
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,839
That's one of the tensions that's

418
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,440
pulling it in the in a certain

419
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
direction.

420
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,199
In reality, that's actually two

421
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,880
different tensions because on one sense,

422
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,920
you're trying to make an experience as

423
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,399
as immersive, as you know, feeling like

424
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,680
you're actually doing it as possible.

425
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,800
And on the other hand, you don't want to

426
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,720
make it so associated with who you are

427
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,399
and what you're actually doing that

428
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
people start to think, "Oh, wow. This

429
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,880
person, this this player is actually mad

430
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,800
at me, you know, or this player could

431
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,320
actually hit me at this point." Uh, you

432
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,440
know, whereas they say, "No, the

433
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
character could hit me, but the player

434
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,720
is not going to hit me, you know." Um,

435
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,079
so I call that um uh very simplitude. Uh

436
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,480
these are just words that I that I

437
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,839
picked up from dictionary to to describe

438
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,880
these things. This will be during my

439
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,560
master's thesis. Um,

440
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,800
jurisditude is basically the um when

441
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,040
you're trying to it's it's it's a

442
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,279
tension when you're designing a game

443
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,440
mechanic. And that tension is telling

444
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,040
you I want to make this experience as

445
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
immersive and as true to life as

446
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,920
possible. Um, and the opposite of that

447
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,040
is uh what I call dissociation. Um,

448
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,600
which is really hard to pronounce. So

449
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,839
sometimes I just call it separation. Um,

450
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,240
but how do you draw that line between

451
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
who I am and who my character is? Uh,

452
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
and I I'll give you a couple of

453
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,280
examples. Uh, just just just to get

454
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,760
these ideas down. Um,

455
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,640
in in a live action role playing game,

456
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,079
uh, actually, who doesn't know what a

457
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
live action role playing game is or

458
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
doesn't have a good a clear idea

459
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,679
>> how they work?

460
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
>> Okay. Um, okay. Okay. So, so some so

461
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,160
some so maybe a little bit of background

462
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,000
on how on ju just so that I I can use

463
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,679
the examples. Um do you know do do you

464
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
know do you folks know how a tabletop

465
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,720
role playing game generally works? You

466
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,440
know like a D and D game.

467
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,400
>> Not really. No.

468
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,480
>> Okay. All right. So start from scratch.

469
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,679
Imagine improv theater. Imagine you have

470
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,480
a environment where you have a bunch of

471
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,000
people who want to enact some sort of

472
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,440
scene together. This scene in on

473
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,520
theater, the scene is usually something

474
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,520
like five minutes, maybe half an hour.

475
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,360
Uh in a live action role playing game,

476
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,799
that's more likely an hour to 10 days to

477
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,440
30 days long. Uh a much longer uh period

478
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,520
of of time, but the but the motivation

479
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,480
is the same. We're in this space to

480
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,919
enact some sort of shared reality,

481
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,559
shared created reality to together. Now,

482
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,880
in a role playing game, that's done by,

483
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,760
you know, the usual additional rules,

484
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,679
uh, uh, and usually some sort of world

485
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,679
setting and some sort of character

486
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,480
description. And how these things are

487
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,559
told to you could be as simple as the

488
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,840
game master walks up to each person and

489
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,360
explains what's going on. You know, you

490
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:47,760
are all cats in an alleyway, you know,

491
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,520
and that and some of you are, you know,

492
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
are hungry and looking for food. you're

493
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,039
on top of the packing order and you kind

494
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,880
of make sure that you get all the food.

495
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,360
Here's how here's how you eat food.

496
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Here's how you move food around. Go, you

497
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,799
know, that sort of thing. A GM, a game

498
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,240
master could could just do it at that

499
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,360
level. And you've got a live action role

500
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
playing game. There's usually some sort

501
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
of win condition or at least some sort

502
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
of time limit to tell you when the

503
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,280
game's over.

504
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,120
Um, when you get a little bit more

505
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,480
detail and when you start mixing and

506
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,840
matching it with thing with the

507
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,919
conventions of other kinds of role

508
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,760
playing games, computer and tabletop

509
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,559
role playing games, you have things like

510
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,559
character sheets where you're given your

511
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,000
information on a piece of paper or you

512
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,280
create your information in a piece of

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,280
paper. Um, and that information's

514
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,440
information is only available to you and

515
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,320
the game master. Um, the secret

516
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,919
information for intents and purposes.

517
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Um,

518
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,480
and uh, and you will use different means

519
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,000
to convey chunks of the information to

520
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,520
the rest of the world. Like um, I'm

521
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,520
actually not female, but I'm playing a

522
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,679
female character, so maybe I'll wear a

523
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,080
badge or something that has my gender on

524
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,960
it, and that tells the rest of the

525
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,640
world, treat me like a female. Uh,

526
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,919
that's that's that's one example. Um, I

527
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,600
may actually be psychic, but the rest of

528
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,360
the world can't necessarily see that

529
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,799
except for maybe other psychic people.

530
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,840
So, maybe I'll have a little Greek

531
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,000
symbol or something. Um, not not sigh.

532
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,000
That would be too obvious.

533
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Omega

534
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
um or or you know or maybe my badge is

535
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,520
just a different color or something. And

536
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,960
people who are not psychic have no idea

537
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,240
what it means. And people who are

538
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,559
playing other psychic characters now

539
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,080
say, "Oh, that person has a red badge.

540
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,880
you know, I am sensing psychic ways.

541
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,240
Um, and maybe then now there are game

542
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
mechanics that I can do with that

543
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
person. It's like actually all the

544
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,000
psychic people know each other's cell

545
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,159
phone numbers or something. We can talk

546
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
to each other. Uh, that's that's an

547
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,799
example. Um,

548
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,799
>> that's awesome.

549
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,280
>> That would be an easy way to to manage

550
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:56,080
it. Um

551
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,960
uh then um so so the connection with

552
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,039
improv theater is actually

553
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,559
stronger than a lot of people may

554
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,360
generally assume because a lot of people

555
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,799
think of it think of live action role

556
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,640
playing games and they focus on the

557
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,960
games part of it you know and they and

558
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,720
they think of it as an RPG uh in the

559
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,880
computer sense so you ro your character

560
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
um in the sense of I have my character

561
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,799
stats my character's abilities

562
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,080
A lot of these stats and abilities don't

563
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
necessarily need to be stuff that's

564
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,799
written down because again you're

565
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,080
dealing with a human body. So um how

566
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,280
strong is your character? I don't know

567
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,120
how strong are you? You know um how long

568
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,360
you know how long a sword do I have?

569
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,400
Well how long is that piece of foam over

570
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,120
there? Like that's your sword now.

571
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
>> You got to when I left the assassin

572
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,320
skill I played a character that's

573
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,840
supposed to be very very strong. I'm not

574
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,520
very very strong, but I had like as you

575
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,039
describe a little badge, the way that it

576
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,240
manifested itself in gameplay was that

577
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,679
at some point I challenged someone to an

578
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,000
arm wrestling duel

579
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,919
>> and they made sure to like looked at my

580
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,280
stat and saw, oh, I know what this

581
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,960
means. And so even though they were

582
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,640
about twice my size, they pretended to

583
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,120
lose.

584
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,760
>> Yeah, it was it was very entertaining.

585
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,520
So, so that that's the spectrum of, you

586
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,760
know, on one hand there are these games

587
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,840
where uh well the the kinds of games

588
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,320
that Jeremy

589
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,240
describes allows you to play things that

590
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,919
are physically very different from you

591
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,039
and then there are games there are some

592
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,240
live action role playing games

593
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,400
>> it's just how strong you are.

594
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,760
>> Yeah, it's just how strong you are. Um a

595
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,480
lot of those are like buffer LARs. Um

596
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,919
people uh will dress up in actual armor

597
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,480
that they've decided to make out of

598
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,080
leather or duct tape. Uh and you know

599
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
they will swing around swords that are

600
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,000
foam padded. They'll go out to a forest

601
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,960
somewhere in typically New England and

602
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,480
you know spend two two days three days

603
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,559
in the middle of forest you know

604
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,039
sleeping in in a cabin somewhere and

605
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,559
pretending to do fantasy adventuring.

606
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,640
And every once in a while there will be

607
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,679
GM control volunteers who will be

608
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,520
wearing like monster masks and people

609
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,120
you know that's that's that's one for

610
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,480
that that's that's that's on the other

611
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,400
spectrum but it's all this it's a

612
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,520
spectrum you know it's not like you know

613
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,200
there's there's these life um there are

614
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,000
bottle arps where you run around with

615
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,000
sticks and there are

616
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,760
um assassin guild type arps where your

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,240
and where most of your abilities are

618
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,080
governed by numbers and stats. Yeah,

619
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,559
kind of this spectrum. You can think of

620
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,960
the assassin guilt type things as being

621
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,640
very much inspired by what you could do

622
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
on a computer, what you could do on

623
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,720
tabletop LAR because on tabletop LAR,

624
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
how strong the character is has nothing

625
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,400
to do with how strong the player is,

626
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,120
right? It's what's that you

627
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,760
just recently found out that in New

628
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,320
England there are basically lots which

629
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,840
get done with air rifles.

630
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,440
>> Mhm. So

631
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,480
>> military

632
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,240
paintball people,

633
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,640
>> but they're not they're not paintball.

634
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,720
So institute people with plastic

635
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,400
pellets.

636
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,559
>> And yeah, airsoft is what they're

637
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,200
called. And then and so like one team

638
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,000
will dress up as US soldiers and the

639
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,799
other one's like Middle East insurgents

640
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,240
or something in town. Yeah. Yeah. It's

641
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,559
it's elaborate but it's slightly

642
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,760
distasteful.

643
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,840
>> And you can go and look at their

644
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
website. I think it's the New England

645
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,520
Airsoft Association or something like

646
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,919
that and they have like little excerpts

647
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,360
that have been video cam of these

648
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,080
>> but but the people who are

649
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,760
>> when there's like negotiation between

650
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,360
between the two sides and what have you.

651
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,480
They actually could tend to take on the

652
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,000
roles of the insurgents or the people

653
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
sometimes. So yeah, sometimes they're

654
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,120
just shooting each other. Other times

655
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,799
they're like trying to find out who in

656
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,080
the town is the person who's the bad

657
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,520
guy.

658
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,880
Sometimes it gets more elaborate and

659
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,840
it's like, you know, we're all going to

660
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
some of us are actually going to be

661
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,120
civilians and some of us are actually

662
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,480
going to be combatants and the other to

663
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,240
figure out who's who.

664
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,440
>> Um,

665
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,840
that one will be really really

666
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,080
interesting to have rules for IEDs. Uh,

667
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,559
because I think that will that will

668
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,720
that's something that I that I that that

669
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,640
annoys me about games that involve

670
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,880
Middle Eastern combatants

671
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,360
>> is that they don't have rules for IEDs.

672
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,400
And it's like that's the primary form of

673
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,960
combat in that space. Anyway,

674
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,039
um but yeah, but but actually that

675
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,080
that's a good point. Military military

676
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,520
exercises are actually a lot of them are

677
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,840
basically live action role playing

678
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
games. They all the way from I'm

679
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,840
actually running around with a gun full

680
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
of blanks or shooting pellets or

681
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,120
shooting a laser beam that is going to

682
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,080
register on some other soldiers gear uh

683
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,039
as as being hit.

684
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,159
>> We call them war games.

685
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,640
>> We call them war games.

686
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,320
>> Yeah. And

687
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,520
Yes, that that's really um um but you

688
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,799
also have the other end of military

689
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,000
simulations where it's just a bunch of

690
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,320
people in a room on looking at a screen

691
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,720
uh or you not not even a screen a

692
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,760
whiteboard uh with a world map on it and

693
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,320
they're moving forces around you know

694
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,480
like a tabletop LA but those are still

695
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,360
considered sort of live action things

696
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,720
because every person in the room is

697
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,400
representing someone in the chain of

698
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,559
command that would normally be in a war

699
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,159
room at a like um you know I'm the

700
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,679
commander,

701
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,640
you're the lieutenant or something like

702
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,760
that and I'm going to say give me the

703
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,520
status of you know Washington DC has it

704
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
been used yet that sort of thing and you

705
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,520
know lieutenant says you know we have

706
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,159
three three three missiles coming in or

707
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,640
something based on some lookup um the

708
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,400
term for that is typically called creek

709
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,440
spiel especially when it's um when it's

710
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,080
real people playing against real people

711
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,159
uh like this is two or more player uh

712
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,400
game uh where not everyone's on the same

713
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,200
side. If it's on if it's just on one

714
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,400
side, then just the war game terminology

715
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,799
tends to be more a catchall. Um but when

716
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,480
you have two players on each side and

717
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,520
they're playing through these things,

718
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:02,799
how results get resolved uh uh also uh

719
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,360
can vary. There are obviously digital

720
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,760
and mathematical ways to compute. Okay,

721
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,480
I fired I have given an order to fire a

722
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,600
missile at

723
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,159
Singapore and and

724
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,080
you know and it's going to take you know

725
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,440
two hours for it to land and there's a

726
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,200
percentage that it might land and things

727
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,520
like that. you you you could do it you

728
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,840
could do it that way but traditionally

729
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,080
what's actually been done is that you

730
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,240
say this is what I'm going to do and

731
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,159
someone far more experienced than you

732
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,080
usually your instructor or one of

733
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,279
several instructors takes that

734
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,240
information and goes into another room

735
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,840
and talks to the people who are actually

736
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,840
doing the same thing with your opposing

737
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,159
team and they're just saying okay in

738
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,720
this in this event what's going to

739
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,120
happen and then they go back to each

740
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,080
team and they report, you know, your

741
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,960
missile missed or, you know, your troops

742
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,080
engag you found your opponent's troops

743
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,679
in this location and you lost 50% of

744
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
your troops. This sort of thing. And

745
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,960
that's kind of the traditional pre-

746
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,559
creature game. The nice thing about that

747
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
that takes advantage of the fact that

748
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,120
not just the players, but everybody is

749
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,799
live action human being because you have

750
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,600
flexibility. You know, you can do

751
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,919
ridiculous things like, you know, uh

752
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,320
that that programmers or game designers

753
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,360
may not necessarily have assumed were

754
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,600
possible, but happen to make sense in

755
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,760
the heat in the heat of that particular

756
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,600
game. Uh and you have real people

757
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,279
deciding this is what's going to happen.

758
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,960
So, we'll we'll make up a logical uh uh

759
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,000
solution. In military, that's why you

760
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,440
want people who are really really

761
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,880
experienced. um in a non-military live

762
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,039
action role playing game by the kind

763
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,919
that has played around in MIT. People

764
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,640
will still still do that, you know. I So

765
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:53,120
I'm in a game where

766
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:56,159
I know it's a steampunk setting and I

767
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,919
don't have all the equipment I need to

768
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,960
build this machine of death that I'm

769
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,880
trying that I'm supposed to be

770
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,799
completing, but I could take apart some

771
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,399
of the other machines that are in the

772
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,600
world. And then the game master says,

773
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,440
"Wait a minute. If you're going to put

774
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,279
rules about that or we never thought

775
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,880
about anyone taking a part of the abuse

776
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,840
quick, but it makes perfect sense in

777
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,440
this world. So, okay, it's going to take

778
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,120
you two hours and you have to be in this

779
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,600
room, but after that, you all the parts

780
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,360
you need, you know, and and that's one

781
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,640
of the the other side of live action

782
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,919
role playing is that often the people

783
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,640
who are controlling the game are also

784
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,640
live action. They're also there uh and

785
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,640
and and they can they can improvise

786
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,039
along with the players.

787
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,720
Um, so you have that bit of flexibility.

788
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,159
You're limited by how experienced those

789
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,120
people are. Um, people who don't tend to

790
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,360
be terribly experienced tend to make

791
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,600
rash decisions

792
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,520
uh that end up hurting the playability

793
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,559
of game. Sometimes they get lucky,

794
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:59,039
sometimes they don't. Uh uh let me see

795
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,440
one example

796
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,679
in early on when I was making live

797
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:09,840
action role playing games was I had a

798
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,919
game mechanic where if anybody um if if

799
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,080
one of the police officers you know in

800
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,880
in this sort of detective scenario

801
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,919
wanted to do a background check um they

802
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,760
could they could ask the game master and

803
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,520
some amount of time actually you'll

804
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,600
spend instant because a fairly modern

805
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,120
kind of uh system and the assumption was

806
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,799
that they find a computer and they will

807
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,320
look it up and I will give them

808
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,159
information

809
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,679
and that led to two problems was that

810
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,440
first of all what happens if I'm not

811
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,520
have physically in the same location as

812
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,039
a person who has the information and

813
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,880
it's just weird to think of a computer

814
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,840
with legs walking around all stuff it's

815
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,960
not a science fiction game um and on the

816
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,679
other hand it means that I needed to

817
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,320
have all the information about everybody

818
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,279
at my fingertips at all times

819
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,039
uh which often was not true. So someone

820
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,960
will come here, I need the information

821
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,760
about this character, you know, I'm

822
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,720
performing a lookup and it's like I'll

823
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,640
get back to you in two hours because I

824
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,240
do not have that information with me.

825
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,320
I'm going to look it up and I'll give it

826
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,679
to you later. Now I don't make that

827
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,360
mistake anymore but that was the kind of

828
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,320
mistake that I used to make when I was a

829
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,559
when I was a VGM because I hadn't really

830
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,520
thought about about what that will

831
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,640
require from me as investor. Now that's

832
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,520
a different tension. Um I am actually

833
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,360
going to take a chunk of this to sort of

834
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,640
figure out the tensions while I'm

835
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,640
discussing them. I talked about very

836
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,640
simplitude.

837
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,200
I talked about dissociation

838
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,120
or separation

839
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,240
and and what I'm talking about with that

840
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,519
mistake that I made is just plain old

841
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,440
feasibility. um some something that you

842
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,960
probably have already run into with the

843
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,960
games that you've designed,

844
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,960
>> but

845
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,760
you know, in many of the games that you

846
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,600
designed, feasibility could be thought

847
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,720
of as just playing on scope. You know,

848
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,799
it's like how big is this game? Uh how

849
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,039
long is it going to take us to put all

850
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,679
these bits together?

851
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,679
I'm looking at you.

852
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,919
um you know can we order these bits in

853
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
time and are they going to be delivered

854
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,159
in time for the class? I know multiple

855
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,559
teams had this problem. Yeah.

856
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,600
>> Yeah. Uh

857
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,200
one thing that the uh Okay, so here's

858
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,200
let me see whether I can combine some of

859
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,159
these ideas together. Um, one thing that

860
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,640
the uh that the assassin guild likes to

861
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,279
have are people who kind of have locked

862
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,600
memories. You know, they know something,

863
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,559
but they don't know that they know it.

864
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,000
>> Memory packets.

865
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,679
>> Yes. Little memory packets. Little

866
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,440
pieces of paper that they print it out

867
00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,799
and fold it up and staple. You know,

868
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,159
takes you about 20 seconds to make one

869
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:08,240
of those. Um, now imagine a game that

870
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,480
has maybe 60 people and about and each

871
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,960
person maybe has five locked memories

872
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,600
because the GMs really love this idea.

873
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,720
And how long is that? 5* 60 300

874
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,279
>> that's only about an hour.

875
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
>> Huh?

876
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,760
>> Only about an hour.

877
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,600
>> It's only about an hour. Does it ever

878
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,679
actually only take an hour to actually

879
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,880
produce that? You You get like staple

880
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,600
codes and paper

881
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,799
towels. It's like 2 hours. Oh yeah.

882
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,840
>> Okay. It's it's a little less than 2

883
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,039
hours actually.

884
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,919
>> Yeah. But

885
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,159
>> by the end of it

886
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,159
>> 20 seconds

887
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,559
>> 20 times.

888
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,320
>> And then and then what happens is that

889
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,000
oh wow we have 300 pieces of paper all

890
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,679
of which are now folded and almost

891
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,880
indistinguishable from each other. And

892
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,880
we've got to figure out who gets which.

893
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,279
>> And this and these are the the the

894
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,120
concerns. You know it's like when when

895
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,919
you know that that's a feasibility

896
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,600
issue. It's like um doing something for

897
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,080
doing something like that for one or two

898
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,159
players is extremely feasible. Takes

899
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,720
almost no time from the game master's

900
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,960
point of view. Um doing like that for

901
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,679
your entire player base if you have a 60

902
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,839
person game and on a large scale you

903
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,760
know becomes the majority of your of

904
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,359
your prep time. You know s c suddenly

905
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,000
you're setting aside a whole day just to

906
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,839
deal with that and your game's only like

907
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,599
three days long or or something like

908
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,599
that. You know exactly that that level

909
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:35,839
of effort. um things to preserve the

910
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:40,159
game master's sanity, you know. Um

911
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:43,280
the MIT uh janitorial staff, the

912
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,119
facility staff are pretty ruthless when

913
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,839
it comes to picking up stuff that has

914
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,520
fallen on the floor. So, say that's a

915
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,119
really important piece of paper that

916
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,480
you've taped up on the wall somewhere

917
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,079
here in MIT. Uh and uh you know, this

918
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,760
information and this is the place that

919
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,599
your players are looking for. They've

920
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,320
combed all of campus and they need to

921
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,640
find this location. And that tape that

922
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,200
you used just wasn't that strong. It

923
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,200
fell on the piece of giant stuff just

924
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,200
vacuums it up, throws it away. Now, what

925
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,640
happens to your game? You know, can your

926
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,760
game even end? You know, um are you

927
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,839
going to just have a whole bunch of

928
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,920
really tired pissed players on your uh

929
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:25,200
you know, chasing you down as a game

930
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,599
master? Um so that the way how you

931
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,599
resolve this can be built into your game

932
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,520
mechanics. You can build things like

933
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,240
multiple redundancy. You know it's like

934
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,280
in addition to a sign that will usually

935
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,119
be this other thing in that same area.

936
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,800
If you find one and don't find the

937
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,040
other, it means something has dropped

938
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,400
off. You know, inform the game master

939
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,359
and the game master will go and fix it

940
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,520
at some point in time in the future. Um,

941
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,680
you could give people, if you have a

942
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,280
game that has no secret locations and

943
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,280
you're making it, I don't know, campus

944
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,599
wide, you could just give people a map

945
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,119
of all the information. Sure, you still

946
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,960
want stuff on the wall because, you

947
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,040
know, it's kind of neat to be able to

948
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,079
walk into a classroom like this and say,

949
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,000
"Oh, mortuary, that's where I am." And

950
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,200
then you're suddenly reminded, okay,

951
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,960
maybe I should be role playing for the

952
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,400
fact that I'm more, you know, that sort

953
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,440
of thing. Um but uh you know instead of

954
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,880
like walking through a space and you had

955
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,079
a map that told you that you were in

956
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,280
mortuary but you weren't looking in your

957
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,440
map so you just walked through the space

958
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,240
and you entreated it like classroom like

959
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,160
yes I am going to do my tooling in this

960
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,400
room. It's a bor what you doing.

961
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,400
Um, so it's really neat to be able to

962
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
have those things to give players

963
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,359
information about what's going on in the

964
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,960
space and to help them make believe,

965
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,320
help them imagine what they could

966
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,760
possibly do in the space, maybe even

967
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,119
give them clues about what they need to

968
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,480
be doing in order to advance their

969
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,560
goals. But, uh, but then you also want

970
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
to be able to have backup plans for when

971
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,000
those things fail. Uh, that's that's

972
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,839
part of feasibility. you know, you don't

973
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,320
want your game to break halfway just

974
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,880
because janitorial stack came to or the

975
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,079
glue, you know, the wind blew or

976
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,680
something and now you your your your

977
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,000
um

978
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,000
so that's that's another information

979
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,560
and that's not entirely unlike the

980
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,480
information that we've discussed in this

981
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:24,960
class uh back earlier this semester. Um

982
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,800
but uh with live action games,

983
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,800
especially live action games that don't

984
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,560
have any kind of turnbased thing,

985
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,960
they're happening in real time. You're

986
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,079
you're moving in real time. Um

987
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,520
information overload on the player

988
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,960
becomes something that you have to be

989
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,040
very careful when you're designing a

990
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,720
game mechanic. How much is someone is

991
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,119
someone expected to know at any given

992
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,359
time? Um, this is going to be very

993
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,599
applicable for any of the games that you

994
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,520
design for the third assignment bin. Um,

995
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,680
if you decide to do a live action game,

996
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,200
you think about here's somebody who's

997
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,560
moving around in a space. Maybe it's a

998
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,200
hospital or maybe it's a doctor's

999
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:03,359
office. Um,

1000
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,079
and this person is trying to remember

1001
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,079
ex uh some number of stat of statistics,

1002
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,160
you know, about their character, how

1003
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,200
agitated I am, how um what's what's my

1004
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,880
current uh the the a number that

1005
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,119
determines how many drugs I've got in me

1006
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,640
right now, you know, that that sort of

1007
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,520
thing. um that you've got these stats

1008
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,040
and once you get too high then what

1009
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,280
happens is that you've got a character

1010
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,680
standing there trying to do all the math

1011
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,800
in their head and not role playing. If

1012
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,200
they're role playing anything they're

1013
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,720
roleplaying like a mathematician or or a

1014
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,079
deer in their legs. They you know you're

1015
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,320
losing their immersion. You're losing

1016
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,560
the diverse meat of the I'm supposed to

1017
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,320
be an angry person but I'm instead I'm

1018
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,359
standing here trying to do math about

1019
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,200
how angry I am. um and you've got the

1020
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,000
attention of information and person.

1021
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,720
Um there are times where you actually

1022
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,560
kind of want that though. Uh this there

1023
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,920
are ways to take that to uh turn that

1024
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,520
into to your advantage. Um

1025
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,760
uh this the in particular when the thing

1026
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,359
that you want people to be doing the

1027
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,680
kind of activity you want them to be to

1028
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,440
engage to engage in are the things that

1029
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
players will generally be uncomfortable

1030
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,119
doing with each other. Physical violence

1031
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,240
would be a good example of that. You

1032
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,320
know, I want to be able to hurt this

1033
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,640
other character, but I don't want to

1034
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,760
hurt this other player. So, what are the

1035
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,160
things that I can do to to bridge that

1036
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,400
gap?

1037
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,560
>> Insult is another

1038
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,720
>> verbally. Sure. there there are ways to

1039
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,920
to do that but you might need rules or

1040
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,480
at least some guidance from the GM to

1041
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,400
say take that seriously you know because

1042
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,680
that can very easily drift into the

1043
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,440
realm of yeah that's just a joke you

1044
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,079
know um

1045
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,839
>> rockiss rock paper scissors you know

1046
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,200
it's like that that could mechanic that

1047
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,760
that could be a mechanic for a fist

1048
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,480
fight for instance you know or or just a

1049
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,839
fist do you succeed in avoiding that

1050
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,839
>> nerf guns

1051
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,800
>> Nerf guns things games of

1052
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,960
>> shoot pieces of plastic dice.

1053
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,880
>> Odds or something.

1054
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
>> Odds and evens. Yeah. Okay.

1055
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,359
>> Health tokens like football.

1056
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,720
>> Say what?

1057
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,960
>> Health tokens like in fact football.

1058
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,240
>> Give me some more detail.

1059
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,320
>> Tokens football.

1060
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,839
>> I mean like in if someone has like a

1061
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,800
certain number of like flags and so you

1062
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,320
hurt them by taking one.

1063
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,720
>> Oh, I see. So like you might have like

1064
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,400
multiple flags for instance. Okay. Yeah,

1065
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,720
that's an idea. Yeah, it's like a health

1066
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,720
bar almost. Okay.

1067
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,720
Uh

1068
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,640
>> uh so CR ratings, dice rolling and or

1069
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,200
sorry ratings, dice rolling and puffers.

1070
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,599
>> Yeah. So so dice dice rolling in sort of

1071
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,160
the general term of like things

1072
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,920
randomizing uh numbers. In fact, rock

1073
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,040
paper is kind of randomizing thing

1074
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,599
almost. Um and then you have like toy

1075
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,520
weapons, right? you know um probably not

1076
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,319
so relevant for the V uh for the Yin

1077
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,440
virus but you could imagine

1078
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,440
a setting up a room full of foam things

1079
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,000
and which you will be quite happy to

1080
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,760
throw at each other. You know that this

1081
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,920
cylinder of foam of pipe insulating

1082
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,560
material is not going to hurt anyone

1083
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,079
when you throw that. Um which makes it

1084
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,839
more likely that I'm going to pick it up

1085
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,200
and throw it at someone. you know, it's

1086
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,359
like clearly it's something that was

1087
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,839
designed for me to throw that the GMs

1088
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,599
put there. Um, and if you want your

1089
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,920
players to be engaging in that kind of

1090
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,280
activity, that is technically you could

1091
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,079
have put a real bottle there. You could

1092
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,079
have put a real bug or or a computer or

1093
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,440
something like that. Um, there's no

1094
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,119
reason why you as a GM couldn't, but

1095
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,240
they are deliberately deciding to put

1096
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,040
something fake there to clue the player

1097
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,040
into maybe there is something I can do

1098
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,480
with that that I wouldn't necessarily

1099
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,760
want to do if it was a real thing. I

1100
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
wouldn't want to throw a real bottle at

1101
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,280
somebody, but I could easily throw a

1102
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:01,599
full model at somebody. Um, same thing

1103
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,280
for uh for Nerf I mean for Nerf guns,

1104
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,960
dart guns, this guns, you know, it's

1105
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,880
like you put this something with a

1106
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,640
trigger and somebody's hands going to

1107
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,560
launch a little cheap piece of of

1108
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,599
plastic at someone that they're itching

1109
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,599
for a chance to use it. Uh really

1110
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:21,280
um um let's see

1111
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,640
what else. Dice are difficult. Uh the

1112
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,640
problem with dice is you kind of need a

1113
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,800
flat surface to roll it on and you may

1114
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,560
not you might not have that and

1115
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,839
>> much more frequently people do card

1116
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,760
drawing. So you have to get

1117
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,000
>> card of currency.

1118
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,280
>> Still a little bit risky. It could end

1119
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,640
up going all over the floor.

1120
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,119
>> Another thing that I've seen people do

1121
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,040
is um some kind of resource management

1122
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,920
style thing where essentially you have

1123
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,839
like set of like might cards or

1124
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,839
something you might have three of them.

1125
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,200
You can win a challenge by just by

1126
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,720
giving one to the other player that

1127
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,359
you're you're fighting with.

1128
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,560
>> Mhm.

1129
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,079
>> And then kind of when you run out of

1130
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,440
them, you can't like overpower people

1131
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,640
anymore. So

1132
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,960
>> So it's like the amount of energy I've

1133
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,160
got.

1134
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,800
>> Yeah. It's like the amount of energy

1135
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,200
you've got.

1136
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,160
>> Yep.

1137
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,680
>> And also if you discard them or give

1138
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,560
them to another player, then it's kind

1139
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:09,440
of the difference between

1140
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,200
these things are just gone and the they

1141
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,280
kind of circle circulate around.

1142
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,400
>> There's a limited amount of resource.

1143
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,319
>> Yeah. Yeah. So if there's the

1144
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,920
circulation thing then you can get

1145
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,280
whooped a few times but after being

1146
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,440
whooped then suddenly you get a chance

1147
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,560
to whoop back

1148
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,720
>> then it becomes

1149
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,400
>> well that that one's interesting um this

1150
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,520
is the this is the biggest point that I

1151
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,119
want to talk about which is just

1152
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,800
competition

1153
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,200
you know a term that you guys are

1154
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,520
already very familiar with but you know

1155
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,119
at what point do your game mechanics

1156
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,520
are you designing your game mechanics

1157
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,240
not necessarily to enhance the reality

1158
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,920
ism or to encourage certain behaviors or

1159
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,920
to give the player enough information

1160
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,920
about what they're allowed to do or what

1161
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,839
they should be doing and you're just

1162
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,880
going into the realm of how do I make

1163
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,880
this competitively interesting. Um, real

1164
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,480
fights if you've taken a bunch of blows,

1165
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,440
you do not get stronger. But from a game

1166
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,319
point of view, well, well, if a Bruce

1167
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,400
Banner maybe I

1168
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,240
but you know, but from a from a

1169
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,040
competitive point of view or at least

1170
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,440
from a game play traditional gameplay

1171
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,359
point of view, that sounds like a great

1172
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,200
idea. You know, it gets you back into

1173
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,680
the game. Uh whereas um you know,

1174
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,280
whereas any very realistic fight

1175
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,119
mechanic is really probably going to be

1176
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,720
a positive feedback mechanic. you win,

1177
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,359
you you keep winning. Um

1178
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,280
so so you can think of these five

1179
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,680
different things as you know

1180
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,440
not not it's not like game balance but

1181
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,200
these are decisions that you have to

1182
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,319
make either as an individual designer or

1183
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,720
as a team about what any given mechanic

1184
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,880
in your game is trying to accomplish.

1185
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,960
It's you is rarely mutually exclusive.

1186
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,640
It's usually trying to hit multiple one

1187
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,920
of these things. You don't want to fall

1188
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,920
down on any of these things, especially

1189
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,520
not feasibility. You know, it's like,

1190
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,680
yes, this is the perfect game mechanic

1191
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,480
if we had two years to be able to put

1192
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,720
together this uh all all the things that

1193
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,800
that we had. Um, and there are games

1194
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,760
that have failed to run because of that

1195
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,119
idea. Um, especially uh live action

1196
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,240
games that have a hidden computer

1197
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,920
component uh very rap especially if

1198
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,160
they're designed by MIT students,

1199
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,640
rapidly designed into a software

1200
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,119
engineering project that never finishes.

1201
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,680
um and the the game kind of disappears

1202
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,760
and it's all about this damn website. Um

1203
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,280
that won't have solved everything else.

1204
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,640
You know, it's completely realistic

1205
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,440
because it's a hacking mechanic. It

1206
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,359
actually happens on a computer and the

1207
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,800
skills scale to your ability as a

1208
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,800
character which the computer already

1209
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,440
knows and you don't have to remember

1210
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,440
because so you can feel really neat and

1211
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,880
it's competitive because it's like you

1212
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,160
know you know what your opponents are

1213
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,839
doing but not everything that you're

1214
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,319
doing and it's going to take us five

1215
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,839
years to write this code. Never game's

1216
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,240
never going to happen. So,

1217
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,480
so let's see. Let me think of other

1218
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,000
examples just to sort of uh put some

1219
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,440
ideas in your head. Um,

1220
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,720
back to the idea of things that you

1221
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,119
might be that players might be

1222
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,640
uncomfortable doing with each other. Uh,

1223
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,240
seduction is one of those things that's

1224
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,760
if you don't have a game mechanic for

1225
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:22,480
it, it never happens in the way that you

1226
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,480
want it to. uh and that that that helps

1227
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,560
the game. You know, if it happens, it's

1228
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,839
happening between the players and that

1229
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,560
causes all kinds of problems to the

1230
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,800
game. Um so you so you come up with a

1231
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,640
rule, come up with a game mechanic that

1232
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,720
feels nothing like real life seduction.

1233
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,480
We're going to play a game of blackjack

1234
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,240
now. If we win, you're now in love with

1235
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,040
me, you know? It's like that's not how

1236
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,040
seduction actually works. But it

1237
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,760
actually makes it easier for players to

1238
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,119
say I can I can do that. I can play a

1239
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,480
game of blackjack. There's no social

1240
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,839
awkwardness in playing a game.

1241
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,720
>> I mean, you can associate that with

1242
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,960
like, hm, I I win this game, so I

1243
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,480
slipped I slipped inside your glass a

1244
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,880
love potion, so now you're in love with

1245
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,839
me.

1246
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,480
>> Yeah.

1247
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,640
>> Something like that.

1248
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,839
>> Yeah. I mean that that's but you see in

1249
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,359
that particular case you're describing

1250
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,440
uh

1251
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,480
you're describing an action that people

1252
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,920
might be more actually willing to do uh

1253
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,680
through some sort of simple mechanic

1254
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,119
like okay instead of love potion we're

1255
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,880
going to mechanic that with maple syrup

1256
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,119
or something you know we're going to

1257
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,480
actually give you a vial and if and if

1258
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,880
you drink something in the game that

1259
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,880
tastes like maple syrup talk to a GM

1260
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,319
because you probably just to drank some

1261
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,319
some magical potion. Um, but if you're

1262
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,680
going to if if if the goal is all right,

1263
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,000
you're playing in a film no more game

1264
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,000
and you're supposed to ex you're

1265
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,640
supposed to be engaging in constant

1266
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,560
witty banter lead anyway.

1267
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,440
A lot of people have a lot of difficulty

1268
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,119
with with with with that. Sometimes they

1269
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,079
sometimes it works. I I I've made it

1270
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,240
work in some games. uh but uh it makes

1271
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,000
it a lot easier if the success or

1272
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:01,280
failure in that is not going to be

1273
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,839
bottlenecked by whether the players feel

1274
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,520
comfortable doing it, you know. So

1275
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,480
creating a game mechanic that actually

1276
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,800
feels a little bit less than what what

1277
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,960
activity you're trying to to to

1278
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,880
represent uh may make it easier for

1279
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,480
people to engage in in the activity. The

1280
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,680
same thing goes in combat. Playing rock

1281
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,160
paper scissors feels nothing like an

1282
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,599
actual fight. But people will be much

1283
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,640
more willing to play rock paper scissors

1284
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,000
with each other than to punch each

1285
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,200
other. So, you know, come up with that

1286
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,720
rule. You know, give them a little

1287
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,119
plastic gun, give them something to make

1288
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,079
it easier, and they'll be willing to

1289
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,800
engage in that activity more often.

1290
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,599
Uh, violence will probably be the thing

1291
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,599
that comes up a lot in the next segment.

1292
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,599
Um,

1293
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:53,280
so

1294
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:57,119
let me see what else we can get into.

1295
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:02,000
Um, how many of folks here have played

1296
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,520
some variant of Mafia or Werewolf or

1297
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,079
Okay.

1298
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,760
Um, who's who's played Mafia in

1299
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,920
particular? Okay. Who's played Werewolf?

1300
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,200
Okay.

1301
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,359
Um, so, um, those are live action games,

1302
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,119
too. And those are live action games

1303
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:23,920
that specifically don't try to draw too

1304
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,200
sharp a division between who you are and

1305
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,599
who your player is.

1306
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,599
>> You're you're given a role that's, you

1307
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,000
know, that that that's a card that

1308
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,000
basically says whether you're mafia or

1309
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,520
whether you're you're you're a villager.

1310
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,400
I think those are

1311
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,880
>> civilian,

1312
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,040
>> right? And the whole idea is that

1313
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,040
everybody who's that that's a character

1314
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,040
sheet that tells you that gives you

1315
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,040
private secret information about the

1316
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,240
role that you're supposed to play. But

1317
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,760
that's in my opinion those these

1318
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,160
particular games and we're going to play

1319
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:00,559
uh some variants of them. Um they are

1320
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,920
there what what you are told by the

1321
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,000
cards is only what you're allowed to do.

1322
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,480
What actually gives you the role is what

1323
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,040
you decide to do. It's what it's like

1324
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,240
I'm playing mafia and I'm going to say

1325
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,240
Patrick gets you know you know and other

1326
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,760
people in in in a room agree with me and

1327
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,760
you know Patrick's character gets taken

1328
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,079
out of the game. That decision is the

1329
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,839
decision that actually made me and

1330
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,000
that's and that decision is the decision

1331
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,240
that other people are trying to catch

1332
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,440
cuz that's because that's why you know

1333
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,040
that the the they're trying to find a

1334
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,640
person who's actually responsible for

1335
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,200
various acts when everybody's eyes are

1336
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,880
closed. Um the general model for these

1337
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,559
games is you know there are cycles there

1338
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,559
for werewolf is a day and night cycle

1339
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,079
and for mafia it's also day and night

1340
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,800
but the idea is that um during the night

1341
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,040
everybody who's not mafia gets to have

1342
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,599
their eyes open uh everybody who is

1343
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,119
mafia sorry everybody who's not m mafia

1344
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,079
keeps their eyes closed everybody who is

1345
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,240
mafia keeps their eyes open and the

1346
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,880
people who are mafia can communicate

1347
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,000
through some GN mediator some game

1348
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,160
master mediated way to specify a player

1349
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,400
to be taken out of the game. It's point.

1350
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,200
It's usually a point. Yeah.

1351
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,079
>> Uh I I I I've seen things with links

1352
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,680
with with because as the GM moves around

1353
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,440
sometimes that gives you clues because

1354
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:28,400
you can hear even with your eyes closed

1355
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:30,880
you can hear where the GM is. Um but uh

1356
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,559
the and and then and then you then

1357
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,640
that's like the night cycle and then

1358
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,440
during the day cycle everyone opens

1359
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,440
their eyes and then the whoever's been

1360
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,160
taken out of the game you know is is is

1361
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,400
informs you and everyone knows and then

1362
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,400
everyone starts discussing and accusing

1363
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,240
each other of being responsible for it.

1364
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,760
And the whole point of the game is uh

1365
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,119
for the villagers to identify who all

1366
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,400
the mafia is before everyone in the

1367
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:57,359
village does. Um

1368
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,280
so um

1369
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,440
you know that's a it's a live action

1370
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,960
game that doesn't have a lot of action I

1371
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,559
would say. You know this is one action

1372
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,720
which is closing well there closing your

1373
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,480
eyes opening your eyes and it's pointing

1374
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,200
um uh there are variants where uh

1375
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,040
sometimes there is a this godfather

1376
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,440
there's a I've seen websites with whole

1377
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,920
list of different roles that are just

1378
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,119
ridiculous like this gravekeeper

1379
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,319
necromancer or something like

1380
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,000
>> yeah it's like there's like people can

1381
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,880
bring characters back back from the dead

1382
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,599
there people who can basically do a

1383
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,319
background check you know I think that

1384
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,280
angels I've heard of angels in cops

1385
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:37,359
um who have, you know, and then you you

1386
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,280
go from two cycles to three cycles per

1387
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,280
round, you know, four cycles per round

1388
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,880
where different people have eyes open

1389
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,680
and you get different bits of

1390
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,960
information about what what's in the

1391
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,680
what what the world stated is like, you

1392
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,440
know, the fact that killing somebody is

1393
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,119
pointing at them, you know, that's

1394
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,240
that's a dissociation mechanic, right?

1395
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,119
It's not that you're actually being

1396
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,640
asked to engage in physical combat with

1397
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,079
with with them even though the fiction

1398
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,520
of the game is that you're assassinating

1399
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,079
this person in a build tonight. Um

1400
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,240
but uh the very similitude I would

1401
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,839
imagine and and compet and competition

1402
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,520
largely comes down in the discussion

1403
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:18,079
phase. You know, they're trying to

1404
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,400
put players in an environment where you

1405
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,280
got a paranoid group of villagers, a

1406
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,319
paranoid town, and they're all mutually

1407
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:30,640
exclusing uh uh uh mutually ex accusing

1408
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:34,319
each other. And um both the the act of

1409
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:37,520
trying to not be accused and trying to

1410
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:40,800
deduce who is the right person to accuse

1411
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,359
um is a compelling competitive

1412
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,000
experience. That that's what all these

1413
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:48,400
games are really about. Um so all the

1414
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,599
emphasis is all all the time of the game

1415
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,280
frankly is devoted to that phase of when

1416
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,280
everyone sits down and discusses with

1417
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,760
each other who could be the mafia in

1418
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,839
this in this environment. You want to um

1419
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,119
walk us through one of the the the

1420
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,559
variants maybe?

1421
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,240
>> Yeah. Do you want to like actually play

1422
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,200
it or just describe it?

1423
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:10,160
>> Uh if it we have one, two, three, four,

1424
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,680
five, six, seven, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

1425
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,920
14.

1426
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,640
>> We could have two groups or one big

1427
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,839
group. One big group will rest. Yeah,

1428
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:22,160
take a while. Yeah,

1429
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:23,839
>> let's let's do two two groups, but how

1430
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,680
many different rule variants do we

1431
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,800
>> Well, I I only found one I thought was

1432
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,640
really interesting. Although we can

1433
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,000
certainly like even the Wikipedia page

1434
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,839
has a million variants. We

1435
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,440
>> could the one I normally would play

1436
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,359
would be the one where there's there's

1437
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,559
mafia and there's cops. Maybe there

1438
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,440
might be a medic, but

1439
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,559
>> inspector angel and prostitute. Oh, I

1440
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,920
was

1441
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,280
>> Where's the pro?

1442
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,240
>> If you sleep with the mafia, they don't

1443
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,160
tell anybody. If you sleep with

1444
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,520
inspector, they get incorrect

1445
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,040
information. If you sleep with the

1446
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,640
nurse, they don't heal.

1447
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,559
That's just the most interesting

1448
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,000
prostitute rules that I've heard so far.

1449
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,440
This this is why it's very important to

1450
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,800
make sure that you know what rules that

1451
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,839
you're playing with before the game

1452
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,520
starts.

1453
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,119
>> Um so so walk us through the rules and

1454
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,240
then what we'll do is we'll break this

1455
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:11,920
into two groups. Uh and we'll have two

1456
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:15,599
groups play separately and uh

1457
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,240
uh that's probably the end of the class

1458
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,920
activity.

1459
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,960
>> Yeah. Well, so I had I had found a

1460
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,200
variant today called thing, which is

1461
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,559
based on the John Carpenter movie, which

1462
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,359
it seems interesting because it takes

1463
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,839
out one of the roles. The idea is um one

1464
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,839
person is the shape-shifting thing and

1465
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:35,040
at night they infect someone else and

1466
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,839
that person becomes a thing as well. So

1467
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,599
they're not knocked outright.

1468
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:42,800
And then during the day, the group votes

1469
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,720
and decides on one person to test. And

1470
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,599
if they test a thing, that person is

1471
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,200
killed and they get to test another one.

1472
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,760
>> And the idea is the things are trying to

1473
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,960
outnumber the people,

1474
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,799
>> which to me sounds interesting because

1475
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,880
it takes away that kind of inspector

1476
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:00,559
role.

1477
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,240
>> Do you do you know who gets thing in the

1478
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,680
middle of the night or like just

1479
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,760
>> So I was I was thinking about this. What

1480
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,760
you would need is like for the person

1481
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,440
who's the thing to kind of indicate to

1482
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,599
the moderator and then maybe the

1483
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,319
moderator could tap them or something

1484
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,359
and just

1485
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,160
>> Okay. So, if you're a thing, you know,

1486
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,720
you're a thing.

1487
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,640
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1488
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,079
>> Okay.

1489
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,040
>> Yeah. The things are spreading as

1490
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,280
opposed to just

1491
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,640
>> then if there's two things, do they both

1492
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,240
agree on another

1493
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,520
>> presumably the only So, this is really

1494
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,480
interesting because apparently it's

1495
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,240
played at like um this conference for

1496
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,079
science fiction writers.

1497
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,520
>> So, there's little snippets of it on the

1498
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,440
web about

1499
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,799
um the rules from like different blogs

1500
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,079
and stuff and it sounds interesting but

1501
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:42,839
of course the problem is how do you

1502
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,839
Google for mafia thing

1503
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,280
>> but it sound interesting to me and then

1504
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,559
it seems like there's

1505
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,079
>> probably the thing mafia

1506
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,240
>> to try and like trust me I spent a while

1507
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,520
>> so it might be fun actually to have two

1508
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,359
groups figure out how to play that game

1509
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,960
just from the description that you just

1510
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,160
given I mean I think if we split this

1511
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,000
path to two there's going to be enough

1512
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,880
people who traditional mafia to know how

1513
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,480
that works and uh and then we'll just

1514
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,280
reconvene at the end of it to see

1515
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,599
whether what each version people came up

1516
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,079
with uh what what were the similarities

1517
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,680
and what were the differences. Um again

1518
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,880
that's the flexibility of doing a live

1519
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,079
action game where the people who

1520
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,160
actually coming up with the rules are

1521
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,760
actually in the rule the same rule as

1522
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,000
the players or or the players

1523
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,319
themselves. You get to make stuff up on

1524
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,839
on the fly as long as everyone agrees.

1525
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,520
Um

1526
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,480
so let's give that a shot. Um while

1527
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,359
while uh uh Jason is sorting out the

1528
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,240
cards, any questions about the stuff

1529
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:42,319
that we Yeah.

1530
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,640
So

1531
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:47,599
the two biggest challenges that I come

1532
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,680
across in coming up with like good

1533
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,720
mechanics

1534
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,720
have to do with

1535
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,559
social challenges and and like

1536
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,839
intellectual skill.

1537
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,359
>> So um let's go with intellectual. So,

1538
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,799
it's easy to play a character that's

1539
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,079
stupid than you. It's really hard to

1540
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,040
play a character that's smarter than

1541
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,960
you.

1542
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,960
>> And it's and in particular, it's really

1543
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,680
hard to play a character that's smarter

1544
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:15,520
than you if you don't have a GM around

1545
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,680
all the time to tell you

1546
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,079
>> stuff. Yeah.

1547
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,760
>> So, I don't know if you have any ideas

1548
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,119
about how to deal with that. No, the

1549
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,720
other one is um arbitrating social

1550
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,799
social conflicts. Like this is this is

1551
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,839
hard in any role playing game. Mhm.

1552
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:33,520
>> Um because it feels like if you want to

1553
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,119
be able to persuade a character of

1554
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,119
something, you just want to persuade

1555
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,640
them because you're role playing, right?

1556
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,160
>> But you're supposed to be playing a

1557
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,599
character who is more persuasive than

1558
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,000
you.

1559
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,480
>> Um but it feels really cheap.

1560
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,559
>> Mhm.

1561
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,599
>> Um if you can just sort of

1562
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,359
>> you believe me,

1563
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,119
>> you believe.

1564
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,920
>> This also ties in with a with another

1565
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,359
issue which frequently pops up in in LS

1566
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,400
and role playing games in general, which

1567
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,960
is like use of metagate knowledge. Mhm.

1568
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,920
>> So frequently if you've been persuaded

1569
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,640
to do something, then you come across

1570
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,400
players who know using their metag game

1571
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,400
knowledge that they don't want to do the

1572
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,599
thing that they've been mechanically

1573
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,280
forced to do.

1574
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,240
>> So they try and find loopholes

1575
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,000
constantly.

1576
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,680
>> Um I don't know if you can really force

1577
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,359
people to abandon their navigating

1578
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,960
knowledge mechanically,

1579
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,400
>> but uh I don't know.

1580
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,680
if you have any behavioral

1581
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,440
>> I I I I have some examples on how the

1582
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,520
Assassin's Guild in particular has dealt

1583
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:35,760
with that. Um and um and in some ways

1584
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,520
it's cheating because they they decide

1585
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,680
in some in some we're not going to try

1586
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,760
to do some of those things. Um in

1587
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,079
particular, let's take persuasion for

1588
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,559
one of those things. Um the I the

1589
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:50,079
problem with persuasion is that whatever

1590
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,599
mechanic you come to use other than what

1591
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,640
you see is what you get. you know, it's

1592
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,920
like, well, if you manage to persuade

1593
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,359
someone to do it, then I'll get

1594
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,920
persuaded. Um, any other mechanic that

1595
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,280
you come up with has runs that risk of

1596
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,440
the wait a minute, this is not what I

1597
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,960
really really want want to do. So, um,

1598
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,960
the assassin skill has replaced that

1599
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,520
with brainwashing, which is the whole

1600
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,920
idea of you are not being persuaded, you

1601
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,520
are being forcibly your goals are being

1602
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:21,359
forcibly changed, but now you have other

1603
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:24,720
goals and that's the big difference. um

1604
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,799
uh you now have your old goals are no

1605
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,280
longer your win conditions. Your new

1606
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:31,359
goals are now your win conditions and

1607
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,599
you can still win the game by obeying

1608
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,319
your new goals. So, um

1609
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,160
>> that's cool.

1610
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,880
>> Yeah, that's that's the brainwashing

1611
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,640
mechanics,

1612
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,559
>> right? It kind of aligns the interests

1613
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,079
of the player with the interests of the

1614
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,760
character. Yeah, it's like you want to

1615
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:47,040
you you you want to go with your new

1616
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,119
goals now because uh and then um how

1617
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,720
this came up typically uh in the

1618
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,799
Assassin's Guild, the Assassin's Guild

1619
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,720
actually grew out from Circle of Death

1620
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,079
games, which is kind of like getting to

1621
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,680
know you. I've got a name of somebody

1622
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,160
and I need to shoot them with this water

1623
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,359
gun. Uh who's this person again? I don't

1624
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,559
know. I'm a freshman. I haven't met

1625
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,599
everybody on campus. I'm going to figure

1626
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,599
out who this person is. That's where

1627
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,720
those games came uh uh came from. The

1628
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,599
assassin skill kind of grew out from

1629
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:13,040
that. Then they became teams. Um, and

1630
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,799
brainwashing was basically the game the

1631
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,400
set of game mechanics that were used for

1632
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,920
recruiting people into your team. You

1633
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,319
know, it's like, all right, everyone's

1634
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,559
got one target, but there are a few

1635
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:25,920
people out there whose job is destroy

1636
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,520
everybody on this opposing faction, but

1637
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,880
there's only one person in that opposing

1638
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,640
faction right now. There's only one of

1639
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,160
me, but I have this brainwashing

1640
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,799
mechanic that recruits more and more

1641
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,880
people. So what you thought was one uh

1642
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:39,359
I'm just against another individual

1643
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,520
becomes a my group is against that

1644
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:43,040
group. Um and it comes it feels pretty

1645
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,200
awesome actually because what it

1646
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,480
actually feels it's it's a weird game

1647
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:50,000
mechanic way of making your character

1648
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,720
have some sort of development in the

1649
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,040
game because if you think about a role

1650
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:57,680
playing game character development means

1651
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,280
your goals now change somehow. But it's

1652
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,680
really really difficult for players to

1653
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,680
give players a a means of doing that

1654
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,119
themselves. Brainwashing was one of the

1655
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,440
few ways that seems to actually have

1656
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,200
worked as I'm actively going to knock

1657
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,520
out this character, put this blicky

1658
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,280
helmet on them for 5 seconds, and if

1659
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,440
nobody catches me in this process, I

1660
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,520
give them new goals and the person who's

1661
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,040
reading it, dude, this is way more

1662
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,200
exciting than anything I was doing

1663
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:25,599
earlier. You know, um and um you also

1664
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,119
avoid the metag game problem of loyalty,

1665
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,599
right? It's like, "Yeah, I've got this

1666
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,040
information from this other group, but

1667
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,480
I've been brainwashed. I don't want to

1668
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,920
tell you." It's like, "No, if you want

1669
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,559
to tell me now, because it's actually

1670
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:40,160
going to help you win." Um, but

1671
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:42,400
metagaming um in the in live action role

1672
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,400
playing games, all kinds of live action

1673
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,680
games is a big thing is that you know

1674
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,200
things about the player that or you know

1675
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,760
things about the games that they not

1676
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,880
really supposed to know. You know, if a

1677
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,880
person is supposed to be able to

1678
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,799
teleport from one end of campus to the

1679
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,079
other end of campus, unfort the

1680
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:59,440
character may be able to do that, the

1681
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,839
damn player is going to walk all the way

1682
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,839
in between. Uh, and you happen to run a

1683
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:05,119
player halfway. I now know that that

1684
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,119
player is probably on this side of

1685
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,040
campus. Uh, even though they your

1686
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,799
character really had no idea on how to

1687
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:14,079
deal with that. That's just one of those

1688
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:16,079
like um there are game mechanic designed

1689
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,000
there are ways to design game mechanics

1690
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,240
to sort of avoid those situations but in

1691
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,599
many many live action role playing there

1692
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,359
is a there is a honor system that really

1693
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,960
has to kick in. The nice thing about it

1694
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,720
is that if everyone decides to go by the

1695
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,559
honor system and agrees that that this

1696
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,359
honor system is necessary for the world

1697
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,760
to be reinforced um it actually helps

1698
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:37,680
reinforce that mutual

1699
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,760
illusion that this world is real. you

1700
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,880
know by by by by saying I know that I'm

1701
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:46,319
not supposed to know this thing but I am

1702
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,960
going to play this game as hard as I can

1703
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:50,559
in uh in a way that does not take

1704
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,559
advantage of that information actually

1705
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,240
reinforces the world for everybody else

1706
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:57,039
it's the same thing for improv theater

1707
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:00,960
you know it's like um anyone here

1708
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:04,319
involved in improv improv comedy ro yeah

1709
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,520
so you know yes and sure so you know

1710
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:08,640
what what's what's what's the basic

1711
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,119
concept behind that Um, yes. And is an

1712
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:14,240
idea where if you give someone an offer,

1713
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:18,079
they'll take your offer. Uh, so if I

1714
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:21,520
say, "Man, we're all out of tomatoes."

1715
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:23,760
Someone will say, "Yes, and the big

1716
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,280
tomato cookoff is tomorrow," or

1717
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,240
something like this. You cannot

1718
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,520
contradict what was said.

1719
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,039
>> Yeah. Not only do you not contradict,

1720
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,480
you all you always add information.

1721
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,280
Every line, at least in the beginning of

1722
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,280
the scene, you should be adding

1723
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,720
information to the scene. And then after

1724
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,200
a few lines, you have very very

1725
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,079
elaborate setup that's kind of

1726
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,559
ridiculous.

1727
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,400
>> Yeah.

1728
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,280
>> But mutually shared.

1729
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,319
>> Exactly.

1730
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,400
>> So, so in that same that same situation

1731
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,839
of like metagaming is one of those

1732
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,000
things that's actively working to

1733
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:53,119
destroy the reality of your world and as

1734
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,280
all of your if all your players agree to

1735
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,559
try the damn hardest to not let it

1736
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,000
interfere with the world. that actually

1737
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:02,319
strengthens uh the illusion um in a way

1738
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,400
that it strengthens the scene for for

1739
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,880
improv theater.

1740
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,640
Um hold on just just one second. There

1741
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,319
was the other concern that you had

1742
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,480
before the persuasion issue which was

1743
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:17,839
characters who

1744
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,000
in particular this comes up a lot in

1745
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,599
superhero type situations what have you

1746
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,960
where you have somebody who's either a

1747
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,839
super genius or

1748
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,119
>> so abilities that are just much better

1749
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:32,440
than you

1750
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:34,000
>> and like how to do mechanic that

1751
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,559
[Music]

1752
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,559
>> the best way that you can do that is to

1753
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:44,079
the right person. But uh what I've

1754
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:46,000
generally found is is that old role

1755
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,839
playing game chestnut of separating

1756
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,280
intelligence from wisdom makes it a

1757
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:50,640
little bit easier. You know, there's

1758
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,400
intelligence which is your ability to

1759
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,960
think on the feet. It is wisdom which is

1760
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:58,559
how much you know about the world. Um

1761
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:01,359
and if you are as if you in as a game

1762
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,520
master designing a game can figure out

1763
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:05,359
when I say someone's really smart, what

1764
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,280
do I mean? Intelligence or wisdom? It

1765
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:09,359
helps you a little bit on thinking what

1766
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,240
how I can use game mechanics or gamew

1767
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:15,200
writing to uh to fix that problem. So if

1768
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,520
it's intelligence, it's just like um I

1769
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,079
have the ability to do stuff that other

1770
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,960
people can't do because I am so smart

1771
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:26,000
and you can literally just give them

1772
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,760
abilities to act on things that other

1773
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,680
people do not have that people just

1774
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,599
don't have. I am able to build a

1775
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,480
telephone out of this co because I'm the

1776
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,400
freaking professor of pilot, you know.

1777
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,599
uh quite smart, you know, it's like

1778
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,039
doesn't mean that I act have to act

1779
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,799
terribly smart if I'm capable of doing

1780
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,319
things that other people can't because I

1781
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,079
have I've been told specifically I have

1782
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,200
these abilities. But that's like the

1783
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,240
intelligence side of things. The wisdom

1784
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,160
side of things is a little bit harder

1785
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,160
which is basically you dump you dump a

1786
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,400
whole bunch of information on somebody

1787
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,240
and you hope that they are capable of

1788
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,640
making the associations between what's

1789
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,200
happening in game and what they read in.

1790
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,079
That's a lot harder. Um it's it is a

1791
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,599
problem but uh but I find that by

1792
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,799
separating those two it makes it makes

1793
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,920
it a slightly easier problem.

1794
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:09,599
>> Uh Patrick um

1795
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,720
>> yeah this is a bit of a notice question.

1796
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:15,359
Uh are LARs usually played in real time?

1797
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,599
>> Typically um they have rules about when

1798
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:20,319
to hit the pause button. Basically uh in

1799
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,880
MIT those are usually enacted when

1800
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:26,079
safety becomes an issue. um people are

1801
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,760
running too fast. Uh somebody just fell

1802
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,760
down and you want to be able to stop

1803
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:33,039
everyone from running, you know, and so

1804
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:35,119
they so they shout halt. Um but

1805
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:39,280
typically they have they're happening in

1806
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:41,520
real time because it's really hard to do

1807
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,720
turnbased stuff that doesn't quickly

1808
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,319
feel like a board game.

1809
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,200
>> I mean like when you uh when you say

1810
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,160
someone would want to do like a

1811
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,760
background check and you say I don't

1812
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,839
know come back in two hours, but you

1813
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,520
literally was like two hours. So yeah,

1814
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:53,440
it's it's it's like often that that

1815
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,880
literally means just two hours. And and

1816
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,880
and that's an interesting thing of the

1817
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,359
it's real time, but it's kind of a time

1818
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,920
delay at the same time. And so so you as

1819
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:04,160
a as a game master, you can build in

1820
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,400
game mechanics that take advantage of

1821
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,839
real-time delays to be able to give you

1822
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,799
give you as a game master some time to

1823
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:13,760
breathe. Uh typically they're happening

1824
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:16,239
in real time. Uh, I wrote a game where

1825
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:19,600
no where the clock stopped somewhere

1826
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:22,239
between midnight and 8:00 a.m. like like

1827
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,920
the like the game world literally froze.

1828
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,480
Well, not literally figuratively froze

1829
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:30,400
at 12

1830
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:33,199
and um and and 1 minute after 8, the

1831
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,759
clock will practically uh in game terms

1832
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:37,040
have moved one one one minute even

1833
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,040
though there were eight in the meeting

1834
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,920
hours in three so that people could go

1835
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,400
and take a break. Um,

1836
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,480
so which will be great for like an army

1837
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,560
of darkness type type of scenario,

1838
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,600
right? Because those three people I

1839
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,440
don't know how familiar people are with

1840
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,759
the dark time, but those three films are

1841
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,759
supposed to all happen like within 48

1842
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,560
hours.

1843
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,199
>> Um, so Andrew and I just are moving

1844
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,040
across.

1845
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:02,560
>> So I guess two good things. One is in

1846
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,839
terms of wisdom, could you possibly have

1847
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,920
little note cards start flipped over

1848
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,440
everywhere and then the wisdom person or

1849
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,199
person with high wisdom could read about

1850
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,520
like information in there?

1851
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:13,440
>> You could you you you could certainly

1852
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,719
have you know take advantage of oh you

1853
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,920
know if you have piece of paper tape on

1854
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,759
the wall just put them on the back right

1855
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,120
you know it's like some people can are

1856
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,759
given the ability to read the back of

1857
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,440
the paper some people aren't uh which

1858
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,440
will be a little bit easier than trying

1859
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,120
to keep it all in your head at once. Um,

1860
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,880
you can also give very limited wisdom

1861
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,440
like the whole like the psychic example,

1862
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,839
right? You know, I I am sensitive in

1863
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:38,400
some way. I can tell when certain things

1864
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:40,560
are cursed uh by giving them clues on

1865
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:43,120
printed pieces of paper that nobody else

1866
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,600
knows how to interpret. You know, like I

1867
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,679
see this there is a there is a number

1868
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,520
associated with each one of these rooms.

1869
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,600
If that number happens to be even, this

1870
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,000
is not a place that that any sane person

1871
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,280
will want to be, you know, and there are

1872
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,239
people who have the wisdom to tell that

1873
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,600
and there are some people who don't. Um,

1874
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:03,600
so that that's another way that you can

1875
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:09,280
put little environmental clues. uh

1876
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:11,199
the there are in particularly um in MIT

1877
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,600
the sort of like hiding clues in plain

1878
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:17,040
sight uh and every single way that you

1879
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:20,320
can possibly do that uh is uh is really

1880
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:23,760
exploited. So the numbers for instance I

1881
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,360
I've seen games where where everyone has

1882
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,040
like five digits on their badge and

1883
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:31,120
every single one of those digits means

1884
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,640
something if you happen to be the you

1885
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,120
happen to have the ability to interpret

1886
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:38,400
that but each one of those digits means

1887
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:40,640
something different. Um, so that's an

1888
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,159
example.

1889
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,400
>> And just really quickly, in terms of

1890
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,199
space, how much space do like Assassin's

1891
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,159
Gild?

1892
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:50,640
>> Assassin Guilds. MIT Assassin's Guild

1893
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:53,840
has the advantage of the MIT campus. So

1894
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,960
it it can go anywhere from uh main

1895
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:02,320
campus uh you know by Mass F and A

1896
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:04,640
Street to all of freaking campus. Uh but

1897
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,320
players hear that. Players walking all

1898
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,159
the way across campus. it kills their

1899
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,880
feet. Uh so um often it just turns out

1900
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:15,199
to be the few rooms that they could res

1901
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,120
could get room reservations for MIT

1902
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,040
campus activities complex and the sort

1903
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,880
of general vicinity around there. Um

1904
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,040
outdoors is really not used much because

1905
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,640
MIT Assassin's C loves shooting little

1906
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:28,679
plastic things at each other and with

1907
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,679
the wind blows that just sucks.

1908
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:35,679
Can you tell us a story or anecdotes of

1909
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,480
games that have like gone really

1910
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,800
horribly slash fallen apart

1911
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,800
>> and just how much time have we got and

1912
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,960
then just more specifically highlight

1913
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,440
like what are the like mistakes that

1914
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,040
made everyone who's doing these

1915
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,560
especially MIT they're all smart people

1916
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,480
and they're written by smart people so

1917
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,080
what kinds of mistakes do smart people

1918
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,199
still make that result in these games

1919
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,120
like falling apart

1920
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:59,199
>> well or or or bad things

1921
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,280
>> the most common thing that happens is

1922
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:04,640
not even an issue of how smart the game

1923
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,239
writers were, but how much experience

1924
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,080
they've had in seeing things go horribly

1925
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,679
wrong. Um,

1926
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,600
>> and I'm asking

1927
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,920
>> just as this class, you know, has given

1928
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,920
you experience making games, you've seen

1929
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:19,199
how some projects can go wrong, a lot of

1930
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,120
it is just system dynamics, right? You

1931
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,719
know, it's like I put together a bunch

1932
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,440
of rules and I did not expect those

1933
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:27,199
rules to interact in that way. But

1934
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:30,560
because a live action game is difficult

1935
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,920
to run multiple times, uh

1936
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,440
>> the first time you see it,

1937
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,640
>> you play test a live action game that

1938
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,000
lasts two a month.

1939
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,360
>> Uh that actually came up in the forums.

1940
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I believe somebody was asking about

1941
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:43,840
this. Um you can at best play test given

1942
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,120
mechanics. Uh you can you can play test

1943
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,560
certain game mechanics and write down a

1944
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,480
stripped down version which takes out

1945
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,719
all of the plot motivations and just

1946
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,320
test say combat. This is our combat play

1947
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,480
uh play test. I did that for a matrix

1948
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,480
game once. You know it's like I'm

1949
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:59,600
writing a game about a matrix. Combat is

1950
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,679
really freaking important. Uh so I just

1951
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,000
made an entire game where all it was was

1952
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,760
you want you want to go in and get this

1953
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
thing and then get out. That's the whole

1954
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,159
rule. And here's your three pages of

1955
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,640
combat. And people like holy this

1956
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:17,040
is a lot of memory. Um but uh and that

1957
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,480
showed me the problems uh that I had.

1958
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,080
Unfortunately, it's not one of those. It

1959
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,520
didn't it wasn't so catastrophic that I

1960
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,239
would use it as a catastrophic game

1961
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,679
example. So

1962
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:27,199
>> tell us about catastrophic examples.

1963
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,920
>> Catastrophic game examples. Uh okay. I

1964
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,360
think

1965
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,920
>> someone tripped and hurt himself. That's

1966
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,920
what I'm not.

1967
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,400
>> No, no, no, no, no, no. That's that's

1968
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,239
that's uh that's that's that's not what

1969
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,560
you're looking for. I understand. It was

1970
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:41,199
a game where

1971
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,800
everyone was uh

1972
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,920
was was playing undead. I can't remember

1973
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,640
if they were vampire. I think they were

1974
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:50,159
vampires. So, they could get knocked

1975
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,760
down if they got shot uh and they will

1976
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,120
get up again in five minutes because

1977
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,719
they were immortal. Unless they got

1978
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,040
staked or something, they would get up

1979
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:59,199
again. Unfortunately, there were a lot

1980
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,000
of vampires in game. Often of them, many

1981
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,760
of them were on different factions. So,

1982
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,120
they were going after each other with

1983
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,199
guns. So when two people who were

1984
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:12,080
obviously against each other shot each

1985
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:16,520
other, fell over, they would get up in

1986
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,520
five minutes and shoot each other again

1987
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,480
repeatedly begging for someone to show

1988
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,360
up for a certain to come and do

1989
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,480
something to break this deadlock cuz and

1990
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,000
that's one of those things where it's

1991
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,560
like game mechanically you know what's

1992
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,719
supposed to happen but it sucks, you

1993
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,880
know, and

1994
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,520
and then was it really Right. So that's

1995
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,719
that's funny.

1996
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,679
>> We have to wait five minutes. Can we

1997
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,520
just do can we just continue like shoot?

1998
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,199
>> Well, but but that's the but the issue

1999
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,120
is again these games are happening in

2000
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:48,480
real time. So the five minute rule is

2001
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:51,679
there possibly for a reason you know uh

2002
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:53,120
uh while you are down for five minutes

2003
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,800
those five minutes may become very

2004
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,440
valuable for someone who wants you down

2005
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,600
for for those five minutes. So you know

2006
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,040
I you can't kill me I can't kill you but

2007
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,560
both of us can knock each other down for

2008
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,080
five minutes. That's a great delaying

2009
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,159
tactic. If I can send one of my friends

2010
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:09,360
and do something that I don't want you

2011
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:10,960
interfering with. Um, and if that's the

2012
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,400
case, then that's great. But often it

2013
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,520
was just that, oh crap, there's just no

2014
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,040
way to break the deadlock.

2015
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,280
>> You'd fear the the limiting factor of

2016
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,120
the ammunition, though.

2017
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:22,960
>> I think that game actually let you pick

2018
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:24,239
up your ammunition while you were

2019
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,320
>> because because it can be a really

2020
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:27,760
annoying limit limitation to run off to

2021
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,280
run off ammunition, especially if you're

2022
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,520
playing with the little rubber dart

2023
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,280
guns. uh cuz carrying a whole pile of

2024
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,520
them is really annoying. So if the if

2025
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,000
the rule is I can I get to pick them up

2026
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,440
then you you have the illusion of having

2027
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,480
a lot of ammunition without having to

2028
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,480
carry a lot of ammunition.

2029
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,159
Uh so that's one example of a

2030
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,080
catastrophic failure that there's a

2031
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:50,640
really funny quote regarding u

2032
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,640
brainwashing actually which is you know

2033
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,600
um

2034
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:58,480
who were know what where were you I was

2035
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,520
not being brainwashed. Who are you with?

2036
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,520
Not with the people who are

2037
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,880
brainwashing.

2038
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,480
This is exactly the problem with the

2039
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,800
persuasion thing, right? You know, it's

2040
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,320
like, you know, I I I want to tell you

2041
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,640
something because my goals haven't

2042
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,800
changed far uh far enough to want to

2043
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,320
align me to my new goals. So, I'm going

2044
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,679
to do everything that I can without

2045
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,600
breaking the rules. I'm not allowed to

2046
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,440
tell you that I was being brainwashed,

2047
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,440
right? So, I can say that I wasn't being

2048
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,440
brainwashed.

2049
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,600
Other catastrophic

2050
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,880
How long does the thing take? Probably

2051
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,920
>> I don't know.

2052
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,719
>> Probably about as long as

2053
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,360
half an hour.

2054
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,480
>> Yeah.

2055
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,040
>> Depends on the people.

2056
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,800
>> Well, if you put a time limit on like

2057
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,560
discussions then

2058
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,480
>> cuz I plan on a password where it's less

2059
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,760
hours just because there was no cap and

2060
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,159
people just went to these long

2061
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,520
discussions in between rounds.

2062
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,880
>> So if you put a cap like okay we're

2063
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,040
going to it's going to be this long

2064
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,199
discussion and then we're going to kill

2065
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,199
someone off. So something

2066
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:59,520
Let's see. I have one. Anybody here

2067
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,480
played online mafia? So totally

2068
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,920
different experience.

2069
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,040
>> Yeah, for sure.

2070
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,400
>> Pinball or something

2071
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,360
>> on forums usually.

2072
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,600
>> Oh,

2073
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,159
>> yeah. So anybody?

2074
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,640
>> Yeah.

2075
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:12,239
>> So basically when you can look at the

2076
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,679
history of what people have said and who

2077
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:17,040
they've accused and what order they did

2078
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,440
it in changes how mafia pans out, right?

2079
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,280
Mhm.

2080
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,360
>> Because all of a sudden people start

2081
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:24,080
going back and look at the history of

2082
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,840
compiling statistics of who says who and

2083
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,560
who said what and then who must be on

2084
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,400
their side if that's the case. But then

2085
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,800
there's this kind of meta knowledge that

2086
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:38,800
you can use of this if you're a mafia

2087
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:40,800
>> because you can kind of tell your m so

2088
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,719
in in our particular case with forums we

2089
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,199
were able to kind of communicate at the

2090
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:47,600
mafia privately. Mhm.

2091
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:49,120
>> Um, and that meant we could, for

2092
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,800
instance, do things like making sure

2093
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,320
that we were never the first people to

2094
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,400
accuse anyone.

2095
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,920
>> So, as a mafia, you should never do that

2096
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,560
because it immediately makes you look

2097
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:01,600
suspicious later on if somebody turns

2098
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,800
out to be or not be in the mafia.

2099
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,560
>> Like, there's no way that you can admit

2100
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,320
if you're the first person who accuses,

2101
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,679
but bandwagoning somebody who's not in

2102
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:11,440
the mafia is always great. So, so you

2103
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,679
can kind of coordinate to do this sort

2104
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,520
of thing and then like try and defeat

2105
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,400
the statistical analysis that somebody

2106
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,080
else is doing.

2107
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,440
>> You've got you've got this whole shadow

2108
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,920
governing feeling.

2109
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:25,840
>> Also, a great like tactic to get to draw

2110
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,000
get you away from being on team someone

2111
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,239
else is to execute someone on your team

2112
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,400
and hope that if they they don't

2113
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,920
actually like vote.

2114
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,960
that. Yeah. I mean, I've definitely been

2115
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,960
in a game where we purposely killed off

2116
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,920
one of the people on our team just so

2117
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,880
that we wouldn't be accused. I like,

2118
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,960
"Oh, you he cannot be on mafia because

2119
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:49,360
he killed off a mafia."

2120
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:52,560
>> Okay. He's And then we end up winning

2121
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:54,560
because no one no one figured that out.

2122
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,640
I I mean that's one of the best things

2123
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:59,199
about all kinds of live action games is

2124
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,440
that it almost encourages people to look

2125
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:03,280
for these kind of slightly out of the

2126
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,800
box illusions. These sort of emergent

2127
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,320
I'm not really going to expect that but

2128
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,840
still fits within the rules because

2129
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,000
you're dealing with real people for the

2130
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,199
most part. You're not you're not limited

2131
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,880
to the cards that you're allowed to play

2132
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:17,360
or the turns that that you're allowed to

2133
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:21,760
take. Uh so taking advantage of that. Um

2134
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:22,719
I I have one more disaster story. Uh

2135
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,920
>> I want to hear

2136
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:29,440
>> there is I I'll I'll limit it to just

2137
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:32,400
one for the people who don't. Um the the

2138
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:34,400
this is a game where there is a virus

2139
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,840
that was spreading.

2140
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,679
People who are in the assassin skill

2141
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,800
might have really heard of this one but

2142
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:45,199
um the whole basic idea is that there

2143
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:47,840
was a explosive nano virus. um people

2144
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:51,199
who got infected after a certain amount

2145
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:54,960
of time will explode and anybody in the

2146
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:56,719
room with them will now be infected. Um

2147
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,800
of course this was a game, you know,

2148
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,480
this is kind of a game in set in science

2149
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,040
fiction kind of thing and they've got

2150
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,440
doctors who are capable who have

2151
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:08,320
mechanics to be able to research cures.

2152
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:11,199
Um however when the doctor happens to be

2153
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:14,560
one of the first people to die

2154
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:17,520
game um what rapidly happens is that

2155
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,280
what should have been a one night game

2156
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,679
turned out to be a one-hour game when

2157
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,679
everybody exploded.

2158
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:30,640
So you know um I guess that might come

2159
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:32,800
down to feasibility but that that I mean

2160
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,560
you can think about it as as a you need

2161
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,239
a certain amount of redundancy when

2162
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,640
you're coming when you're designing any

2163
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:41,760
game but particularly live action games

2164
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:44,239
because happens. Um and you've got

2165
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,000
to expect that to happen. You there's

2166
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,520
always this fear about oh I put in too

2167
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,040
many resources into this game then the

2168
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,120
players are going to find it too easy.

2169
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,400
And it's most more often than not, yeah,

2170
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,800
there are some players that are going to

2171
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,120
say, "We breeze through that." But

2172
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,400
rarely do people get terribly upset in a

2173
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,880
live action game when something is

2174
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:03,440
slightly too easy. Um, they get really

2175
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,760
upset when it becomes when it's even

2176
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,159
near possible. you know, it's like, oh,

2177
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,880
so the GMs only made it possible for

2178
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:12,800
only made one made it possible for one

2179
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,640
person to fix this problem and that

2180
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,600
person and they didn't think about that

2181
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,840
person just dying in the beginning of

2182
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,400
So yeah, that was that was another

2183
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,480
example. None of which were my my games.

2184
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,800
I'm sorry. I feel really bad about bring

2185
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,719
not bringing examples for my games, but

2186
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:32,480
I don't know which ones were the ones

2187
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:35,360
that I generally Oh, I do have one more.

2188
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,880
So, this was after The Sims came out and

2189
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,440
and people should already be worried

2190
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,199
about that. Um, I I I thought having a

2191
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,719
blatant stat would be a really good idea

2192
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,760
for a game. This was a game that was set

2193
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,040
on a train.

2194
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,480
>> Oh,

2195
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,400
>> this was this was a game that was set in

2196
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,159
a train. It was steampunk. So, tea was a

2197
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:53,040
game. I think tea was in fact a combat

2198
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:54,880
drug. Um, if you drank tea, your combat

2199
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,760
stats will increase, but so would your

2200
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,840
bladder stat. every once your bladder

2201
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,080
stat was past a certain point uh all the

2202
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:05,199
combat stats went down and you really

2203
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:07,520
had to get to the restroom. Um which was

2204
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:10,080
really interesting.

2205
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,719
Most people just reviled that that game

2206
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:10,719
back me back me back me back me back me

2207
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,639
back me back me back me back me back me

2208
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:15,920
back because it was one more number they

2209
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:18,880
had to hit cold in their head that was

2210
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,320
stupid annoying and really didn't do

2211
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,000
terribly much for the immersion of the

2212
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,159
game. You know, I I was thinking, oh,

2213
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,360
it's a game about traveling on a train.

2214
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:26,639
So, you use the restroom all the time.

2215
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,040
That's the only thing I do when I'm

2216
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:32,960
traveling. I use the restroom. It's the

2217
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:34,880
most momentous event. Um, but um but

2218
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,800
then that even that led to some

2219
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,880
interesting emergent situations because

2220
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,719
when this train gets attacked and

2221
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,639
everybody needs to find a safe place to

2222
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,560
hide, what they all do is they get into

2223
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:46,800
the washroom,

2224
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,280
barricade it, and drink tea until all

2225
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,920
the combat stats go up the roof and then

2226
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,120
win the fight. Um because we were right

2227
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,120
there in the restroom, we could afford

2228
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:58,520
to do that.

2229
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,520
>> It was hilarious.

2230
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:03,840
>> These people come up with exploits and

2231
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,360
>> that's fun.

2232
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,719
>> They may hate the rules, but once they

2233
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,480
understand how the systems work, they're

2234
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,840
going to come up with ways to to to use

2235
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,960
it to their advantage. And that can be

2236
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:14,880
some of the most enjoyable.

2237
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:19,280
>> I saw a squirrel this past weekend and

2238
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,679
figured out it stood under a bird feed.

2239
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,320
um

2240
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:22,560
>> ah

2241
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,760
>> thing that was spending the tree

2242
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,679
>> it could just get pre-cluded because

2243
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,120
when the birds ate it once every two

2244
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,080
three minutes they would drop a grain

2245
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,000
accidentally

2246
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,480
>> and and there was this really fat

2247
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,040
squirrel in it just sitting there and

2248
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,080
spent the entire day just sitting under

2249
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,920
you know

2250
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,040
>> so I mean like it's so natural to just

2251
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,239
try to find exploits everything and

2252
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,440
>> there is there is a moral

2253
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,480
>> like it doesn't work for immersion but

2254
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,480
you still do it anyway

2255
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,080
>> there is a moral to that though is that

2256
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,920
for live action games especially if

2257
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:53,360
you're playing a live action game

2258
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,920
community. Uh there is whatever you

2259
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,440
write down as a rule, you may put it up

2260
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,520
on the wall, you may put it in a piece

2261
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:03,679
of paper, someone's going to try to do

2262
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,040
it. And uh and you you have to think of

2263
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,280
I'm going to put in a rule that's so

2264
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,600
ridiculous that that people are not

2265
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,880
going to want to try to do it uh because

2266
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,199
it's going to hurt them. Something like

2267
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,280
jump on this jump jump on the spot 100

2268
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:16,800
times and you unlock this door. Or you

2269
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,080
could find someone with lock with

2270
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,600
lockpicking, you know, and you would

2271
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:21,040
just assume that person's going to find

2272
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,639
someone with lockpicking. No, someone's

2273
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:24,800
going to jump on the spot 100 times and

2274
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,920
they're gonna hate you for it because

2275
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:31,360
you put a rule in there for it. So, um,

2276
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,880
you know, try not to hurt your players.

2277
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,199
It'll be tomorrow, you know, because

2278
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,679
they will do what you tell them to do.

2279
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:41,840
>> Disclosure form.

2280
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:44,239
>> All right, that's uh cards. Um so um

2281
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,000
before we go I want to like clarify the

2282
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:49,120
in this version the um investigation

2283
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,679
mechanic. So the group gets to the group

2284
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:54,000
of scientists gets to test two people.

2285
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:57,199
Um if you catch the thing then they're

2286
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,639
dead and out. If you if you catch them

2287
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,920
on the second time, this is what I've

2288
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:03,520
read. If you catch them on the second

2289
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,960
guess, you get another guess. Um I'm not

2290
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,719
sure if that means you can have infinite

2291
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,080
guesses or not. So that's something to

2292
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,840
play around. If you test your wrong

2293
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,880
person is not a thing, they don't die.

2294
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,320
>> No. Okay.

2295
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,600
>> So, I test someone the first time

2296
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,560
they're a thing, then they're out. But I

2297
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,960
have someone a second time.

2298
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,239
>> Yeah.

2299
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,360
>> Regardless of whether or not I've tested

2300
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:21,280
a thing the first time.

2301
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,560
>> Yes.

2302
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,840
>> At least two guesses.

2303
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,600
>> But if you test someone on the second

2304
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,120
one, they don't die.

2305
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,480
>> If they're the thing, they're dead.

2306
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,159
>> Thing dies. But if you test someone on

2307
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,360
the first time and they're the thing,

2308
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,159
you don't get an extra guess.

2309
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,360
>> Well, not necessarily.

2310
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,840
>> No, you get you get two.

2311
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,000
>> You always get two of these two. So you

2312
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:40,320
have if you guess anytime I'm saying if

2313
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,800
you get a thing only one person a knife.

2314
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,239
>> Yeah.

2315
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,960
>> But if you guess a thing and then not a

2316
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,800
thing and you get a thing.

2317
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,560
>> Yeah. Like you can catch the thing.

2318
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,719
>> Yeah. I think you can catch the thing

2319
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,400
without actually doing anything other

2320
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,400
than like making a system where you

2321
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,719
automatically catch the thing

2322
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:56,960
>> and you're getting two guesses. So the

2323
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:59,520
ratio of like by randomly guessing

2324
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,960
you'll certainly change it, right? I

2325
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,639
mean this is just what I found and it

2326
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,920
seemed like an interesting way. part of

2327
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,440
the point, right?

2328
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,760
>> Which which which means do you start

2329
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,360
with?

2330
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,840
>> No, you're not perfectly because you

2331
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,159
could then

2332
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,159
>> as I recogn

2333
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:20,239
like

2334
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:22,880
bias towards the nonffected

2335
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,880
Appreciate something.
