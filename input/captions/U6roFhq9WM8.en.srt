1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,680
so uh Richards please take over and tell

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,960
us a story of the

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,720
journey well thank you

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,760
vadir um nice to meet everybody nice uh

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,039
nice to be back again uh four years

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,560
later for Nano Explorations um uh

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,879
Vladimir is correct I'm no longer at MIT

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,120
so I gave my talk in 2020 I graduated in

9
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,360
2021 uh and have been with active

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,480
surfaces now uh for about two years so

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,520
my current

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,239
role uh is in being uh one of the

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
operational co-founders and chief

14
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:53,160
technology officer my co-founder shiv

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,879
bakta is also an MIT grad uh in the

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,559
MBA uh MS program he comes from us doe

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,039
Department of energy both of us have

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,720
some VC experiment

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,200
background um just maybe a month ago or

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,400
so we closed a preed round uh so we're

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,720
very early stage company we're at about

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,200
eight people now full-time 15 if you

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,799
include uh all of our part-time staff

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,880
and we're really excited about kind of

25
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,640
what the future holds uh with us uh and

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,400
our

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,159
growth publicly we're known pretty much

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,520
as a Solar Company that's what I gave my

29
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,640
talk on in 2020 uh but but the reality

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,439
is is that we're actually a printed

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,360
electronics company uh we do a few

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,720
different things that uh have come out

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,799
of MIT most notably uh the thin film

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,799
flexible solar cells that have hit MIT

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,560
news but also uh some PE electric and Ms

36
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,280
work uh that we do mostly in

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,880
Partnerships with other companies uh now

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,680
why is this uh the reality is just like

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,159
PVD cvd and other things that kind of

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,560
the MIT Nano Community would be working

41
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,079
on uh printed electronics are also a

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,600
plat form technology uh so if you can

43
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,920
dissolve it in an ink and you can put it

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
into kind of a slot die head uh you can

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,560
print different materials and

46
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,560
semiconductor systems and ultimately

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,640
provide value for different sort of end

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,760
use

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,480
cases uh but we mostly work on energy

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,560
today uh and so I'll give a little bit

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,680
of background and kind of like

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,080
why uh solar of course everybody sort of

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,840
knows this but uh We've installed a lot

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,560
it's a relatively uh large Market

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,959
operationally since it's kind of

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,599
beginning of growth uh in the 50s in the

57
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,840
Space Race uh Humanity has collectively

58
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,480
installed about a terawatt uh in terms

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,000
of 2023 uh but to fully decarbonize we

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,920
need about 20 terawatts uh and that's

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,920
just a low uh a low capacity projection

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,519
the reality is probably it will need to

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,239
be closer to 30 to 50 terawatts uh to

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,760
account for things like

65
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,239
electrification uh and other

66
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,599
directionalities um

67
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,480
that's a lot of solar and that's a lot

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,360
of land most of the time we kind of put

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,799
these in

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,560
fields um but the better way to do it is

71
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,519
to put it in places where we've already

72
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,000
built um The Challenge though is that

73
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,920
it's very expensive it's about $3 a watt

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,599
to put solar on a rooftop only about 10%

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,680
of that ends up being the actual

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,599
Electronics uh and the rest of it is

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,720
really just installation and structural

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,840
labor and it's all really kind of uh pin

79
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,200
held by silicon which is the core

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,840
technology in about 98% of the market

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,959
today uh it's really heavy uh and

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,159
because of kind of its brittle nature uh

83
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,599
as a uh as a wafer ceramic it has to be

84
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,599
encased in at least three three mimers

85
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,480
of glass uh surrounded by aluminum to

86
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,280
prevent damage this makes each

87
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,000
individual panel about 60 pounds you put

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,599
this on a building that's a lot of

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,040
weight um with the form factor sizes and

90
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,159
kind of the limitations of uh 4inch

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,239
Wafers which is what solar started on

92
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,400
and then going to six-inch wafers

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,519
uh form factors have not changed uh

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,040
meaning that labor teams uh and

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,079
deployment is

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,519
unoptimized uh and the reality is this

97
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,720
kind of limits where you can put them

98
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,439
and again we mostly put these in

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,239
fields um in the commercial Market which

100
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,600
is where we as a company kind of pursue

101
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,000
only about 3% of rooftops actually have

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,040
solar um but the reality is due to these

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
constraints only about 30% of buildings

104
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,759
can actually be

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,720
accessed uh and this limitation is not

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,199
not a theoretical number it's actually

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,720
being hit in places like Japan and

108
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,560
Singapore which do have kind of maxed

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,199
out penetrations around the 30% Mark uh

110
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,199
in the us alone this leaves about 20 gws

111
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,680
of

112
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,919
opportunity uh just on commercial

113
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,560
buildings so that's not even like

114
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,160
households that's not even uh you know

115
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,960
all the solar we would ever need and our

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,039
approach is really to kind of uh solve

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,000
this problem with something that's

118
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,039
lightweight integratable Deployable and

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,160
much easier to

120
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,280
installed um but my talk is not on the

121
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
technology of active surfaces today and

122
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,440
kind of what we're pursuing but kind of

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,840
uh where I started so my talk about four

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,240
years ago was on manufacturing large

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,960
area prop skites um and I'm not going to

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,080
go through the whole talk uh it was

127
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,319
midway through my uh

128
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,880
PhD uh but just give a little background

129
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,120
prets are these really

130
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,560
interesting uh absorbers uh for the

131
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,960
solar Market uh they're very interesting

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,520
Material Science compounds lots of

133
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,160
opportunity in terms of different things

134
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,960
you can discover uh but my work at M was

135
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
all on around the hidden challenges of

136
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,400
manufacturing so toxicity that goes into

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,199
kind of printing these things how we go

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,600
and make new ink systems that can

139
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,120
actually deploy these at relatively

140
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,039
cost-efficient ways uh and then some of

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,919
the other hidden things that need to go

142
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:04,199
into final uh module manufacturing like

143
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,240
EPA limitations around uh toxicity and

144
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,759
the use of lead and kind of the work

145
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,560
that we were doing solving

146
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,599
it um active surfaces uh did spin out of

147
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,360
this and I could tell kind of the whole

148
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:20,960
story but it's very long uh the real I

149
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,560
gave the talk in 2020 um I ended up

150
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,319
giving my defense also over

151
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,000
Zoom uh on kind of the final results of

152
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,520
what this accomplished which was really

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,759
kind of high production speeds and high

154
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,400
efficiencies in the range of like

155
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,560
20% uh I did that mid

156
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,919
2021 active surfaces was founded July

157
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
11th

158
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,960
2022 I would meet shiv my

159
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,400
co-founder uh just a few months after

160
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,360
that uh in the fall semester of 2020

161
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,400
uh3 and then we'd go on and start uh

162
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,000
actually generating kind of the

163
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,400
motivation that most people see us

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,879
publicly we first uh our first public

165
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,000
pitch competition was the Harvard

166
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,000
climate Symposium that same year uh shiv

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,160
pitched at the MIT 100K pitch uh and

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,639
then that really propelled us into to

169
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,840
real spinning out of MIT uh which for us

170
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,560
started at Greentown Labs uh and I'm

171
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,039
currently sitting in our new office in

172
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,960
wubber

173
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,360
Massachusetts through that timeline

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
we've gone through pretty much three

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,960
eras uh

176
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,280
formation uh where it was really just me

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
and I was trying to paper the company

178
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,080
and find a

179
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,800
direction uh to meet eating shiv going

180
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,039
from two people and then eventually to

181
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,879
our first two

182
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,000
interns uh where we're trying to

183
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,440
generate excitement toine ourselves

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
Define what the company was going to

185
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,159
establish Define what we were going to

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,159
try to pursue uh and then to today uh

187
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,639
having closed the preed of around five

188
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,400
and a half million growing out the team

189
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,440
building our new lab space uh and really

190
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,199
trying to get to something

191
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,000
commercial uh and so I thought an

192
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,360
interesting and fun thing to do is to

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,840
actually tell three stories from these

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,759
three stages of active surfaces and kind

195
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,240
of my takeaways and

196
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,560
Reflections so the first one which is

197
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,680
not that fun of a story uh but one

198
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,120
that's interesting

199
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,720
nonetheless in the very early days uh I

200
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,560
got kicked out of iore and then got

201
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,080
immediately backstabbed by a friend and

202
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,800
so context here is relatively important

203
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,599
um uh again it was just me in the

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,640
company I had graduated at this time uh

205
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,800
I came off of an intership in VC uh and

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,440
we had kind of this uh early inkling

207
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,599
that there was something interesting

208
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,279
with regards to my PhD work and others

209
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,880
uh to kind of form it into a startup and

210
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,760
pursue something valuable but uh in the

211
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,680
Deep Tech world it's really hard to know

212
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,640
exactly where you need to go

213
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,360
commercially and so a lot of those early

214
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,080
questions were kind of where to start

215
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,800
how to start what do we pursue and why

216
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,800
um and so I was trying to find uh the

217
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,120
direction for the company at that point

218
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,800
we were called the

219
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,480
year uh which I think is a funny story I

220
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,120
did the engine blueprints program and

221
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,399
then the nsfi core uh right after that

222
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,600
uh and at the same time because it was

223
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,480
just me it was a lot of uh burden in

224
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,079
terms of the work in terms of spinning

225
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,160
out what the company was actually going

226
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,000
to be and really papering

227
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,720
everything um so a lot of things were

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,480
going on nothing was really solidified

229
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,480
and what ended up happening

230
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,200
is uh I did iore largely because at the

231
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,760
time we thought Acoustics was more

232
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,040
interesting to start with

233
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,680
first um and if you've ever done iore

234
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,040
you know that it's an interview uh

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
numbers game so you have about three

236
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,600
weeks you know I think you have to hit

237
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
something like 50 interviews on customer

238
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,760
Discovery you report back they critique

239
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,160
you on kind of how well you did um about

240
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,959
two weeks in it was clear I wasn't going

241
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,160
to hit it uh I know now that the

242
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,079
Acoustics Market is very Consolidated

243
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,040
and the amount of people that I can

244
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:11,000
actually approach is not very big um and

245
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,839
my mentor in iore program after those

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,480
two weeks said you're not putting in

247
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,279
enough effort you're clearly not

248
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,560
interested and you should just drop out

249
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,640
figure out what you want to do and then

250
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,040
maybe do this

251
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,040
later that hurt at the same

252
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,000
time I was introduced to a friend who

253
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,720
had a

254
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,440
friend uh and a small team interested in

255
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,920
kind of joining early stage startup they

256
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,920
were part of the MIT Network and I was

257
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,920
kind of doing the founder matching you

258
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,720
know uh dating aspect to try to uh

259
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,959
reduce some of this burden that I was

260
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,399
really stressed out about uh trying to

261
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,959
find where to go and what to do now

262
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,959
ultimately it didn't work

263
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,880
out um I think they had different

264
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,560
mindsets about what active surfaces

265
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,360
should have been ramp up timelines were

266
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,200
aggressive for my taste and what I

267
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,680
thought was accomplishable with a new

268
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,720
semiconductor based Tech technology and

269
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,240
it was clear they didn't really value

270
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,560
engineering uh and wanted to place a

271
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,440
high focus on Business Development which

272
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,959
also I didn't really like so I told them

273
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,680
that we needed to go our separate ways

274
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,519
I'd find out something else to do or do

275
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,839
this on my own as a soul founder uh and

276
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,120
that group ended up forming a separate

277
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,600
company within a few days and attempted

278
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,200
to license uh the MIT patents out from

279
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,720
under me in order to pursue something

280
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,720
without me involved and I like the story

281
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,839
because that is why active Services is

282
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,519
founded on July 11th um it wasn't this

283
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,560
culmination of people it wasn't this uh

284
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,920
culmination of ideas there's nothing you

285
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,680
know uh Bountiful about it uh active

286
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,480
surfaces got founded July 11th uh and

287
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,839
has the name active surfaces because it

288
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,680
was the least aggressive name it was

289
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,320
free with Delaware C uh filings and we

290
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,120
needed a company fast to start trying to

291
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,360
uh not have the license ripped out away

292
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,320
from

293
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,839
us now ultimately uh this got solved

294
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,720
very quickly uh at the time it was

295
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,760
horrible uh I felt like the company was

296
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,720
going to die before it even

297
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,959
started uh but you have to remember

298
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,880
about a month later I met shiv uh and

299
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,480
about three months after that uh we

300
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,240
started winning our prize

301
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,480
monies uh and so the company is still

302
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,639
fine again we're we're up at 10 people

303
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,880
now uh but my takeaways

304
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:38,680
here uh kind of in these early days uh

305
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,839
that I share with you is that uh with

306
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,320
regards to iore and kind of this idea

307
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,639
around customer

308
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Discovery most startup programs kind of

309
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,839
lean on uh a method Top by Steve blank

310
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,279
Stanford uh which is kind of the lean uh

311
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,440
startup model uh in and around Agile

312
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,279
development uh and it's really good you

313
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,320
know it works for many many startups it

314
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,720
works for for getting sort of that early

315
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,839
sort of business Direction uh it is

316
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,279
adopted by just about every program so

317
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,600
it's adopted by NSF iore theb the engine

318
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,959
blueprints program does it too anytime

319
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,760
you see a program that gives you a

320
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,959
business model canvas it almost

321
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,680
certainly originated uh from Steve

322
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,839
blank

323
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,639
um lean startups rely on Direct Customer

324
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,800
interviews that's the first thing you do

325
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,320
you start asking about value uh try to

326
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,079
get value of the thing that you'd

327
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,440
eventually sell

328
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,560
um with deep Tech the thing I've learned

329
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,920
going through this now four years in is

330
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,560
that this is actually the wrong question

331
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,360
um you should not be this early on

332
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,959
asking customers for feedback on a thing

333
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,160
that doesn't exist you should be asking

334
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,120
if this thing does exist how does it

335
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,680
change consumer Behavior now of course

336
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,560
that still relies on on knowing the

337
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,680
market and talking to people but asking

338
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,839
what their actual value is to pay is is

339
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,079
kind of

340
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,639
useless uh and similarly in those early

341
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,040
days especially when I was looking for a

342
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,519
co-founder I was asking the wrong

343
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,040
question I was asking for someone to

344
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,959
spread the workload with me I was

345
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,199
looking for operators people who who

346
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,199
knew things like I didn't like

347
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,320
taxes or uh how to assess uh different

348
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,839
sort of top- down Market

349
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,079
models uh and that was wrong because I

350
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
shouldn't have been searching for

351
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,920
someone to take the load off me I should

352
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,120
have been asking who can I rely on to

353
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,199
push the vision forward

354
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,240
and ultimately that ended up being the

355
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:38,079
more successful way to find a co-founder

356
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,680
um again I met shiv and we've done great

357
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,759
together uh since

358
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,000
then second thing I want to share with

359
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,800
you is that uh and again if you know us

360
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,120
we we ended up winning MIT 100K in

361
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,240
2023 uh but we bombed at the rice

362
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,680
business plan

363
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,079
competition uh one day

364
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,399
before uh so set the scene again uh

365
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:04,680
we're now two people in the company uh

366
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,800
we're in a phase where we're established

367
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,480
we're

368
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,199
papered and we're trying to figure out

369
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,079
uh and generate a lot of excitement

370
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,480
around the motivation and the idea you

371
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,000
know um this was actually shiv's idea

372
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,320
this was not mine so I gave him all the

373
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,720
credit uh and ultimately he was right is

374
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,079
to sort of uh Market yourselves and

375
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,360
Market the team as early as

376
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,319
possible um so we were trying to build

377
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,880
this momentum uh we were applying to

378
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,199
just about everything we could um but we

379
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,680
couldn't actually do anything

380
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,720
operationally we had no money uh I was

381
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,480
not taking a salary at the time shiv was

382
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,480
still in school uh and we're doing all

383
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,839
this to kind of find investors and gain

384
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,839
some

385
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,839
traction

386
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,519
uh so what ended up

387
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,560
happening so success is objective uh I

388
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,160
guess we did officially win something

389
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,040
although it was a minor prize uh it was

390
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,040
on the uh sustainable investment prize

391
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,360
um the reality is that the major prizes

392
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,800
were in multi-millions of dollars I

393
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,279
think upwards of like three to four

394
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,079
million were actually given out uh at

395
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,399
this

396
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:21,759
competition uh everybody who won was a

397
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,959
SAS company or a fintech

398
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,079
company uh and this was a big letdown

399
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:30,600
for us because Houston uh the center of

400
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:32,600
oil is known as the city of energy uh

401
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,639
and we thought that being an energy

402
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,639
based kind of play uh with regards to

403
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,440
our our commercial direction would

404
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,399
actually resonate here uh and it didn't

405
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,319
the the judges were extremely judgmental

406
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,360
about our uh timelines to development uh

407
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:50,759
or technology Readiness levels uh they

408
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,959
were mostly Angel groups uh who wanted

409
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,680
to give out kind of small money and get

410
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,720
really high returns uh and it was just a

411
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,800
really big letdown at the end of the day

412
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,639
um

413
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:06,319
um right after that uh right after that

414
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,480
that photo was taken we spent 12 hours

415
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,559
in the Houston Airport uh on a delayed

416
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,240
flight uh we got into Boston I think

417
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,360
like 2 am uh I live up here in saem

418
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,160
Massachusetts so I didn't get home till

419
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,679
3:00

420
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:24,079
a.m. uh and the MIT 100K I think I we

421
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,760
had to be there like 11 or 12 something

422
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,400
like that for uh pre-practice before the

423
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,720
event actually started now the result of

424
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,880
this is that we actually won uh we s

425
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,200
house we had both the audience award uh

426
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,360
and won the full thing uh very proud of

427
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,360
that I think it was a very key milestone

428
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,679
in our

429
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,120
development uh but a big takeaway here

430
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,080
for me uh as I move

431
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,760
forward is

432
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,440
that in the early stages of being a

433
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,200
startup you have lots and lots of ups

434
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,840
and downs um it can get very mentally

435
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,280
exhausting one week you're on a high the

436
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,799
next week you think the company's going

437
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,960
to go under and it's this cyclic you

438
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,799
know rise and fall where you don't

439
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,000
really know where you're going to land

440
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,280
and it takes a lot of mental

441
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,159
perseverance uh something I still kind

442
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,280
of remind myself of that

443
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,600
like if things are bad today they will

444
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,480
be better tomorrow and I shouldn't get

445
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,640
myself down but a quote that I really

446
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,159
resonate with uh through this is that

447
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,760
even if the company does poorly uh my

448
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,840
career will actually be fine uh the

449
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,799
path of going through this is more

450
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,440
important uh than the overall outcome in

451
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,120
terms of the entire

452
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,799
industry um now through this again we

453
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,440
were successful uh that Rice business

454
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:48,280
plan was kind of a lull and an otherwise

455
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,960
relatively successful year for us uh we

456
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,760
operated out of Greentown Labs we

457
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,200
actually still do to a minor extent uh

458
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,080
did relatively well at clean teac openen

459
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,240
uh and we're part of a number of uh

460
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,640
smaller like Excel the Swiss next

461
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,840
climate collider Venture for climate

462
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,400
Tech and now we're still in third

463
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,919
derivative ET program uh so overall we

464
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,440
did really well uh and I'm ultimately

465
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:17,799
really proud of where uh we came through

466
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,600
on that year um getting to the growth

467
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:24,039
stage um and this is kind of more just a

468
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,600
funny story for me um which we're still

469
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,600
in by the way uh we we closed our

470
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,360
financing earlier this year uh we've

471
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,960
been building building building ever

472
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,480
since we're actually still hiring um so

473
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,840
I'm just going to make that as my first

474
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,320
plug of that um this was our lab about

475
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,080
two months ago uh I think that one week

476
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,760
we had the first of many shipments come

477
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:53,000
in and the the whole thing looked like a

478
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,480
mess um and the reality is that uh some

479
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,400
of the things again the compressed dryer

480
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:02,640
system has been one of the biggest pains

481
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,799
in my ass for about six months now um

482
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,919
we're a chemistry company uh Material

483
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,000
Science company um manufacturing company

484
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
however you want to describe it

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,799
[Music]

486
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,559
um and it was clear to us very very

487
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,520
early on that we needed nitrogen and

488
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:24,559
clean dry air uh in order to support our

489
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,159
entire kind of tool set um we started

490
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,000
this even before we closed financing I'm

491
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,640
kind of specking this out uh nitrogen is

492
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,559
relatively easy to install if you ever

493
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,200
have to do it um you mostly just go to

494
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,039
air gas and get permitting uh it takes a

495
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,039
long period of time to do that uh but

496
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,200
for us the clean dry air was actually

497
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,760
unique uh we spec it out pretty

498
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,000
differently to how most people

499
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,919
would uh they have very specific

500
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,240
requirements and and I would consider a

501
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,280
non-standard

502
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,520
installation uh kind of due to our

503
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,480
specific

504
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,760
needs um and installing it has been an

505
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,720
absolute nightmare

506
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,039
it took about two months to pick it out

507
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,120
I think I rotated through like three or

508
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,880
four

509
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,400
Consultants uh trying to to estimate

510
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,880
what what we needed and why and and sort

511
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,240
of pick out something despite the fact

512
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,080
that we didn't have a good idea of

513
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,760
everything we'd eventually

514
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,919
build um when you're an early stage

515
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,000
startup and you don't have credit

516
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,159
ordering something of that size can be a

517
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,679
hassle too uh so we ordered it had to

518
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,039
prepay for everything uh even though

519
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,600
delivery and timelines I think took

520
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,600
about two and a half

521
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,960
months uh when we finally got it uh we

522
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,360
moved it in and wired it uh we don't

523
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,159
have a loading dock so that was a hassle

524
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,799
uh and one of the legs actually got

525
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:47,080
damaged kind of in

526
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,720
transit our initial electrician wired it

527
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,720
wrong uh then our machine installer who

528
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,000
was supposed to Plum it into our CDA

529
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,919
line plumbed it wrong uh then went back

530
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,279
and rewired it wrong and it's been this

531
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,159
kind of cylic cylic issue uh and the

532
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,000
last fun thing is that even when it got

533
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,480
in and it was finally plumbed right and

534
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,360
finally wired right now it overheats uh

535
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,520
based on where it is and so we need to

536
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,559
install kind of direct exhaust to this

537
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,640
machine and it's safe to say that my

538
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,880
entire team probably all 15 of us at

539
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,559
some point has put time and effort into

540
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,760
contributing some way that this uh

541
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:31,120
compressor gets in uh to our lab now I

542
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,159
think it's relevant uh in this story to

543
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,480
give kind of a brief history of

544
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,520
compressed dry air uh compressed air was

545
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,640
first used industrial settings in the

546
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,720
1820s uh the first portable ones uh were

547
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,440
used in uh

548
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,520
1857 uh kind of that photo there shows

549
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,080
what they what they look like uh they

550
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,640
actually predate Electric Tools um so

551
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,799
their first kind of industrial uh hand

552
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,720
tools used in industry uh and today

553
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,799
clean dry a is sometimes refer as the

554
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,679
fourth utility

555
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:05,960
so you'd think this would be easy it was

556
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
not and my takeaway to this is that

557
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,880
building something unique and different

558
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,480
even if it's a non-standard installation

559
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,520
of a compressor takes a lot of

560
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,159
time and the things that can take the

561
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,039
longest are not necessarily the most

562
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:23,640
exciting it's not us sitting down and

563
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,200
building solar cells or building them as

564
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,480
devices for us that's actually kind of

565
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,080
easy it's it's these kind of

566
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,520
non-standard things where we rely on

567
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,559
others that take the longest and the

568
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,279
reality is that the quality of people

569
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,880
that you surround yourself with how

570
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,360
willing they are to actually solve this

571
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
problem and roll up their sleeves how

572
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,520
much they actually believe in what the

573
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,960
Company's trying to to really pursue and

574
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,320
build are the Absol most important

575
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,640
things to success and I'm really glad

576
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,440
that we surrounded ourselves with the

577
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,320
right people uh because otherwise this

578
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,520
compressor would never have gone

579
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:00,000
in so in summary uh to kind of conclude

580
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,679
my talk um and sort of sum it up into

581
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,799
three bullet points from when I first

582
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,159
presented in 2020 to

583
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:10,640
now um building things requires a few

584
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,279
different key things but first and

585
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,279
foremost you need to ask the right

586
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:17,559
questions about what you're building and

587
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,120
why you need to believe in yourself on

588
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,400
how to actually do it and you need to

589
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,760
find people and surround them who will

590
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,919
do the

591
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,559
same and my last plug on this we're

592
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,880
still hiring so if you know material

593
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,640

that uh I'd like to hand it back to

598
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,799
Vladimir uh and take any questions that

599
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,799
were sent through the talk to the

600
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,159
crowd Richard uh thank you very very

601
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,240
much uh it is awesome to hear the

602
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,679
journey and I have seen many of those

603
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,720
ups and downs uh as you indeed

604
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,240
progressed from one stage to the next uh

605
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,600
your perseverance is remarkable and it's

606
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm glad it yielded uh the active

607
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,840
surfaces where it is right now U if you

608
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,320
have questions for Richard there are

609
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,120
really three ways that uh you can indeed

610
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,240
submit them one of them is the Q&A

611
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,679
button uh that you see on the bottom of

612
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,320
the screen the another version would be

613
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:26,720
by sending it through a chat or lastly

614
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,880
simply raise your hand and uh we'll

615
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,559
recognize and call upon you

616
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,039
and uh we can then have you ask the

617
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,200
question verbally to Richard uh so let

618
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,760
me open the floor for any questions that

619
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:46,080
uh might be uh of

620
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:49,600
interest um I see uh jerson um paralta

623
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,640
question J

for the the talk it is amazing and

628
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,320
inspiring actually um I would like to

629
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,399
know one of the things I wonder every

630
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,279
time I think about uh starting myself

631
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:24,799
with a company is

632
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,840
um which kind of investment did you have

633
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,039
did you have at the beginning at the

634
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:33,799
early ear times and how you how did you

635
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:37,399
face that time that it was probably a

636
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:39,960
little bit with a high uncertainty un

637
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:43,960
unability from your

638
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,520
side yeah um that's a good question I I

639
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,080
I'll answer in two ways I'll directly

640
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,559
answer you uh so

641
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,279
the uh earliest money that we got in was

642
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,320
Venture Capital um so we pretty much

643
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,760
immediately went as a company to venture

644
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,279
capital um that being being said that's

645
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,000
not a very common route uh I would say

646
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,120
everybody's journey is different and my

647
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,960
advice is

648
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,880
usually um to look at your own industry

649
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,039
and see kind of

650
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,080
how uh how people are progressing uh

651
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:20,440
with that

652
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,440
um uh yeah there's lots of reasons why

653
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,960
we went to VC first um I don't know if I

654
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,640
have time to really list them all um I

655
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,200
think the reality though is like like

656
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,679
there is always going to be that early

657
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,279
point where it's just going to be you

658
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,520
kind of self financing it pulling

659
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,840
pushing it Forward uh for me that lasted

660
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,000
about six months uh before we kind of

661
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,039
finally got our first money in some of

662
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,760
it Grant winnings and Pitch competitions

663
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:46,799
and then uh like I said the first first

664
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,559
first money in is actually venture

665
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,559
capital in a very very

666
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,919
small Safe

667
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:58,240
Note uh couple of questions maybe to

668
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,720
continue on that uh from the Q&A um what

669
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,720
would you have done differently to

670
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,760
better facilitate investment more

671
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,640
quickly and added to that uh do you

672
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,559
still feel that the VC Community is

673
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,559
biased against

674
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,559
hardtech um these are good questions uh

675
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,880
I feel like I could spend all day on

676
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:25,799
them

677
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,799
um I think uh I mean looking back on it

678
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,039
um I wish I wish we didn't spend so much

679
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,440
time with investors we knew were the

680
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,840
wrong fit

681
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,480
um I think it wasted a decent chunk of

682
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,559
time I think we would have been a little

683
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,480
bit

684
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:49,880
earlier uh to kind of where we are now

685
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,039
um you know when when you do so like I I

686
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,600
talked kind of about like founder

687
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,960
matching in this talk with the reality

688
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,320
is you need to do it too with with

689
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,760
Venture Capital like putting the right

690
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,080
people around you is incredibly

691
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,600
important

692
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,559
um we've been very lucky where we've had

693
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,960
you know not only the right people uh

694
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:11,679
but we kind of got the choice of it not

695
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,440
everybody really has that

696
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,000
um but yeah there there was a lot of

697
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,399
times I think we we kind of were in the

698
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,679
VC like looking around the VC market and

699
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,240
I think we just spent too much time

700
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,120
exploring and not really just like

701
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:30,039
locking down the people we knew we

702
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,039
wanted um in terms of bias uh

703
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,279
yes and no um I don't think the bias is

704
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,320
against hard tech specifically I think

705
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,679
the

706
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:43,880
bias um is against the timeline of

707
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:49,399
hardtech or deep Tech so there's

708
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:52,559
distinctions now between those two words

709
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:56,200
um I think a lot of a lot of investors

710
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,399
really can't handle long timelines or or

711
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,440
whatnot and the way that I kind of

712
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,039
describe it most people don't really

713
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,159
understand how this works is um is

714
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,760
VCS uh there's the general Partners

715
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,559
which are like operational and then they

716
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,159
actually have their own investors so so

717
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,679
they're actually more like

718
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,679
middlemen uh and they actually also kind

719
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,600
of act like startups and so uh so a fund

720
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,200
is raised and then usually progresses

721
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,279
through like a three-year

722
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,080
timeline um before like they have to

723
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,480
fund raise again for another fund if

724
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,600
they're going to continue to to kind of

725
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,960
operate um and so what

726
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,919
that places it places pressure kind of

727
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,600
on startups to really exit or or show

728
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,880
growth within those timelines so that

729
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,760
they actually can keep their jobs uh to

730
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,799
their own

731
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,480
investors um and so that's I think where

732
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,200
the bias comes in is that hardtech is

733
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,360
just really difficult to to kind of grow

734
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,519
on those time

735
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,240
scales um and and I think that's where

736
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,240
really the bias comes in

737
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,240
um u a question that follows

738
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:01,240
uh because people are excited about

739
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,679
active

740
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:07,000
surfaces uh is uh about your next hiring

741
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,279
at your team uh are you interested in

742
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,440
growing your team with PhD students at

743
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,000
this stage or other

744
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,600
Talent

745
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,600
um so so I'll go back to the team slide

746
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:26,600
right now

747
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:29,760
um uh we we hire

748
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,760
um on kind of two main so our hiring

749
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,760
process for these guys was actually kind

750
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,679
of long and and the reason why is

751
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,240
because we weren't hiring on

752
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,080
Direct uh like a research experience I

753
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,799
know a lot of like our competitors kind

754
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,799
of do that they look at Publications we

755
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,039
don't actually care too heavily about

756
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:48,120
publication

757
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,720
history um with our hiring uh we care

758
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,080
about kind of foundational knowledge

759
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,399
willingness to learn and excitement to

760
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,279
the uh to the end goal um everyone on

761
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,000
our Tech Team Jeremiah Austin Matt um

762
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,120
well not Jay I guess but he has a

763
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
relatively long amount of time in the

764
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,840
lab and then Elise are all

765
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,519
phds um so Jeremiah's late stage career

766
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,519
I mean got his PhD from Yukon but it's

767
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,399
not relevant anymore Austin's from Rice

768
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,559
Matt's from pit uh Elis is from

769
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,120
Stanford um so the materials engineer

770
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,480
position that we do have open right now

771
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:31,720
on our site that's uh mostly for an

772
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:35,200
early career p HD uh graduate uh the

773
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,360
other one the RO to uh we kind of

774
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,799
flip-flop it it hasn't been officially

775
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,960
posted yet but it's probably going to be

776
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,120
uh more dependent on the the type of

777
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,120
applicant we get rather

778
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:53,080
than the U another question yeah another

779
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,720
question is just uh the way you're

780
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,320
thinking about finding that appropriate

781
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,000
VC um uh the question is what kind of

782
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,639
investor and people would you suggest

783
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,600
looking for especially keeping a balance

784
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:08,559
between the trust and Technology

785
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,039
understanding what kind of insights you

786
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,039
might have on

787
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:21,480
that trust is the most important thing

788
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:25,559
um I think a lot of the reason

789
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,559
why we fundrais the way we did is

790
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:31,360
because uh the

791
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,960
built uh through personal relationships

792
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,960
prior to

793
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,960
investment

794
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,240
um you know maybe another way to phrase

795
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,760
it on kind of how to think about this

796
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,039
and the way I think about a lot is like

797
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,799
okay someone someone and it's a single

798
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,320
person or two people is going to

799
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,760
eventually make the decision that

800
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,240
they're going to give

801
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,840
you either five figures or six

802
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,200
figures what in your own mind would you

803
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,799
want to see to like validate that among

804
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,000
yourself and like some of it is

805
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,480
technical confidence and then some of it

806
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,560
is like just trust that this person's

807
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,679
not going to screw with you and that

808
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,399
second part is the hardest one uh

809
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,879
technical confidence is metrics and

810
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,879
trust is is personal

811
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,639
relationships I can't I can't agree with

812
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,359
you

813
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:26,800
more um I see uh uh Alan tan Alvin tan

814
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:31,119
uh raised his hand uh do you mind

815
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,119
unmuting yourself and uh asking a

816
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,240
question hi Richard U this Alvin calling

817
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,040
from

818
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Singapore good to see you uh thank you

819
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,399
for youred

820
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,760
sharing um so you had a really

821
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:51,200
interesting quote there um it went

822
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,280
something along like uh even if the

823
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,839
company doesn't do well your career will

824
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,240
be fine I thought that was really

825
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:01,240
interesting and uh kind of paradoxical

826
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,560
so I wonder if you would like to

827
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,560
elaborate more on

828
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,520
that yeah um so it's it's kind of

829
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,400
paraphrased from a conversation I had

830
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,000
with Mitchell from

831
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,720
inab uh at one point um and I've talked

832
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,880
to other Founders about it too um

833
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
especially when like the company their

834
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,520
company has gone under in some way shape

835
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,720
or form and like what that transition

836
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,440
was between uh first company and second

837
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,640
company if they do that or first company

838
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,640
in some other

839
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,640
role

840
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,960
um yeah it's I I don't know I don't I

841
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,079
don't have a good way to like single

842
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,000
describe that it's just kind of

843
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,760
something that that you see more and

844
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,640
more is that like okay if the company

845
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,400
fails itself right and and doesn't do

846
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,599
well and and we don't create market

847
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,640
value and we don't scale up um

848
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,800
you know all the skills that I would

849
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,720
have learned throughout the way of

850
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,560
managing a team you know doing books

851
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,680
doing taxes doing SEC filings

852
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,599
doing uh Tech development leading a

853
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,359
group all those things are translatable

854
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:19,960
to something else uh maybe not

855
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,560
necessarily solar if there are no other

856
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,560
solar companies interested but

857
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,839
definitely uh is useful advice to to

858
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:33,400
some someone new who wants to come along

859
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:36,079
and uh try something else in the market

860
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,319
um you know you learn a lot of things

861
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,040
that are not I guess specific to your

862
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,520
own industry and those things are just

863
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,880
as valuable for your personal career

864
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,240
growth um as is the companies I guess is

865
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,520
the way about it so there's a lot of

866
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,760
people try to isolate this um I guess is

867
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,240
another way to say it like there's your

868
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,119
personal career growth and then there's

869
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,000
the company's growth and like you have

870
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:02,680
to separate those two out um to

871
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,240
uh prevent I guess the the the low days

872
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,800
from being as low as they are because

873
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,800
like your personal career is not really

874
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,200
going to be affected when the company

875
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,200
itself has is a negative

876
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,960
day that's great perspective thank you

877
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,520
for

878
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,200
sharing Alvin thank you so much for

879
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,720
asking I I think that is fantastic

880
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,160
moment to unfortunately have to stop uh

881
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,440
this uh Nano exploration seminar Richard

882
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,119
thank you thanks a ton uh for being

883
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:38,520
frank sharing your journey uh it is many

884
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,599
ups and downs uh that have led you to

885
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,680
the present state of being way up from

886
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,160
where you started um thank you

887
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,880
congratulations uh on launching active

888
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,000
surfaces and building it to where it is

889
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,839
and you know if you don't mind four

890
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,839
years from now we'll call you again when

891
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,160
uh active surfaces is reaching million

892
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:02,319
users and and changing the world uh just

893
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,880
to give us yet another seminar on uh

894
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:06,119
what success of building a basic idea

895
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,280
can grow

896
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,680
into so with that uh I will conclude uh

897
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,720
this seminar I would like to also tell
