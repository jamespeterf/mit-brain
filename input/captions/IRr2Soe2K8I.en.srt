1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,880
My name is Tabitha Wanjira.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,600
I am the  founder of IConnect
Kenya, based here in Kakuma refugee camp.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,080
I would say one. I'm hardworking.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,600
Two. Ambitious.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Three I'm very corroborating.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,040
We thought about coming up with Kakuma

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,000
Digi Connect to bring together
people who are leading media houses,

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,400
and also people who are leading different
digital hubs here in Kakuma.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
There's always a gap when it comes
to innovation and creativity.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,840
It's the high time
we think about creating platforms.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,840
As Iconnect
to where people can come together.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,160
I have seen a lot of support
also coming in

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,880
for refugee sessions because they are
people like the Migration Summit.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,320
They fund people directly
to be able to do their own events

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,480
and different action to rally up

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,680
conversations
around migration, which is very good.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,480

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,600
You find that most of

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,280
the times when working with these 
individual people or working with groups,

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,680
you'll find some of the people we work
with, they do not have formal registration

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,280
when it comes to like having legal
documentation.

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,320
It's a challenge
for some of these creatives.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,200
Also, when it comes to business
registration and without the refugee ID,

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,200
you cannot be able to open KRA Pin.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,360
You cannot be able to register a company
and the agencies around here,

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,640
they demand that you always
you have to have the form or registration.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,680
So this becomes a hindrance
for these people,

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640
even if they're in a position
to work with agencies.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,360
The opportunity goes to someone else.
