1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,440
I'm Ed Chung. Um I'm COO and co-founder

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,240
of Black Mesa. Um I have bachelors in

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,880
the course 7 and 10C from back in 99. My

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,679
co-founder um is HST alum uh from the

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,359
church lab. So we are trying to provide

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,279
process process assurance and bio

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,880
manufacturing. So if you know the

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,560
biommanufacturing industry, you know

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
that so much other industry there's a

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,560
lot of push towards automation and

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,439
computerization. This is great. Um the

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,599
issue is that there's still just a

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
minority of manufacturers out there who

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,640
have completely electronic systems.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,559
Probably the vast majority still on

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,719
either hybrid electronic and paper

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,280
systems or completely paperbased systems

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,000
where all manufacturing records are

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,879
produced and documented on paper. And so

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,800
what we're trying to do is use AI to

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
bridge that gap to give these companies

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,320
the benefits of electronic batch record

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,079
systems or manufacturing execution

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,359
systems without all the cost time hassle

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
of migrating to a big enterprise level

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
solution.

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,000
So we've done the work on this and we

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
actually look back at FDA 483 letters

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
and these aren't letters that are

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
pleasant to get. These are the uh

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,600
letters you get from the FDA um in

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,520
response to inspections that identify uh

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,960
deficiencies. And so if you look back at

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,520
these 483s, 48% of them uh come from

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,000
documentation data integrity errors. So

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,479
in manufacturing in bio, there's a lot

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
of issues with documentation.

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,080
On top of this, we know that sub% of

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,720
batches just fail and usually from

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,200
contamination user error. And on top of

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,040
that, you have this QA system in biio

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,119
manufacturing that's designed to stay on

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,720
top of this, to police it, and to try to

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,759
mitigate these errors when they occur.

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,920
The issue is they have 800,000, 1200

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,320
page batch records to look through page

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,360
by page in order to execute their QA

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,520
functions. And even in the professional

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,600
proof reading industry, there's a 6%

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,840
error rate there. So, this is an area

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,399
that's just rife for disruption and

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,520
optimization with AI. So, here's how we

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
do it. So the company just uploads their

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,840
blank master batch records to our system

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
called Veriscan. We don't alter their

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
records. We don't have them create a new

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,760
system. We just ingest whatever they

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,720
have. Um they view it within our system,

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,640
print it out like usual and then the

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,879
manufacturing floor, the technicians,

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,120
they execute their processes and they

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,440
document just like usual. You'll notice

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,520
that there's basically no change um in

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
this in this process from prior

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
workflows. We try to meet people where

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,360
they are.

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
Um, the little change that we that we

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
add to the batch record is that we put a

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,760
unique uh 2D barcode up in the corner of

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,319
the batch record that allows us to trace

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,000
every page throughout the whole

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,200
manufacturing production cycle so that

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
if you were actually to take two

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,440
different batch records, shuffle them

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,400
and then put them into our system, the

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
system would be able to sort them

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,959
automatically. Not that you should ever

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,959
ever shuffle batch records like

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
um so these pages are scanned at some

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
frequency. It could be every shift,

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,480
every day um to enter them into the

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
system. This is a very, you know,

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
lowmaintenance process. Again, because

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
of the barcode, these technicians just

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,800
walk up to the scanner, put it in, and

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
then pick up the scan files, walk away.

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
There's no sorting or anything that has

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,280
to happen because of that barcode. Then

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,040
our AI models automatically identify the

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,879
documentation issues within those

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,200
documents. So, this could be missing

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,920
signatures, this can be um bad

93
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,159
calculations. Um in addition to that

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,959
they OCR the entire page and capture all

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
the data that's available there. Those

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
alerts then go to the QA team

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
automatically and say hey you have

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
issues here here and here. This is what

99
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,560
you need to do to to identify that uh to

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,080
to mitigate that. Um and in addition we

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
allow these documents we allow this

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
production of record to be shared in

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,200
basically near real time with

104
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,080
stakeholders whether that's a sponsor um

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,080
government observer what have you.

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
And so the end value propositions

107
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,560
obviously QA has helped a lot because

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,640
they're allowed now to essentially

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
review by exception. Instead of looking

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,560
again through a thousand pages of batch

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,799
record line by line they can just be

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,000
alerted to where the actual issues are.

113
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,239
Um number two shorter QA times allows

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you to release batches more quickly and

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,680
so then a manufacturing facility can

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,239
actually fit in more batches within a

117
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,959
given amount of time.

118
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,040
Um and then lastly

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,720
in manufacturer by offering increased

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,199
transparency into their manufacturing

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,440
process actually attracts sponsors who

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,040
need that sort of visibility into you

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,600
know where their baby how their baby

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
project is doing. Um and again that same

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
data that we OCR and capture from these

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
documents that is data that's now

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
available for trending for analytics

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
that was not available before previously

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,160
locked in paper repositories but now

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,560
available for digital analysis.

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
Um as sort of a case in point um our

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,800
first install is actually happening next

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,639
month with a stealth startup um that is

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,280
using Indian source body manufacturing

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,440
resources for better for worse uh

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,080
wrongly or rightly um Indian body

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,800
manufacturing has an has a reputation of

138
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,600
being somewhat lower quality. Um on top

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,000
of that um they have almost universally

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
paperbased processes. Um this is in a

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
context of more and more bio

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,080
manufacturing actually going to India

143
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
being outsourced to India. Um and they

144
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,360
are in a financial situation where a

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
full electronic batch record or

146
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
manufacturing execution system makes

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
zero financial sense and so they're

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,440
bringing us in they're bringing very

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,240
scan in to provide um a number of

150
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,080
solutions to the situation. So we have a

151
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,160
cryptograph cryptographically secured

152
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,160
timestamp manufacturing record that

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
results from our scanning process. So

154
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,039
this helps regulators, this helps

155
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
sponsors feel more confidence and

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,600
assurance in what's being done. Uh

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
contemporaneous QA allows them to again

158
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,919
speed batch release, get paid faster and

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,120
actually fit more batches in a given

160
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,800
year. Um and they are using beer scan to

161
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,560
actually extract data from prior batches

162
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,440
to then use for future process

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
improvement and trending. Um and lastly

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,840
the process transparency that Veriscan

165
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
offers um benefits their sponsors who

166
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,880
now instead of having to spend send the

167
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,720
person overseas to India to monitor by

168
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,800
manufacturing processes can actually

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,520
look remotely as it happens.

170
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,199
Um so we are looking for more clients.

171
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,960
Uh potential clients for us include

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,840
CDMOs. These are the contract drug

173
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,720
manufacturers who make substance for

174
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
sponsors who own the molecule rights. Um

175
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,759
farmers themselves also are potential

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
clients for us whether they do their own

177
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,759
production inhouse or outsource. Um and

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
obviously um we are very open to

179
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
international engagements. Um we do have

180
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,199
we are a past performer for HHS a sole

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,440
source uh uh for the for the US

182
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,400
government as well. Um we have ongoing

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,240
contracts with DARPA and a pending award

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,600
with ARPAH. So we also have interest in

185
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,759
government and national national

186
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,120
