1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
Thanks everyone. Um it's fun to be here.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,680
We can keep this as like interactive as

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,120
possible. Um sort of just like you know

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,960
maybe don't scream it out but you can

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,120
raise your hands and happy to sort of

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,040
keep it interactive. Um sorry for the

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
title change. I'm now one of those

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
people who just sends a generic title

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,039
and abstract and then talks about what

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,480
I'm currently interested in. Um but no

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,080
I'm going to talk about this the same

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,439
thing just under a different title and a

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,080
different framing. Um and so sort of um

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,960
so so the title of this talk is sort of

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,719
at a high level I think connecting uh a

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,399
lot of sort of the type of work that

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,640
I've done my group has done over the

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,399
last few years which is sort of the

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,719
following which is so I I I sort of grew

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,719
up in the econ

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,200
the like sort of the fundamental

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079
assumption right so like like the core

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,280
belief of the econs community is that

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,520
people have information and preferences

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,760
that sort of central planners do not or

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,320
central mechanisms do not and that it's

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
important to sort of uncover

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
those preferences or information in

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,760
order to do things right so we have

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,840
democracy democracy is good um and so

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
you know people vote on things um sort

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
of out of the econs community we have

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,280
things like participatory budgeting or

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
deliberative democracy and it's sort of

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,240
people are voting in complex spaces

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,240
right um sort of a lot of my sort of

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
early work as faculty was sort of on

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,640
crowdsourcing systems so in New York

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,600
city and in Boston things like 311 where

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,200
like you complain about potholes and um

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,439
sort of noise complaints and trees

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,920
falling down um and things that like

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,159
sort of you need the government to fix.

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,520
um sort of what I'll mostly spend today

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,759
talking about is also in Boston and New

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,119
York City um and many urban centers

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,119
throughout the United States and

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,680
throughout the globe. Um we have things

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,360
like school matching where sort of even

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
to get into elementary school or middle

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
school or high school um and then you

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,719
know residents you know med school

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,640
students residencies um you sort of um

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,960
the the student side submits a rank list

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
of their preferences over the other side

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,799
and then schools do the same thing and

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,640
then a central algorithm decides who

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,400
goes where

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,920
and like sort of empirically and this is

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,800
just sort of just like an empirical fact

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,280
that has been shown repeatedly in a

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,599
whole bunch of sort of contexts

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,160
including a lot of sort of uh my group's

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,959
work over the last few years. Um it's

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,280
just the fact that participation is

66
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,760
often low and is especially

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,879
heterogeneous in these systems, right?

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
Right. So, like in New York City,

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,280
participatory budgeting, um, where sort

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,120
of you vote for how much like your

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
neighborhood spends millions of dollars,

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,959
like does this school get a bathroom or

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,879
that school or like libraries or things

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
like that, sort of voting rates are

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,680
around 2% depending on how you count the

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,160
voting population. Um, and it sort of

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,120
differs by socioeconomics.

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
um and sort of these crowdsourcing 311

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,920
type systems sort of neighborhoods

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
request service at different rates in

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,159
ways that correlate with socioeconomics

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,480
even controlling for need right so like

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,200
even controlling for like how many

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,200
potholes there are um sort of u and you

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
know doing that controlling is that the

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,519
hard part methically but sort of ones

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,280
you can control for things like that um

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
sort of neighborhoods request service at

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,560
different rates um sort of in what I'm

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,200
going to talk about for most of today is

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
in sort of in school matching. Um

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,840
families might have heterogeneous

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,000
awareness of highquality options or sort

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
of things like you know their their

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
beliefs about admissions rates at these

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,959
schools and so on. And so so that causes

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,200
sort of differences behavior.

98
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,879
Um and so a lot of sort of the driving

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
belief of my group's work over the last

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,920
few years has been sort of like this is

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,000
a bad thing, right? And this is part

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,840
sort of probably um the biggest threat

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,760
to the legitimacy of I think the core

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,319
belief of econs right is sort of um that

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
sort of we need to deal with sort of

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,040
this heterogeneous behavior um if if if

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
we sort of want to sort of our systems

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,239
to grow

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,920
um and sort of I have um a paper in the

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,439
sort of the SIG comics changes the

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
newsletter. Um

112
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
>> could you just reiterate what you mean

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,400
what you mean by what exactly is the

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
biggest

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,639
>> Yeah. So sort of I think heterogeneous

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,600
participation and the resulting

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,360
inequities that result because sort of

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,759
in our system. So in what I'm going to

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,219
talk about today, for the most part,

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,120
it's going to be sort of um if

121
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:33,520
[clears throat] students or families

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,600
have um sort of different ability to

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,320
fully participate in the school matching

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,040
system, then sort of that leads to um

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,199
inequities in who gets into sort of top

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,440
high schools even sort of controlling

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,080
for who's eligible for top high schools

128
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,560
and sort of so sort of inequities and

129
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,960
inefficiencies caused by sort of this

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,320
type of participation differences is I

131
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,280
think sort of the biggest threat to the

132
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,000
legitimacy of these type of systems.

133
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah. Great.

134
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,800
Um and so um you know I probably won't

135
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,080
get very far in talking about the other

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,120
direction. So, but what I'm going to try

137
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,360
to do in this talk is sort of primarily

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
talk about sort of these sort of ideas

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,400
um in sort of behavior in and sort of

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
now um in RCT that we're um sort of

141
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,000
running and in sort of the New York City

142
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,919
high school applications context and um

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,400
sort of and then you know if I get there

144
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,039
overview a few other directions and my

145
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,039
hope to you is to convince you that one

146
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,560
sort of um the thing that I said on the

147
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,960
previous slide is true that

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,000
heterogeneous participation matters

149
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,320
Um two is sort of um there's a whole lot

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,440
of interesting work to do um from sort

151
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,360
of theory to empirics to HCI um

152
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:53,280
deployments RCT that kind of stuff

153
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,960
um and sort of not just sort of um

154
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,520
heterogene this is sort of maybe a more

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,360
technical point but sort of not just uh

156
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
is heterogeneous participation a thing

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,560
but sort of um you know one of the

158
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,479
mechanisms that we're going to talk

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,000
about is then give is sort of

160
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,319
recommendations to try uh um sort of fix

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,400
this issue and sort of their um

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,479
heterogeneous uh information provision

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,720
which you know various folks here have

164
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,840
also worked on um sort of also matters

165
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
right so you might need to give

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,199
different information um to different

167
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,960
people um and sort of I'll I'll talk a

168
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,759
little bit more about what I mean later

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,600
on okay so but for most of this talk I'm

170
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,360
going to talk about sort of these two

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,199
papers um the first one is written it's

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,919
not online yet, but happy to sort of

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,639
share share a copy um if anyone wants

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,560
one. It's 100 matching in New York City

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
um school choice application behavior

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,960
and the potential personalized feedback.

177
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,360
Um it's sort of exclusively a historical

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,160
descriptive paper um sort of with Kenny

179
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,800
Pang and Emily Rue were the lead um

180
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,599
student PhDs and then also with John and

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,400
Ava. Uh and then sort of the second

182
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,919
project is sort of our ongoing work um

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,000
sort of our our RCT sort of our our sort

184
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,160
of the interventional piece uh

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
personalized nudges under congestion and

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,400
the New York City high school match sort

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,440
of led by PhD student Erica Chang also

188
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,440
with Kenny John and Ava.

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,520
Great. Okay. So what's the context? The

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,039
context is that every year um about 70

191
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,240
plus thousand um eighth graders apply to

192
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,960
about 8 to 900 high school programs in

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,120
New York City. And historically this

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,160
meant that they could rank up to 12 of

195
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,919
these 900 plus programs and then match

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
their deferred acceptance. As of last

197
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,000
year um they can rank as many as they

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,759
want.

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,759
Um and then sort of empirically

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
um we know that there are disparities in

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,520
where students attend high school,

202
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,599
right? So the median black or Hispanic

203
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,520
student matches to a program um with uh

204
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,039
almost double higher fraction of

205
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,000
students who did not graduate high

206
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,479
school about 43 higher fraction who did

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,400
not enroll in college. Um and then lower

208
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,520
school impact or sorry lower school

209
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
performance which is sort of a

210
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,440
combination measure and then lower

211
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,000
school impact which is sort of trying to

212
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,000
do like the causal thing of the um sort

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,360
of the performance measure. So trying to

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,400
control for um sort of uh input

215
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,000
performance of eighth graders, right? So

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,879
sort of there are disparities and who

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,959
goes to school where.

218
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,080
And you know there's at least three

219
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,640
potential sources of disparities. Um,

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
one sort of source or two of the sources

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,200
you can think about are maybe sort of

222
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,160
supply side disparities, right? So like

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,120
where physically are the high performing

224
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,440
schools and sort of where do students

225
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,240
live, right? Like geographic segregation

226
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,760
um still exists. Um, and so you can

227
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,480
think about sort of geography and

228
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,080
location of high performing schools. Uh,

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,880
you can also think about admissions

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,760
policies, right? So um as I'll describe

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,160
in a little bit, New York City has sort

232
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,080
of um a fairly extensive and complex um

233
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,880
sort of way in that students are ranked

234
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,080
for admission. So many so about 200

235
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,120
school 200 of the 900 programs um are

236
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,040
screened schools which means they use um

237
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,480
grades and historically things like test

238
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,360
scores in order to um rank students um

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,040
and then admit by that. Um, and so, you

240
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,880
know, some other schools use geographic

241
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,720
zoning. Um, and then there's like all

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,120
sorts of other preferences, right? So,

243
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,959
you could believe that even if sort of

244
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
schools are physically accessible, maybe

245
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,640
they're not accessible because of

246
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,440
admissions policies, right? So, these

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,440
are maybe supply side um sources of

248
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,160
disparities.

249
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,720
Um what we're going to focus on in this

250
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,160
line of work is uh maybe the sort of uh

251
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
I don't know if demand side is the right

252
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,959
word but sort of application behavior

253
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,600
sort of component of disparities which

254
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,920
is controlling for and I'll be more

255
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,160
specific by what I mean in a little bit.

256
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,040
Um but controlling for geography and

257
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,000
admissions policies um disadvantaged

258
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,240
students may not apply um and match to

259
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,160
high performing schools. And you could

260
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,760
you can say you you know you and maybe

261
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,200
these differences exist for many

262
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
reasons, right? Maybe it's like a true

263
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,399
preference um sort of like true

264
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,480
preferences around sort of around

265
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,360
geography or true preference around peer

266
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,440
groups or all sorts of preferences over

267
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,920
sort of where they want to go to school.

268
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,320
Or you could uh do uh blame things like

269
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,680
a complex process, right? that like this

270
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,240
is just a hard process

271
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,920
in like applying to high schools in New

272
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,959
York City is like a hard stressful

273
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,959
process, right? So, like I said, there's

274
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,480
like 8 to 900 different programs. I

275
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,399
think this year it was over 900

276
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,160
programs. They're all throughout the

277
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,320
city. um each of them have sort of a

278
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,440
different set of maybe language courses

279
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,440
and AP courses and arts courses and

280
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,760
different sports that they offer and

281
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,560
different like after school activities.

282
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,160
Um and then New York City also publishes

283
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,240
like all of these quantitative metrics

284
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,880
for each school. So like performance and

285
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
impact um like I talked about earlier

286
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,399
and then also a whole bunch of like

287
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,440
survey data. So New York City for each

288
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,560
school publishes things like surveys of

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,120
families, parents, students of each

290
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,360
school. Things like how is this school

291
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
on like the school's relationship with

292
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,519
families or safety and school climate

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
instruction and performance, right? So

294
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,399
like there's like an incredible overload

295
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,640
of information and choices um that

296
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,000
parents have

297
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,560
uh in this process.

298
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Any thoughts or questions so far?

299
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,839
What what is impact and performance?

300
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,160
It says that impact is measured against

301
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,760
expected outcomes. Yeah. Adjusted for

302
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
incoming student factors.

303
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
>> Yeah.

304
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
>> So running some kind of regression on

305
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
this.

306
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,320
>> Yeah. Great. So um how this score is is

307
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
exactly that. So it's like essentially

308
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
it's like I don't even think it's as

309
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,240
fancy as a regression. I think it's um

310
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,560
like literally like means amongst

311
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,200
comparable schools by incoming class. Um

312
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,600
there's like an a really great line of

313
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
work. So like folks here at MIT, so

314
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,920
Paragatic, Josh Angoras, sort of those

315
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,120
sort of folks u who've been thinking

316
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,600
much more carefully about like sort of

317
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,519
like much more directly causal inference

318
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
sort of ways to calculate this taking

319
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,320
advantage of the fact that the match is

320
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,560
random, right? So like that induces

321
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,079
randomness which sort of gets you sort

322
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:50,279
of much more like causal measures. Um

323
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,279
but that's not what's shown online.

324
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,279
Other thoughts or questions?

325
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,120
Okay, great. So this is like a hard

326
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,600
process.

327
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,440
Um, and I'll show this fun thing in a

328
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,279
few slides, which is like if you're

329
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
rich, you can, so like if any of you

330
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,560
Google New York City high school match

331
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
and you don't have a ad blocker, you're

332
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,800
going to see a bunch of ads for

333
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,040
consulting services to help you apply

334
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,440
for the high school match.

335
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,360
>> Yeah. Sorry, I'm just confused about a

336
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,720
lot of this because you know if the

337
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,760
thing that you're trying to um you know

338
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,720
test is about participation and so

339
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
economic

340
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,279
>> stuff then this is kind of a fraud

341
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,279
example just because like you're saying

342
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,920
there's so many complexities right and

343
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,800
also the whole school choice thing was

344
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,720
introduced you know kind of for a reason

345
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,079
there's this you know they want people

346
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,800
to think like uh you know especially the

347
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,399
lower socio economic classes have been

348
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
discriminated against, you know,

349
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,760
chronically.

350
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:57,199
>> And then, you know, this was set up to

351
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,279
try to uh essentially um uh devalue

352
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,959
public schools so that the rich would be

353
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,040
going private schools, right? And so,

354
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,600
you know, there's that whole thing. And

355
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:13,600
and and so sometimes people can be um uh

356
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,079
let's say cynical about whether the

357
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,240
participation process really has an

358
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,000
effect will really will give them more

359
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,839
educational opportunity.

360
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,399
>> Uh I I I would say that sort of like if

361
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,519
you go to the rhetoric of sort of like

362
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
you know Bloomberg administration

363
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
imposition of school choice. It very

364
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,839
much was like an equality of opportunity

365
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,880
argument, right? It sort of you should

366
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,560
allow people access to schools um that

367
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,279
are high performing that they might not

368
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,279
be geographically zoned to. Um, and so

369
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,800
part of I think what we're going to try

370
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,959
to think about is sort of um and you

371
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,360
know I I I think that's that's great.

372
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,959
Uh, and sort of part of what we're going

373
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
to think about is sort of how can we

374
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,519
help with the application process in

375
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,839
order to sort of like help maybe achieve

376
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,800
some of those equality of opportunity

377
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:09,120
>> aspects. Why is there that so the what

378
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,519
is it? Why is there that socio that

379
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,639
geographic difference you know? Yeah.

380
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,880
>> So, you know, I'm just not sure that,

381
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,880
you know, how much did you even if

382
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,199
everybody participated

383
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,199
forms makes all the choices, you know,

384
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,639
will that really will honestly

385
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
>> Yeah, great question. So like this is

386
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,680
what we're going to try to do and I'll

387
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,720
show you hopefully some results in a few

388
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,639
slides in which sort of trying to

389
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,399
compare at least a little bit um sort of

390
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,839
uh sort of disparities due to

391
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,000
application behavior as opposed to

392
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,920
disparities due to sort of geography and

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,440
other aspects.

394
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Okay. And so this is new as of last year

395
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,639
sort of by done by a couple researchers

396
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,199
who were at MIT um Bola Cordini and

397
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,759
Cleman Zaido which is sort of as of last

398
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:02,399
year in New York City um you can see

399
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,800
your admissions chances at each school

400
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,720
at the individual level right so you can

401
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,680
see um in high medium or low sort of

402
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,120
discretized buckets um what your chance

403
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,040
is at an individual school Um, and we're

404
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,680
like they say that high means that you

405
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,480
have about a 99% chance of getting into

406
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,959
a program. Low means that you have about

407
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,680
a 1% chance and then medium is

408
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,320
everything in the middle.

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,560
Um

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,199
there there's a lot of I think um good

411
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,320
re yeah we can talk about the design of

412
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,440
sort of these um sort of buckets. No, I

413
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,720
think there's I think I think there's

414
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
some really nice reasons that you would

415
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,279
want to do something like this. we

416
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,399
should, you know, happy to talk about

417
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,480
the design um offline. Um but this is

418
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,880
sort of what the design is in New York

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
City, right? And and I think this is

420
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,880
great. So like I think sort of this is a

421
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,360
sort of a big step toward helping sort

422
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,000
of students um apply sort of apply to

423
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,160
schools, right? Because now you have um

424
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,319
sort of some personalized admissions

425
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,319
likelihoods,

426
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,799
right? Okay. And so empirically, not are

427
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,799
there just match disparities.

428
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,799
Yeah.

429
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,439
>> Um

430
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,959
>> I mean it's it's it's the centralized

431
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,120
system so they know everything, right?

432
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,600
But they what they actually use are

433
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,880
things like uh at this point literally

434
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,520
just discretized grades um zoning

435
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,360
information. So like as course as Burrow

436
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
and then some schools have like weird

437
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,600
like south of Hston Street and so like

438
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,720
like zoning um free and reduced lunch

439
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,400
eligibility um which is used for sort of

440
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,280
a version of affirmative action um and

441
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,440
then a few other criteria.

442
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,039
Great. And so what I'm showing you on

443
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,480
this screen is so in orange it's

444
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,240
students who are eligible for free and

445
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,799
reduced lunch eligibility. Um blue is

446
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,120
students not eligible for free and

447
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:12,160
reduced lunch and on the x-axis is um

448
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,840
sort of like the rank in the list. So

449
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
the first program they listed, the

450
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,520
second program they listed all the way

451
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,960
to the 12th program they listed. And so

452
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,320
then on the plot on the left is the

453
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,440
selectivity of the program they applied

454
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,120
to. So that means sort of on average a

455
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,000
student eligible for free and reduced

456
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,120
lunch applied to a program that accepted

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,360
40% of its students um in their first

458
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,799
list first point of the list. For a

459
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,280
non-FRL student this is about 25%.

460
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,960
Right? So sort of at every level um

461
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
students eligible for free and reduced

462
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,039
lunch are sort of applying to less

463
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,400
competitive programs. And then on the

464
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,640
plot on the right, you have the same

465
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
thing but graduation rates.

466
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
>> I have just a question about New York

467
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,640
City. Um for the y- axis on the right

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,480
hand side, is the twopart percentage

469
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,160
point gap in graduation rate like

470
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,720
meaningful? Like what's the range?

471
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,200
>> Yeah. So I mean at this point um New

472
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,440
York City sort of has like surprisingly

473
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
high or surprising to me um high

474
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,600
graduation rates in high school. I think

475
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,440
it's like over 85%.

476
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,760
Um yeah. Yeah. So, so this is like like

477
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,039
a substantial portion of the the

478
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,039
remaining. Yeah.

479
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,080
Um Yeah. So, sort of um yeah, same

480
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,520
disparity sort of if you look at either

481
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,520
by selectivity or by offer rate.

482
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,960
>> Yeah. Yeah. So like I think you can say

483
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,120
many reasons why this is happening. um

484
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,840
you know so some things that could be

485
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,000
happening is maybe these correspond to

486
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,320
their true preferences right so like

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,320
there's other things you know there's

488
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,840
other sort of characteristics of these

489
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,000
schools um around geography peer group

490
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,760
um sport you know all sorts of things

491
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
that you might have preferences over for

492
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,880
schools language programs and like you

493
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,960
know when you look at graduations and

494
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,640
selectivity this is what happens but

495
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,679
sort of there's other reasons to prefer

496
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,280
these schools

497
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,320
Um, so you can tell a true preference

498
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,600
story. Um, you can tell sort of an

499
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,799
admissions probability story, which is

500
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,760
um sort of uh and I'll get into this a

501
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,600
little bit is uh when you're limited to

502
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,679
12 schools, you you need sort of

503
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
theoretic it's deferred acceptance isn't

504
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,200
strategy proof anymore. You can't just

505
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,840
apply to your favorite 12 schools. You

506
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,840
need to do like a reach mat safety um

507
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
sort of approach. And so maybe this is

508
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,520
corresponding to admissions

509
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,200
probabilities. um or maybe this is

510
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,200
corresponding to ge like you know this

511
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,039
goes back to the first argument is like

512
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,240
around two preferences is maybe this is

513
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,559
geography right so um this by itself is

514
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,919
no is not evidence of like much right

515
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,320
all this is saying is there are

516
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,159
application differences and there's many

517
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,280
reasons one could believe that these

518
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,280
application differences arise

519
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,520
okay and so there's a large um there's a

520
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,559
large literature sort of on these type

521
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,760
of application differences uh on ranking

522
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,880
and matching disparities. Um but sort of

523
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,640
um sort of maybe uh one summary of it is

524
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,120
is that disadvantaged students are less

525
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,200
likely to apply and match to quote

526
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,080
unquote highquality schools even

527
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,679
conditioned on things like grades. Um

528
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,960
there's sort of a large emerging

529
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,720
um sort of line of work that sort of

530
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,760
trying to say that this is evidence of

531
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,240
mistakes that applicants are making as

532
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,960
opposed to just a preference story and

533
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,880
sort of so how do they do this? They do

534
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,960
things like they just run surveys of

535
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
families and they in these surveys of

536
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,480
families they ask them okay what are the

537
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,440
characteristics of schools that you

538
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,360
prefer? um sort of are you aware of you

539
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,600
know like they they test for awareness

540
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,080
like are you aware of these high quality

541
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,440
schools in your neighborhood um things

542
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,400
like that right you can also do things

543
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,799
like um just like look at like quasi

544
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,640
experimental things like okay New York

545
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,200
City in like 2014 um introduced certain

546
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,720
letter grades for schools that provided

547
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,960
students more information about school

548
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,360
quality how did that change behavior and

549
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,120
then when they took it back How did that

550
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,159
change behavior again? Right.

551
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,320
>> Well, so um that would be a mistake in

552
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
like whether I should have applied to a

553
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,919
place, but this says they're less likely

554
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,000
to apply to and match with the schools

555
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,679
that our grades. Is that

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
>> Oh, sorry. The match because of

557
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,280
application. Yeah.

558
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
>> I can't match. Okay. So, so we don't

559
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,720
you're not claiming that there's

560
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,799
evidence that having applied

561
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,200
>> Yeah. No, no, no, no, no.

562
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,520
>> Match.

563
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,559
>> No, no, no. And and like I think at this

564
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,200
point like applications are basically

565
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,799
fun like formulas for how students are

566
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,000
ranked. So like that would be

567
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,600
>> Yeah. Yeah. No.

568
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
>> No. No. That that would be very

569
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,960
surprising if true.

570
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,960
>> Yeah.

571
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,480
Um and yeah, sorry I couldn't fit this

572
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,520
on the earlier slide, but this is sort

573
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,120
of the like nice consult like Google

574
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,480
consult like all these consultants who

575
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,159
will help you apply if you can afford

576
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
it.

577
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,400
what's the evidence on like whether or

578
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,240
not the uh the families are likely to

579
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,840
strategy because you mentioned

580
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,840
acceptance algorithm like

581
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,000
>> yeah so that that's what sort of we're

582
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,640
going to try to think about um in this

583
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,360
paper is that like sort of even

584
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,919
reasoning on this reach safety sort of

585
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,840
thing

586
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,320
>> what

587
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,320
application designs

588
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,600
are

589
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,039
>> yeah so it used to be much like and and

590
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,960
I think this is just a paper to be

591
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,360
written At this point it's like over the

592
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,320
last 5 years they've simplified it a

593
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,760
lot. So like it used to be like each

594
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,919
school would run their own thing and

595
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,600
sort of like could sort it was like

596
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,559
almost the wild west in what could be

597
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,240
used. So like it was there were like

598
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,400
three performance features. Seventh

599
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,880
grade grades, eighth grade grades, test

600
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,799
scores and they were continuous features

601
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,919
that schools could use in however way.

602
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,080
They could also use um admissions essays

603
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,520
and things like that. Um some schools

604
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,039
would use things like did you show up to

605
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,960
an open house. Um and then sort of

606
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,960
increasingly they've centralized and

607
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,720
limited these things. So there still

608
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,120
exists schools that have auditions and

609
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,200
essays um and interviews and things like

610
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,440
that. But sort of among the quantitative

611
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,320
metrics at this point it's essentially

612
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,320
like discretized grade

613
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,159
and then lottery number within the

614
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,159
discrete buckets.

615
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,679
Yeah. And there's sort of similar

616
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,480
findings outside of New York City and in

617
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,400
college admissions around sort of um

618
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,200
mistakes that people make.

619
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,279
Okay. So what do we do in this work? Um

620
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
sort of get getting at sort of that

621
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,640
question which is like okay so you you

622
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,039
maybe need to reason about strategic

623
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,159
behavior a little bit in the in the

624
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,400
following sense which is so I'm gonna

625
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,400
show you plots like this. um sort of

626
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,799
repeatedly where the x-axis is my

627
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,360
position in the list like what position

628
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,360
in the list I I show I had a school and

629
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,559
the y-axis is like some measure of

630
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,480
school quality for simplicity in this

631
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,880
paper in this talk I'm going to only

632
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,799
focus on selectivity or like offer rate

633
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
where like lower offer rate is better

634
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,360
but sort of essentially all the results

635
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,120
hold for like any performance metric you

636
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,440
care to think about. Um

637
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,760
and so like in so like this is like a

638
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,159
visualization of a student's portfolio

639
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,240
where and sorry and the reason I focus

640
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,440
on offer rate is because it does double

641
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,320
duty then of both of like selectivity as

642
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,720
a imperfect measure of school quality

643
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,159
but then also um it's it's your

644
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,400
admissions likely or it's like an

645
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,960
unconditional admissions likelihood. And

646
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,039
so if for example you apply to 100%

647
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
offer rate school first then it doesn't

648
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,480
matter what the rest of your list says

649
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
right so you you sort of you can

650
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,240
basically ignore the rest of the list

651
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,440
right so this is an example of such a

652
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,240
student who applied to a 100% offer rate

653
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,640
school first match to that program and

654
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,400
it sort of doesn't matter that their six

655
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,360
ranked program um was selective sort of

656
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,679
even if they would have gotten into it

657
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,919
right so the first question that we want

658
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,520
to think about is how do empirical

659
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,799
portfolios differ from what they should

660
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,279
right and by should I mean sort of

661
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,480
there's um like you know you sort of

662
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,559
need to think about the theoretical

663
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,559
question of how should students apply

664
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,200
given short lists and uncertainty right

665
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,000
so given that you can only apply to or

666
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,600
at least historically up to 12 programs

667
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,600
um and there's like uncertainty about

668
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,960
are you going to get in

669
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,400
>> from understanding if there's no

670
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,200
constraint on list then you should just

671
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,960
like rank your favorite thing in a

672
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,799
>> strategically. Yes. Right. So deferred

673
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,159
acceptance is strategy proof if you can

674
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,640
rank all that you want. Um now like in

675
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,159
practice that's like in practice sort of

676
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,120
about half the students even with a

677
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,200
limit of 12 didn't list 12 and like even

678
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,559
right like in practice I think this is

679
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,080
going to remain an issue even if

680
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,600
strategically like I just think the

681
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,520
strategic lens is not the right lens to

682
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,520
look at this. Yeah. And then sort of the

683
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,799
interventional piece that hopefully I'll

684
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,120
get to um is how can we steer students

685
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,200
toward high quality matches.

686
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,120
>> Yeah. Sorry to uh challenge this but I

687
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,320
think there was a news news item that I

688
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,960
think it was sty.

689
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,559
>> Yep.

690
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,440
>> That you know out of thousand

691
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:56,480
there were you know eight black.

692
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,320
So it was just you know to a lot of you

693
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,080
know that indicates that there is some

694
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,559
sociological

695
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,200
uh discrimination that the low-inccome

696
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,120
uh uh you know students don't have an

697
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,720
equal chance when they apply for these

698
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,559
>> Yeah. No no I I I yeah I I I I'm not at

699
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,760
all contesting that. So so I guess

700
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,520
>> saying that that this is a mistake you

701
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,960
know to the applicants and sort of

702
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,799
blaming the victim.

703
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
>> Yeah. No it's okay. Sorry. Yeah. I I

704
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,919
totally do not mean to do that. Um I

705
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,679
think so there are definitely sort of um

706
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,320
I think admission policies and

707
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,399
geographic sort of things going on to

708
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,480
play. I think sort of what I'm trying to

709
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:42,320
do here is um sort of even even sort of

710
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,640
on the application behavior side is um

711
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,720
sort of you know I I I think even on the

712
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,000
application behavior side sort of it's

713
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,240
it by mistake I mean sort of um sort of

714
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
complex process

715
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,360
caused um and so sort of like how can we

716
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,159
like simplify or help in the

717
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,919
applications right so so I I don't sort

718
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,520
of I don't mean to say that oh it's

719
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,279
justified because sort of it's an

720
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,520
application behavior site. No, I just it

721
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,840
seems like this just worse I can just

722
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,320
say I'm not accusing you of saying this

723
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,399
but it just it's not it's maybe not a

724
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,279
very good example for you know studying

725
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,039
application strategy or something right

726
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,760
you know the the the the applicants are

727
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,399
are making a realistic estimate that you

728
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,520
know even if I apply to I'm not going to

729
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,919
get in right

730
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,600
>> yeah so I I think

731
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,960
>> yeah so so here what I'm going to do in

732
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,880
this work is I'm going control for what

733
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,120
you have gotten in and I can do that

734
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,480
perfectly and then I'll show I can tell

735
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,919
you how I will do that perfectly. Um and

736
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,720
and the reason Okay, great.

737
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,760
Right. So, right. Okay. So, maybe I'll

738
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,000
jump to this part, which is sort of to

739
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,159
to do any of this, you need some

740
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,080
estimate of would this applicant have

741
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:03,679
gotten in had they applied, right? And

742
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,520
uh what's nice about New York City is

743
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,880
for about 80. So, like I'm actually not

744
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,159
talking about the nine specialized high

745
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,640
schools. I'm talking about the remaining

746
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,840
like 900 programs, right? So the nine

747
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,360
specialized high schools including

748
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,159
styend like by law well three of them by

749
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,159
law the rest because by choice

750
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,320
essentially they use a single exam and

751
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,320
they run like serial dictatorship for

752
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,159
who goes where. Um I'm talking about the

753
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,440
remaining 900 that participate in the

754
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,200
deferred acceptance system. And of the

755
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,760
remaining 900 that participate in the

756
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:39,679
deferred acceptance system, um about 80%

757
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,080
uh use an application policy that is

758
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,240
perfectly formulaically knowable, right?

759
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,039
They publish it on an Excel that's

760
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,679
online. And so if you had all the

761
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:55,440
inputs, you could and we do to like 95

762
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,960
plus or 99% accuracy reverse engineer

763
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,200
would this student have gotten in had

764
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,039
they applied?

765
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,720
Well, but again, you know, if you talk

766
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,880
about eight black students out of a

767
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,279
thousand, that's a very small sample,

768
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,279
right?

769
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,279
>> Yeah.

770
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:17,200
>> Uh, yeah. No, I I think so. The the

771
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,840
features that sort of they use do not

772
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,080
use race.

773
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,760
>> No, Iconomics.

774
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,080
>> Oh, yeah.

775
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,000
>> The point of view of the applicants, you

776
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,240
know, there's only people like down to

777
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
that.

778
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,360
>> Oh, totally. Yeah. So, I think there's

779
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,720
many other sort of um like preference

780
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,960
based reasons you might not want to

781
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,919
apply or you might not choose to apply.

782
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,960
I think what I'm trying to say is sort

783
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,799
of um given the simulator, we can at

784
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,679
least in hindsight say would they have

785
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,360
gotten in had they applied?

786
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,760
>> And so the one% left in the Excel

787
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,360
spreadsheet formula is like who else is

788
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,880
sort of

789
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,480
>> Yeah, that's a good no. Well, it's it's

790
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,880
not like equilibrium effects like that

791
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,559
sort of it's like sort of this 5 to 1%

792
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,799
error still is even without those

793
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,279
effects. It's like it's like partially

794
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,200
rounding and then partially like they're

795
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,279
like even those schools have some

796
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,600
criteria that aren't in the data. So

797
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,919
like even those schools have like kids

798
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,320
of teachers

799
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,600
>> or sib No, no, that that that's sort of

800
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,519
not it's like kids of teachers siblings

801
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,080
like these priorities that that we don't

802
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,080
observe in the data.

803
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,240
Right. And then what I'm also going to

804
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,399
do and and again I think this assumes

805
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,240
away a lot of important things is for

806
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,159
the purposes of this work we're going to

807
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,399
assume that program quality metrics

808
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,039
capture preferences right our proxy for

809
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,960
metrics for for preferences right so the

810
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,279
um so things like selectivity graduation

811
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,360
rate college enrollment rate performance

812
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,880
impact in the paper we end up doing

813
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,720
things like safety and college and

814
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,120
career readiness and other things like

815
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,919
that as well

816
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,840
>> do you think geography at all

817
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,720
Yes. So, what we're going to end up

818
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,600
doing is we're going to compare where

819
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,720
could a student have matched compared to

820
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,880
where did they match um and where the

821
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,960
could have matched is restricted to be

822
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,039
no further away geographically than

823
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,840
where they actually matched. So, we're

824
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,440
going to take sort of um so yeah. So, so

825
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,440
we're going to think about like prito

826
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,600
dominance in terms of geography and sort

827
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,240
of these characteristics

828
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,760
um and

829
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,919
traditional things like things

830
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,519
getting some places are actually more

831
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,679
cumbersome than others.

832
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,080
>> Yeah.

833
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,559
>> Yes. Great question. And so like in the

834
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,240
first paper in the first paper where all

835
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,559
the analysis was on data we had on

836
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,519
Cornell like transfer to Cornell servers

837
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,960
the the most granular

838
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,440
geographic location we have for a

839
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,960
student is zip code which is imperfect

840
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,679
and um so and we use commute distance by

841
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,360
like zip code centers and sort of the

842
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,200
second piece interventional piece we've

843
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,159
been working with the public schools and

844
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,840
so on their servers we have we have

845
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,040
exact addresses which we convert to

846
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
census tracks

847
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,079
Um and sort of we use census track and

848
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,839
again everything is subway or like

849
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,839
commute distance. Yeah.

850
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,320
Okay.

851
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:29,200
And so um actually yeah let me just sort

852
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,520
of um summarize a little bit sort of the

853
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,639
empirical findings from the first paper.

854
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,639
So um what I'm going to so here again so

855
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,480
here I have different race or ethnic

856
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,919
ethnic groups on the y- axis I have

857
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,720
offer rate and in the different in in

858
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,879
the the sum of the bars it's sort of the

859
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,919
offer rate on average of the students

860
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,679
actual match right so like the average

861
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,639
Asian student matched to a school that

862
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,280
accepted about 50% of applicants

863
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,520
in the dark blue I have um their

864
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,400
counterfactual which is exactly what I

865
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,160
just said which is the best school

866
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
according to this metric that they could

867
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,760
have gotten into um that was no further

868
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,760
geographically by commute distance than

869
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,680
their actual match. And so for the

870
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,240
average Asian student, that's about 32.

871
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,200
And I'm just going to call um under

872
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,440
matching sort of this difference, right?

873
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,800
So where did they match versus

874
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,800
counterfactually where they could have

875
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,800
matched?

876
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,760
the fact that everyone

877
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:39,440
>> Yep. Okay. Great. No. No. So, so

878
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,520
>> um the first empirical paper um No. So,

879
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,480
this is like a one like like a one

880
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,760
change. Um in the second paper sort of

881
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,760
like the interventional piece that's

882
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,040
like the first order thing that we did

883
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,800
everything like sort of that that's like

884
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,200
this the core of the paper is you have

885
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,240
to deal with congestion that your

886
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,079
recommendations induce. Great.

887
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,839
So if there are better schools that are

888
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,040
closer, what like what information are

889
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,640
they or families do you think or like

890
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,160
it's just so

891
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,000
>> Yeah, I mean I I think there's just like

892
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,359
again like there's both true preference

893
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,440
stories and um sort of complex awareness

894
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,839
stories that you can tell sort of to

895
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,839
explain behavior.

896
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,320
Okay. And so then this is so this is

897
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,480
undermatching differences by race and

898
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,880
ethnicity. And sort of one thing to note

899
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,599
is the differences in where students

900
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,880
matched are on average much bigger than

901
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,680
sort of the differences between the

902
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,320
counterfactuals.

903
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,480
Right? So this is in this sense um sort

904
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,400
of um you know it's it's not I think not

905
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,880
a perfect comparison. I think mostly

906
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,760
because of this like equilibrium issue

907
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,520
in this plot um is sort of um if you

908
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,599
look at the individual student sort of

909
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,040
on average these are the differences in

910
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:59,359
selectivities and then um if you look at

911
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,880
sort of uh where they actually matched

912
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,599
and then the teal is if all you did was

913
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,520
resort a student's portfolio

914
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:12,000
according to offer rate right so um like

915
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,760
they had the school in their list. It

916
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,880
just wasn't it just wasn't before the

917
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,880
school that they actually matched to.

918
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,400
And then this is um I think for time

919
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,720
reasons maybe I won't get into it but

920
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,040
this is sort of basically the same plot

921
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,480
but now in a map of New York. Um

922
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,359
actually sorry I can always I can never

923
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,960
resist. Um like there's like if you know

924
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,599
New York there's like so many stories

925
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,440
you can tell from this point. like like

926
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,960
at this point over 5 years I've done a

927
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,119
lot of like empirical analys

928
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,040
quantitative analyses of inequities in

929
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,359
New York and every plot looks like this

930
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,839
right across papers. Um and so like one

931
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,520
one interesting thing is maybe so like

932
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,200
up here the northwest is Riverdale which

933
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,320
is actually a relatively wealthy

934
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,800
neighborhood um in New York City. Um but

935
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,280
sort of just to the south of Riverdale

936
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,079
is like Inwood, which is again um less

937
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,640
welloff and to the east of Riverdale is

938
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,640
the Bronx, which is also less welloff.

939
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,640
And if you look at Riverdale, if so on

940
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,560
the left plot, it's like the match offer

941
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,560
rate of student on average of students

942
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,800
there. And like on average, they're

943
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,960
getting into like, you know, schools

944
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,440
that accept 65 70%. Right? So like on

945
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,440
average students in Riverdale are sort

946
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,880
of getting into less selective schools

947
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,480
than maybe students in downtown

948
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,320
Manhattan,

949
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,079
right? But if you look at undermatching

950
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,200
is they're basically not undermatching

951
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,000
at all, right? They're basically getting

952
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,520
into the most selective schools that

953
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,040
geographically

954
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,359
they can get into. Right? So like

955
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,880
Riverdale is just far, right? It's like

956
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,520
really hard to get to anywhere from

957
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,440
Riverdale, right? So if you look at the

958
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,599
undermatching metric, they're actually

959
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,520
doing very well on the undermatching

960
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,040
metric, even if they're not doing so

961
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,040
well on the offer rate metric.

962
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,400
Okay?

963
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,599
And so then we might ask is where in a

964
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,560
student's list did is this undermatching

965
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,480
coming from, right? So is it so this is

966
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,640
another example. So this is a student

967
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,200
that was rejected from their first three

968
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,800
programs and then their fourth program

969
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,200
accepts everyone and that's where they

970
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:36,079
matched

971
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:39,040
right and what we show is if all we do

972
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:42,240
is analyses as a function of this list

973
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,720
very simple individual characteristics

974
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,880
um like functions of this that so I'll

975
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,200
show one example in the next slide

976
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,920
explain about 41% of the variance in

977
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,760
undermatching um Even though like

978
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,560
individual student characteristics, so

979
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,359
like race, ethnicity, grades, things

980
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,520
like that only explain about 4%. Right?

981
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,480
So like very simple functions of just

982
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,079
sort of looking at the portfolio

983
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,200
um explain under matching. So like as

984
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,240
one example, think about um you know a

985
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,640
student who doesn't what we say doesn't

986
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,000
apply to any reach program, right? So

987
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,280
their first program accepts even

988
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,079
historically basically 100% of its

989
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,040
applicants, right? So like if the first

990
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,200
program you apply to accepts 100% of its

991
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
applicants, it doesn't matter what the

992
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,240
rest of your list was because you'll

993
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,000
just never get there in deferred

994
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,880
acceptance,

995
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,560
right? And so this sort of behavior is

996
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,839
about um you know so here again I have

997
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,320
different bars for different race and

998
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,480
ethnicities and different colors for

999
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,400
eligible for free and reduced lunch or

1000
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:56,000
not. And so um the average Asian student

1001
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,720
sort of only about 5 to 7% of Asian

1002
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,400
students sort of have behavior like this

1003
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,359
where their first program accepts

1004
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,640
everyone and whereas this is about sort

1005
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,000
of either 17 or 25% of black students

1006
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,079
depending on if they're eligible for

1007
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,640
free and reduced lunch. Um and then

1008
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,560
similar patterns.

1009
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,800
Yeah. Um

1010
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,079
I I guess I'm I'm trying to understand

1011
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,599
why it would ever be a good strategy to

1012
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,800
select something that to like put

1013
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,480
something that's

1014
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,160
>> again like I I think like there's true

1015
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,760
preference reasons like people have true

1016
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,040
preferences to go

1017
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,680
>> to different schools.

1018
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,440
>> There's like

1019
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,119
there are cases in which someone might

1020
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,960
be like say geographically in a location

1021
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,680
where the only closest schools are those

1022
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,720
that are like

1023
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,800
>> Yeah. accepting. Okay.

1024
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,440
>> Yeah. So, so, so again like like again

1025
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,160
this is sort of I think like like

1026
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,440
anything any plot like this had like

1027
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,520
will not tell you anything about

1028
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,720
students true preferences or geographic

1029
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,280
constraints or so on right the these are

1030
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,680
very simplistic views

1031
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,960
>> like an associated question like you're

1032
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,640
making the assumption that the more

1033
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,920
selected school is inherently like

1034
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,079
better in terms of the rankings like you

1035
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,680
like maybe look at other variables such

1036
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,400
as like school performance or outcome

1037
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,839
Great. So like I so in in the so you

1038
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,920
know I don't want to use terms like

1039
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,760
better or worse. I in the in sort of in

1040
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,079
the paper we use a whole bunch of

1041
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,560
metrics that this school district uses.

1042
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,920
So like selectivity um performance

1043
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,839
impact um like you know some aggregate

1044
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,960
measure based on survey data including

1045
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,880
safety um graduation rate, college

1046
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,280
enrollment rate, you essentially get the

1047
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,200
same pattern regardless of what metric

1048
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,200
you use. Yeah.

1049
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,839
Okay.

1050
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:55,280
Um, great. And so, um, the last thing we

1051
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:56,400
did in this paper is, um,

1052
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,520
actually I'm going to skip this because

1053
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,640
I kind of want to get to the second

1054
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,880
paper. Okay. Okay, so we did some math

1055
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,800
and the upshot of the math is um we

1056
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,720
calculated the quote unquote optimal

1057
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,599
recommendation like the optimal feedback

1058
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,440
you would want to give to a student in

1059
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,240
order to most improve their outcomes and

1060
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,800
expectation. Trust me that we did that.

1061
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,520
Um and what did the model spit out? the

1062
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,319
model spit out that essentially like for

1063
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,839
most um black and Hispanic students, the

1064
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,680
sort of the optimal thing to do if

1065
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,680
you're optimizing for selectivity of the

1066
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,119
match is to apply to a much more

1067
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:37,200
selective program first. Whereas for

1068
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,720
Asian and white students, sort of the

1069
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,640
models recommendations are much more

1070
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,040
heterogeneous, right? Like many of them

1071
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,280
should be applying to more um

1072
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,800
competitive first programs, but many of

1073
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,839
them should maybe be applying to less

1074
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,319
competitive um second, third, fourth

1075
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,160
programs in order to even optimize their

1076
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,040
own selectivity.

1077
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,880
>> Also like the

1078
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,920
>> Yeah. Yeah. This is sort of like

1079
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,640
accounting for where they would have

1080
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,880
gotten in and so on,

1081
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,560
>> you know, that like you know that they

1082
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,040
like

1083
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,720
there may just not be schools nearby.

1084
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,720
>> Yeah. Yeah. So I I can talk about the

1085
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,400
details offline, but essentially Yes.

1086
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,760
Yeah.

1087
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,680
Okay. And so what do we do about this?

1088
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,319
This is sort of what's been we've been

1089
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,079
working on for the past few months u or

1090
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,839
I think six months at this point, six,

1091
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,480
seven months, which is working with New

1092
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:32,560
York City public schools um to to sort

1093
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,240
of um design nudges in order to nudge um

1094
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,400
students into applying to high

1095
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,640
performing schools. And I guess I like

1096
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,680
five minutes or so. So I'll try to give

1097
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,160
the punchlines. Um and so like how do we

1098
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,880
define high performing schools or sort

1099
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,800
of how do we per define um disadvantaged

1100
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,880
middle schools is we think about middle

1101
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,520
schools that consistently send very few

1102
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,599
students to high performing high schools

1103
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,520
despite having students who would have

1104
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,839
been admitted to those schools. And then

1105
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,359
high performing high school is defined

1106
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,839
by our partners in the New York City

1107
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,920
public schools. But it essentially is

1108
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,680
some combination of graduation rate,

1109
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,480
college and career readiness and safety

1110
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,000
scores.

1111
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,000
And then the question is is sort of

1112
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,480
should we like sort of like are these

1113
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,480
nudges effective?

1114
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,480
But then we run into exactly this

1115
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,280
problem of equilibrium effects, right?

1116
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,839
which is each program is capacity

1117
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,280
constrained and um suppose an applicant

1118
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,680
has a high chance of admissions

1119
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,640
according to the model that they see in

1120
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,680
the portal, right? And we nudge a whole

1121
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,920
bunch of high likelihood applicants to

1122
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,040
apply to a school.

1123
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,960
Well, then we're changing the

1124
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,280
application behavior according to the

1125
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,000
assumptions of the model. Right now

1126
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,599
we're doing an intervention in a on to

1127
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,560
change the data that the predictive

1128
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,800
model was assuming. And so then if you

1129
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,520
have too many nudges to the same program

1130
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,520
then that's going to be self-defeating,

1131
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,520
right? And so then the design goal of

1132
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,599
sort of the methods sort of sort of like

1133
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,480
the interesting methods of this piece is

1134
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,119
how do we nudge students so that even if

1135
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,280
some fraction of them were to follow the

1136
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,599
recommendations then they were still a

1137
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,680
good set of recommendations right that

1138
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,960
we're not just nudging everyone to apply

1139
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,640
to schools that then they're competing

1140
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,720
with each other and now they weren't a

1141
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,880
good set of recommendations in the first

1142
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:36,079
place.

1143
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,480
How we operationalize that in this work

1144
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,520
is um we're only going to be nudging

1145
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,040
high high likelihood applicants

1146
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,680
according to this of sort of this

1147
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,319
previous model and then we're going to

1148
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,480
say suppose a high likelihood applicant

1149
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,800
has some admissions probability at a

1150
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,800
program according to that model. We want

1151
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,520
to design nudges so that even if X

1152
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,160
percentage of applicants follow our

1153
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,200
nudges, so behave according to our

1154
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:09,040
nudge, then still Y percentage of them

1155
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,920
are admitted um in actuality and like

1156
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,960
what X and Y are are obviously design

1157
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,720
decisions that someone needs to make,

1158
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,839
right? But this is sort of the goal,

1159
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,119
right? So this is maybe one example um

1160
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:26,000
of sort of X going from like 0 to 40% or

1161
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,240
so and then Y sort of each line here is

1162
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
a different program

1163
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,480
right and we came we came to this

1164
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,280
through simulation like using previous

1165
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,720
year's data right so like in something

1166
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,880
like this if maybe somewhere you know if

1167
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:45,520
X is here then for this program that 95%

1168
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,960
sort of actually maybe go down to 65%.

1169
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,240
And that would be a bad thing.

1170
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,680
>> I guess like a question here is like you

1171
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,839
know you swap out high likelihood for

1172
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,520
like you know another type of target. I

1173
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,440
guess like one question is you kind of

1174
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,359
like already know the score function

1175
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,880
right of like you know absent capacity

1176
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,760
constraints if I were this school would

1177
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,839
I accept this app?

1178
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,520
>> Yeah but we know that

1179
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,880
>> uh would it be possible to like look at

1180
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,800
something like that as your benchmark

1181
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,000
instead where it's like sort of maximize

1182
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,960
the number of students who pass that

1183
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,280
that score.

1184
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,920
>> Yeah. So you you could do many things.

1185
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,839
Um the reason we went for this is this

1186
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,400
is partially a communication constraint

1187
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:22,319
is that students see the high likelihood

1188
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,040
right students know students are told

1189
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,040
whether they're high likelihood.

1190
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,440
>> Okay. And so we have essentially

1191
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,440
something that corresponds to coordinate

1192
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,920
descent in um sort of for a given set.

1193
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,920
So now we have an optimization problem

1194
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,400
where we want to figure out the maximum

1195
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,599
number of nudges we can send to a given

1196
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,440
school assuming some kind of applicant

1197
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,920
adoption right so let's just ahead of

1198
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,079
time assume let's say 40% you know it's

1199
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,280
the most successful RCT of all time that

1200
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,280
40% of people follow nudges

1201
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,200
>> oh

1202
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,200
>> oh so this year we're sending emails

1203
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,119
>> this year we're sending emails to the

1204
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,880
applicant's parent to say sort of can

1205
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,359
here is a high performing high school

1206
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,240
near where you live that sort of you

1207
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:18,640
have high admissions likelihood too.

1208
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,400
>> One could imagine another nudge would be

1209
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,880
they fill out an additional list.

1210
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,480
>> Yeah.

1211
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,079
>> Yeah. Yeah. So we we thought about many

1212
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,319
potential designs sort of some of them

1213
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,200
we're hoping to do next year. this year

1214
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:33,599
sort of um you know software and various

1215
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,359
constraints that this year it's the

1216
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,880
simplest possible thing is it's an email

1217
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:42,240
to students or to to their parents um

1218
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:45,599
saying sort of here's a high school.

1219
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,920
>> Yeah. Um you could do multiple as well.

1220
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,400
Yeah.

1221
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,240
>> Are you doing ranking amongst those?

1222
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,559
>> No, we're just ordering I forget. I

1223
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,559
think maybe random.

1224
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,599
No, we're not doing anything like we're

1225
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,240
just like listing potentially multiple

1226
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,040
high school programs in some order.

1227
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,760
Yeah. Yeah. So, this is just an email

1228
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,760
and then they have to

1229
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,119
>> Yeah. Yeah. This is certainly not the

1230
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,680
perfect nudge. This is like a a year one

1231
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,240
pilot and so we're hoping to sort of do

1232
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:19,359
all of those in future years,

1233
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,680
but yes. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I

1234
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:24,480
mean I think there are reasons to

1235
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,720
believe that this year's nudges will be

1236
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,960
>> not the most effective RCT in the

1237
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,680
history of humanity.

1238
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,400
>> Um yeah.

1239
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,920
Um okay, great. So assume some kind of

1240
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,280
applicant adoption. Then here again we

1241
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,640
take advantage of the fact that we can

1242
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,319
perfectly simulate the system. Um assume

1243
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,480
adoption. So you change their

1244
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:49,200
preferences from last year's data. run

1245
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,040
deferred acceptance and just evaluate

1246
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,680
acceptance probabilities among students

1247
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,000
you told were a high likelihood. Rinse

1248
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,480
and repeat um while you iteratively

1249
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,400
adjust adjust these nudge caps until

1250
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,040
you're happy, right? And so we ended up

1251
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,040
with something like this.

1252
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,599
Um once you have these nudge caps,

1253
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,720
another integer program that actually

1254
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,359
sort of then does the nudges in that

1255
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,400
sort of now you have constraints for how

1256
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,000
many nudges you can send per school and

1257
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,640
you want to decide am I going to nudge

1258
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,079
this student to this school. And so for

1259
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,599
each student you have the list of high

1260
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,119
performing high schools that are within

1261
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,640
45 minutes of their home um census tract

1262
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,160
and they have high admissions likelihood

1263
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:39,280
at two. um run an integer program this

1264
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:42,000
year again some heristic which is um

1265
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,480
sort of um you want to maximize the

1266
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,400
number of nudges but maybe not the sum

1267
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,400
because that could be unfair and so

1268
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,640
maybe you want to sort of encode some

1269
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,119
notion of diminishing utility that you

1270
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,760
would rather give one nudge to someone

1271
00:51:53,119 --> 00:52:00,200
than a third nudge to someone else right

1272
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,200
and so this kind of encodes that

1273
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,599
um I'm running out of time and so maybe

1274
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,480
I can end

1275
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,359
So this is um an active RCT we launched

1276
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,720
in October um when the application cycle

1277
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,079
started um it closes in December. Um,

1278
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,319
and this was just like an incredible

1279
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,160
amount of work by Erica, um, the lead

1280
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,559
PhD student on this project over like

1281
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,160
the last sort of like I mean really

1282
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,400
started working on it in January, but

1283
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,720
sort of since like May or June has been

1284
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,280
embedded full-time um, and sort of in

1285
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,960
the New York City public schools um, and

1286
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,000
sort of like working across multiple

1287
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,160
offices to like define high performing

1288
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,920
um, schools and then have focus groups

1289
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,839
and then we have to have translations

1290
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,079
and communicate with superintendent and

1291
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:44,000
middle schools and do all the RCT

1292
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,680
infrastructure and sort of like make

1293
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,280
sure the data science is correct. So

1294
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,200
just like an incredible amount of work

1295
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,720
and you know hopefully you know ask me

1296
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,880
about the results in the spring

1297
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,839
and I'll maybe end here. Um I think

1298
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,559
there's like a whole bunch of

1299
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,480
interesting uh methods questions as well

1300
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,440
sort of in on especially and this is

1301
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,520
what I'm really excited about

1302
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,680
methodologically on like how do we think

1303
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,920
about what makes a good recommendation

1304
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,920
um in equilibrium right so like when you

1305
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,520
have to think about these externalities

1306
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,520
um both for this student and other

1307
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,760
students um when you're sending many of

1308
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,200
them

1309
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,200
cool I'll stop
