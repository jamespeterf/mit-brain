1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,120
thank you thank you very much for for

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,679
your very kind introduction it's a a

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,679
tremendous pleasure to to be here today

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,559
to tell you a little bit more about what

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,160
we do at the Microsystems technology

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,080
Laboratories and how we collaborate not

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,560
only with lots of people on campus but

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,760
with hundreds of of different companies

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,359
worldwide to to make an impact in Micro

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,560
Systems and micro Electronics because

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,200
that that's our our mission Mt for short

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,879
is the home of Microsystems research and

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,239
education at MIT and our definition of

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,960
of Microsystems is very broad going all

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,440
the way from Innovations in materials to

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,600
to systems microelectronics

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,640
nanotechnology electronic and photonic

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,760
devices sensors bioms integrated

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,239
circuits all the way to system level

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,320
prototyping so very very Broad very

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,600
broad mission for a a very important

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,560
impact that we think we we are playing

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,159
because we all know that

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,640
microelectronics has enabled many

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,320
different revolutions o over the last 75

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,799
years it's because of micro electronics

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,960
that the computer Revolution happened

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,479
it's because of micro electronics that

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,000
the communication Revolution happened it

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,560
is because of microelectronics that the

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,680
internet and the AI Revolution

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,439
are happening today but even though

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
microelectronics and semiconductors and

34
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,000
new materials and technologies have been

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,399
transforming our society for the last

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,920
few decades I would like to to argue

37
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,079
that we are just starting to scratch the

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,320
surface of the true potential of

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,799
Microsystems and that's exactly where

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,200
MTL comes into

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,159
place so we are just starting the the

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
scratch the surface how how can that be

43
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,759
I mean we are already making an impact

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,119
in in in Computing we are making an

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,680
impact in Communications we are making a

46
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,560
the internet and AI possible but at the

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,280
same

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,800
time microelectronics I I would argue it

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,760
is the absolutely critical missing piece

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,879
today to enable personalize affordable

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,480
health care that can provide better

52
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,360
outcomes if we are able to bring more

53
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,680
sense

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,400
more intelligence to the devices around

55
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,599
us I have no

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,680
idea I I have no doubt

57
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:45,040
that we are going to start a revolution

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,040
in healthcare not not only

59
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,000
there microelectronics is also key for

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,480
feeding the wall again if we are able to

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,040
bring more intelligence to agriculture

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,680
more intelligence for the to the food

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,400
production ER Network in in our world I

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,799
have no doubt that we will be able to

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,599
increase efficiency and really

66
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,440
significantly transform our society yes

67
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,799
in the same way we have transformed

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,280
Society for the last 75 years through

69
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:21,280
Computing communication the internet AI

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,000
Etc also there is no green energy

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,760
without micro Electronics without

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,920
semiconductors and without chips there

73
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,840
are no electric vehicles there are no

74
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,840
renewable energy resources that there is

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,400
in summary no no green

76
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,080
energy and when we look at the AI

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Revolution and what is enabling the AI

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,840
Revolution it's all the the AI data

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,560
centers that

80
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,799
are coming up all throughout our

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,799
geography and AI it's right in the way

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,159
of the exponential Improvement in

83
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,159
performance that microelectronics

84
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,280
semiconductors and materials have

85
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,400
enabled for many many

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,879
decades so microelectronics has

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,760
transformed our world and it's in a path

88
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,319
to continue to create new new

89
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,400
revolutions at the same time I would

90
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,440
argue that microelectronics also

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,759
represents one of the most important

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,080
risks for our society and and that that

93
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,440
is highlighted in in this plot here

94
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,560
which shows energy consumption as well

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,280
as energy production as a a function of

96
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,880
time ER in green we we

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,440
have the the energy consumption by micro

98
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,240
electronics and semiconductors as a

99
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,160
function of of time while in Orange we

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,240
we have the walls energy production and

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,320
as we see it the amount of energy that

102
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,440
goes into Electronics is increasing

103
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,880
exponentially and if the current trains

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,400
continue roughly by

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:05,600
2035 or 2040 my micro electronics and AI

106
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,479
data centers and semiconductor based

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,400
communication systems are going to be

108
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,919
using 100% of all the energy being

109
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,000
produced in the world no energy for food

110
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,400
production no energy for transportation

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,600
no energy for anything else than

112
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,160
microelectronics and that's of course a

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,680
problem and that that's also a huge

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,919
opportunity for all of us so that's

115
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,960
where

116
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,440
MTL is playing a very important role in

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,759
the MIT ecosystem our mission is really

118
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,400
to develop the next generation of

119
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,199
materials devices systems and

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,840
microelectronic prototypes in very close

121
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,840
collaboration with our industry industry

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,240
colleagues we are an inter departmental

123
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,240
Laboratory spanning more than seven

124
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:11,319
different departments and approximately

125
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,319
70 different research groups across

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,360
MIT and when I think when I step back

127
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,479
and think okay what what are the the key

128
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,039
the key enablers that have made MTL

129
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,720
successful I I I would summarize them as

130
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:30,280
follows first of all the very very

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,440
strong Community if you ask anyone a at

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,599
MIT about the different communities that

133
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:40,599
the different labs and initiatives have

134
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:44,479
everyone will highlight MTL as one of

135
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:46,759
the strongest communities on campus and

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,080
again the community is not only the

137
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,639
professors and the students it's also

138
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,520
the staff and

139
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,199
especially our industry industry

140
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,720
Partners we have a full commitment to

141
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,599
Excellence like everyone else a ad MIT

142
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,440
and all the different departments that

143
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:09,400
are essential for the future of

144
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,120
Microsystems are very well ranked

145
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,479
internationally and we take full

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,919
advantage of

147
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:19,440
that we also thrive in inter

148
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,720
disciplinary research and because we are

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,120
a fairly large Department touching lots

150
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,599
of things all the way from sensors for

151
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,000
food production to health care and the

152
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,039
future of compute we divide ourselves in

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
smaller interdisciplinary research

154
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,120
communities and here we have a few of

155
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,680
them such as the the center for

156
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,879
integrated circuits and systems doing

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,280
everything related to chips and chiplets

158
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,120
or on medical electronic devices and

159
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,400
realization Center the

160
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,720
medc AI the AI is Transforming Our wall

161
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,400
at many different levels and MTL faculty

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,440
members are working together in the MIT

163
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,960
AI Hardware program to make that happen

164
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,360
for Power Electronics white bang of

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,680
semiconductors are extremely important

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,960
components and again there is a a an

167
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:17,039
initiative on that as there is one on 2D

168
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:20,919
materials as applied to energy Ai and

169
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,360
compute and we are not stopping there

170
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,639
there are new programs being started all

171
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
the time and right now we are working

172
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,199
with with our community to get two

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,560
additional initiatives started

174
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:38,440
one on the future of display technology

175
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,640
both large area displays as well as AR

176
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,600
VR displays and there is another

177
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,920
initiative being started as we speak

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,760
right now

179
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:54,240
today at MTL on the use of

180
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,240
semiconductors to revolutionize

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,560
Healthcare we are also very fortunate to

182
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,000
have access to to worldclass

183
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,160
experimental facil facilities such as

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,920
MIT Nano the Lisa tissue building here

185
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:13,079
at MIT which is the the State ofthe art

186
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,760
probably the world best microelectronics

187
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,600
prototyping facility and if you haven't

188
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,800
had a chance to to visit it h please do

189
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,240
because it's a really really impressive

190
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,200
place where you can see a research

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,880
happening 24/7 and I believe there are

192
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,399
tours organized for for this after

193
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,399
for those

194
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,440
interested we thrive in Innovation and

195
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,600
we thrive on entrepreneurship and new

196
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,839
startups in in this field come out of

197
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,720
MTL all the time and here we have a a a

198
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,000
few of the ones who have come out of MTL

199
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
in in the last few

200
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:00,079
years and last but not least we are

201
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,839
extremely proud of our very vibrant

202
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,800
industrial consorti or or me the

203
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,519
Microsystems industrial group that is

204
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,480
made of 16 amazing companies that are

205
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,279
supporting our work ER throughout many

206
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,920
many decades I'm

207
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:23,120
sorry and this work as I mentioned spans

208
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:28,360
all the way from basic material ER

209
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:31,800
research a AI driven material Discovery

210
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,959
all the way to new semiconductor devices

211
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,000
and sensors putting them together into

212
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,120
more complex chips changing the factor

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,519
of electronics Electronics doesn't have

214
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,399
to be rigid like today's computers

215
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,920
Electronics is going to be flexible it's

216
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:53,720
going to be transparent it's going to be

217
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,399
invisible and we spend a lot of time

218
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,399
prototyping actual systems all the way

219
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:05,200
from Smart fabrics and textiles

220
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:10,839
to insect scale micro robots new

221
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,839
biomedical H devices and systems etc

222
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,519
etc and we don't stop at the prototyping

223
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,320
we also spend a lot of time thinking

224
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,519
very carefully

225
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,320
about entrepreneurship and the supply

226
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,240
chain that is necessary to take all

227
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,120
these Innovations from the lab to the

228
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,720
market and I would love to work with

229
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
with with all of you on

230
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,279
this so we organize lots of different

231
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,160
events and activities throughout the

232
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,639
year and I I don't have a a time today

233
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,720
to to go through through all of them but

234
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,959
I I do want to highlight a a couple of

235
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,920
of initiatives such as our annual

236
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,720
conference the Microsystems annual

237
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,639
research conference or or mark this is

238
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,160
the the

239
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,600
largest university organized micro

240
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,839
electronics and micro systems conference

241
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,920
anywhere in the world it happens EV

242
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:10,480
every every January in a a wonderful ski

243
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:14,480
resort a couple of hours North of Boston

244
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I I invite all of you to to

245
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,440
attend we also have a a a a a very

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,639
Lively career fair happening every every

247
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,760
September where hundreds of of of

248
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,760
students and companies take take part

249
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:36,440
a a a very Dynamic and active resume

250
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,399
site and also I I do want to spend a a

251
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,279
minute or so on this a program which

252
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:45,720
goes beyond M micro micro Electronics

253
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:50,440
you know a a few years ago I I asked MIT

254
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:54,560
students hey we all know that Hardware

255
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:58,120
is the future we all enjoy playing with

256
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,399
hardware and with the breakthroughs that

257
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,440
Hardware enables but if that if that is

258
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,639
the case how is that many of you are are

259
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,720
actually going into software and what

260
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,240
the MIT students told me freshman and

261
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,720
sophomore was you know what when we

262
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,680
first joined MIT we were super excited

263
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,920
about Hardware everything from

264
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,800
microelectronics to robots to everything

265
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:27,240
in between but then as first year and

266
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,839
sophomore we appli to summer internships

267
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,199
to Hardware focused companies

268
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,800
and we got rejected from every single

269
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,680
hardware company while we were getting

270
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,440
amazing internships in

271
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,560
software companies and that is a problem

272
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,839
we are closing the pipeline right at the

273
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,360
beginning and we started this program

274
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,160
the Northeast micro Electronics

275
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,000
internship program to to change that to

276
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,720
provide summer internships to first year

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,560
and second year students throughout the

278
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Northeast in Hardware Focus companies

279
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,079
this year we have more than 450 students

280
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,680
interested in Hardware focused jobs in

281
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,600
industry and I need your help I need you

282
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,519
to reach out to us and provide

283
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,759
opportunities for for for the next

284
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:16,560
generation of Technology

285
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,399
leaders and I'm running out of time but

286
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,680
I I do want to to finish by by

287
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,680
highlighting that this year we celebrate

288

the 40th anniversary of the Microsystems

289
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,480
technology laboratory and for many

290
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,680
decades we have had a very close

291
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,680
partnership with I

292
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,720
LP in everything related to hardware and

293
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,680
microelectronics and we are exercising

294
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,120
this partnership this year by organizing

295
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:46,000
