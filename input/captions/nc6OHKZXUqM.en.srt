1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
Yeah, you're going to hear about some

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,359
cool tech today and that's not

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,600
surprising. I mean, this is the

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,480
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,200
but uh I want to take a broader look at

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,799
the theme of connection, connectivity,

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,480
and in order to do that, I'm going to go

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,760
back a little ways to go forward. So,

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
I'm going to talk about some history,

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,720
but with luck, this will also give us

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,160
some insights about the future. So,

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
yeah, I started in 1975.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,279
I've been here a long time.

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
Uh that was a couple of years after uh

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,600
Vince Surf and Bob Khan proposed what

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,320
the internet might be and they convened

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
a group the network working group.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,800
We had to figure out how to actually

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120
build it. We wrote code. I chaired that

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,920
group in the 1980s.

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,600
Um in the 1990s I worked on well I'll

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,280
tell you about the 1990s when I get

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
there. But since this is about

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
connectivity um what were we connecting

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,239
in the 1970s? We thought we were hooking

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,440
up time sharing mainframes, huge

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,960
machines. They filled a room right now.

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
We sort of knew about personal

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,240
computers. Xerox Park had the Alto and

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,159
we saw Ethernet out there, but we

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
where's that? What's going to happen?

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,479
Um,

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,159
in the 1980s, it was clear we were

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,680
hooking up everything. The IBM PC

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,759
happened and we realized everybody was

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,200
going to own one and all of a sudden we

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,880
weren't hooking up hundreds of thousands

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
of machines. We were hooking up hundreds

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,080
of millions of machines. So basically

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,759
the 1980s was a scale up decade. We had

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,280
to scale up routing. We had to scale up

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,560
addressing. Um in fact it was 1991 we

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,479
had a big workshop where we realized we

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,400
had to have a bigger address base. And

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,720
so that's what got us to IPv6 which

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,439
we're still working on 40 years later.

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,799
No, no, no, no, no. But but we could see

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,479
the trajectory of connectivity and and

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
the important insight that you should

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,280
have in this case, which I would say is

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,680
that applications always stalk capacity.

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,960
I have to remind you we were doing voice

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,640
over the internet in the 1970s.

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Okay. Now, we had to really compress it

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,560
down to [laughter] like two kilobits

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,760
because the backbone of the arponet at

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
the time was a 50 kilobit circuit,

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
right? Nobody said, "Did you say

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
megabits?" No, no, I said kilobits,

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,319
right? Um, oh, the first generation of

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,200
the NSF nut showed up. My god, it was a

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,120
megabit and a half. Oh, we did video

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
teleconferencing.

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
worked really well, but you could only

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
do it to a campus because that's the

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,599
only place you had that capacity. And so

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,920
we we basically got up to the point in

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,000
the early 90s where all of a sudden a

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,480
whole bunch of things became clear and I

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
might describe them as sort of negative

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,680
epiphies. Um

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,319
I I will tell you a couple of stories

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,560
which are sort of wonderful. Um,

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
everybody saw we needed more capacity to

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,159
the home.

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,599
Dialup modems 9.6 kilobits. No, no, no,

77
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,519
no, no, no, no. We needed more capacity.

78
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,920
And there was an National Research

79
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,440
Council study called Realizing the

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,560
Information Future. I wrote a fair

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,239
amount of it and it was written in 1994.

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,280
And then we do some industry briefings.

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,800
We get a room like this.

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,440
the telephone people would not be in a

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,920
room with the cable people. He said,

86
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,920
"They're disgusting."

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,239
So, we briefed the telephone people one

88
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,519
day and we briefed the cable people the

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,040
next day. Now, in fact, there've been

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,239
both telephone and cable people on the

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480
committee. They managed to [snorts] get

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
them to talk to each other, stay in the

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,000
same room. And it was really interesting

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,239
to listen to those two people because we

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,480
talked to the telephone people and these

96
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,519
were sort of the regional carriers, you

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,239
know, and they said, "We don't no, we're

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,280
not going to do broadband to the home.

99
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,159
It's not in our business interest.

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,680
We don't think we can make money.

101
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
The only way you'll get it done is if

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,519
the regulators tell us we have to." I

103
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,319
said, "Oh, that's right. You still think

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,280
you're in a regulated industry where the

105
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,879
government's going to tell you what to

106
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,080
do? Oh, yeah. Right. Next day, we get

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,560
the cable guys in there and they're

108
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,160
cowboys. They're entrepreneurs.

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,919
And they said, "Oh, we have a 10-year

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,280
plan.

111
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,360
Don't tell the telephone company.

112
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,199
They think we're clowns. They wouldn't

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,440
even be in the same room with us. Here's

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
a here's a cable company joke. How can

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,240
you How do you become the vice president

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
of engineering in a cable company?

117
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
you stay sober enough so you don't fall

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
off the pole. Um

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
that's that you know lawyers tell lawyer

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,400
jokes, cable guys tell cable jokes. Um

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,160
but they say here's the 10-year plan.

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,160
We're going to start selling internet

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
because we have broadband because we

124
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
have enough capacity in the cable to do

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
it. And yeah, it may not be completely

126
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
stable in the sense that you'd like your

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
phone system to be stable. We're

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,160
upgrading our engineering. We're

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
upgrading everything. And we'll get the

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,680
consumer accustomed to the idea that

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,440
they can get multiple services over

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
cable. And then when we get the system

133
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,199
stable and our engineering up, then

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,639
we're going to start selling telefan

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,759
over the cable and they'll never see us

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,000
coming and we're going to take them from

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,479
behind and kill them.

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,360
And they did.

139
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,280
But they saw the business opportunity.

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,160
And and I said, "Oh,

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,520
it's all about money, isn't it? And the

142
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,360
tech follows where the money goes."

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
There was a visionary at Xerox Park. You

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
know, they did the Xerox Alto and all

145
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,280
this kind of thing. Allan K and he said

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,000
the best way to predict the future is to

147
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,520
invent it.

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,880
Allan

149
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,440
best way to predict the future is to

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,680
figure out who's investing in it. I I

151
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,759
had an economist conversation in about

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,639
1995.

153
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,080
Uh guy who knew a lot about the

154
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
economics of the internet and he said,

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,759
"David,

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,800
the internet is about money routing.

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,320
packet routing is a side effect and you

158
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
screwed up the money routing protocols.

159
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,039
That wasn't the word he used. And and I

160
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,360
said, I didn't design any money routing

161
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
protocols. And he said, that's what I

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,600
said.

163
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,319
So I hired an economist.

164
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,960
And I sort of was trying to understand

165
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,039
how to think about this

166
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,039
the the centrality of money.

167
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,960
Yeah, we were government funded guys

168
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
building something in the 1980s and

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
yeah, we knew it was going to get

170
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,680
commercialized. We had no idea how to

171
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,759
think about it.

172
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,919
But but the next interesting phase here

173
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,120
was about it was about this was in the

174
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,960
19 about the year 2000. Intel had a

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,479
negative epiphany.

176
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,280
Intel figured out that in order to keep

177
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
selling chips,

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,520
the computers had to get bigger and

179
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,120
faster and cooler and more fun.

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,654
And that wasn't happening in business

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,560
because people were just running.

182
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:57,520
[laughter] They were running, you know,

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,440
you know, Excel.

184
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
It was the gamers that were buying the

185
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
high and they were in the home. So they

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
needed broadband to the home so they

187
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,639
could sell more chips so they didn't go

188
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,720
out of business. I said, "Okay." And

189
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,479
they actually came to Washington. This

190
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,479
is Intel hates regulation. Came to

191
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,360
Washington to see if maybe they could

192
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,280
get the government to push for the

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,160
deployment of broadband to the home. so

194
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,840
they could sell more chips. Okay.

195
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,080
And at the time the cable guys were

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,599
executing their plan and there were at

197
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,120
that point there were all these little

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
tiny

199
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,880
dialup

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,120
uh modem people. You know you get dialup

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,039
service from your guy has a modem bank

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,440
in his garage. There was a industry

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,840
representative and he she said to me

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
there 8,000 of these little companies.

205
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
How are you going to protect them? I

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,080
said protect them. They're all going to

207
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,680
go out of business

208
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,120
because it's all going to be facilities.

209
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
It's going to be the cable guys against

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
the telephone companies. If you don't

211
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
own the wires to the home, you're out of

212
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,440
business. And they said, "What?" They

213
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,319
thought that was unfair. Okay.

214
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,800
But there was still a business problem.

215
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
Uh the cable guys actually had an

216
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,599
infrastructure that was really good for

217
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,039
connectivity because you could invest

218
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,919
incrementally and get incrementally

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,560
better service. With copper pairs, they

220
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,879
just suck. So you have to overbuild

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,879
yourself from scratch with fiber. So

222
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,599
it's this massive investment and I was

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,919
talking to guy in Verizon early on in

224
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,000
the in the 2000s and he they decided to

225
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
do FiOS you know fiber of the home and I

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
said what's the business model he said I

227
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,199
have no idea

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,599
but I'll tell you the business model if

229
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,360
I don't do it in five years we're out of

230
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,279
business so we're gambling I said huh

231
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,880
okay so I I sort of said okay it's

232
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,880
really it's really if you want to

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,120
understand connectivity you got to

234
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
understand money.

235
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,640
Okay, that's fine. I already hired an

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,839
economist. So,

237
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm actually a bit of an optimist about

238
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
connectivity in the to the home.

239
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,080
Actually, I'll tell you, uh we're going

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,720
through a gigantic investment phase now

241
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,240
where we are putting fiber in

242
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,640
everywhere, but fiber will last a long

243
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
time once we put it in. And I'll tell

244
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,560
you a little bit of an experience I had.

245
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,839
I'm on a on the board of an organization

246
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,360
called the Massachusetts Broadband

247
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,760
Institute, which was set up. It's a

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,839
public private corporation set up to get

249
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,839
connectivity into western Massachusetts,

250
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,120
which is very rural. It's not like

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,440
Montana, but it's very rural.

252
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,080
And we now have broadband in I think all

253
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,399
but two towns. Uh those towns are

254
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,160
particularly stubborn, and I don't know

255
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,160
what to do about them. But

256
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,720
is it a tech problem? No, it's not a

257
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,760
tech problem. We know exactly how to do

258
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,600
it. Okay.

259
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,240
Is it a cost problem? Well, broadband in

260
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,640
rural areas is going to cost more than

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,120
it is in downtown Boston. And I was

262
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,839
talking to guy out in western

263
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,440
Massachusetts. He said, "Grumbble,

264
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,720
grumble, grumble. Broadband cost more.

265
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
Grumble grumble grumble." And I said,

266
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,839
"When you drive into town to go to the

267
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,200
grocery store, how much does it cost you

268
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,279
to park?" And he said, "Cost?"

269
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,160
I said, "I go into Boston, it cost me

270
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,600
$40 a day to park." And he said, "Huh?

271
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
I said, "Two days I've bought your

272
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,040
broadband.

273
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
There's some things that are cheaper

274
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
like parking and there's some things

275
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,279
that are more expensive like broadband.

276
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,959
What's the problem?" Actually, the

277
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,560
problem is rural poverty. It's not cost.

278
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,640
So, what is the problem? Well, the

279
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,279
United States went down a connectivity.

280
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,440
We made an article of faith that we

281
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,680
didn't have to regulate

282
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,160
broadband connectivity because we had

283
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,839
competition between two companies, cable

284
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,240
companies and phone companies. Okay? In

285
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,800
the rural area, there is no facilities

286
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,399
competition. Nobody can afford to do it

287
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
more than once. So, all of a sudden,

288
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,399
we're going to have a dominant incumbent

289
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,079
and we've forgotten how to regulate

290
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
them.

291
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,880
Now, there's a town out there,

292
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,519
Stannisfield. I spent quite a bit of

293
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
time out there.

294
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,200
They want to build out broadband in

295
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,240
their town. 1,600 people and it's big

296
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,079
enough. They have two fire stations.

297
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,399
They don't have a regulator who can

298
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,800
regulate price regulate their internet

299
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,880
provider. Who's going to do this? We had

300
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,279
to solve the money problem, the

301
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,519
regulatory problem, and all the rest

302
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,680
comes. Okay. And by the way, let me tell

303
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,120
you how to screw up in rural

304
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,560
connectivity, which is you lose you. I

305
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,920
don't know how to do price regulation. I

306
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,320
don't know how to. So they say, we're

307
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,600
going to we're going to let out a

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
contract to let somebody come in and

309
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,120
build the area. And what we're going to

310
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,399
do is we're going to ask them to tell us

311
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
what the retail product is going to

312
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
cost. And the person that says they can

313
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
give the retail product for the lowest

314
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,839
cost, we'll get the bid. And so

315
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,720
everybody tries to low bid it. So, they

316
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,240
get in and then they get in there and

317
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,920
they say, "Oh, I'm not quite making any

318
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
money. I didn't qu That bid was a little

319
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,440
too low." And they come back and say, "I

320
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,279
need to raise that price." No, you can't

321
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
raise the price. If you raise the price,

322
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,360
the other guy might have won. You have

323
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
to. And then they go out of business.

324
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,880
That's called the world's stupidest way

325
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
to do price regulation. The price, the

326
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,079
price, the regulator has to be able to

327
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,760
change the price. And I said, "Okay,

328
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,320
it's about money, isn't it? It's not

329
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,079
about the tech." I was uh up in Maine.

330
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,760
There's a little a little

331
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,040
place on the coast we rent for a week

332
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,120
and a year ago I was in there and I did

333
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,959
a speed test and it was 3 megabits in

334
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
each direction. That's crappy DSL from

335
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,079
the local phone company. I went in and

336
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,959
just for the fun of it I did a speed

337
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,959
test and my god it was 120 megabits

338
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,240
birectional.

339
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,440
I couldn't believe what happened. I went

340
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
running outside to look at the back of

341
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,120
the house because there was fiber on the

342
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,320
house. There's a small company that's

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
running fiber into rural Maine. This

344
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,639
part of rural Maine around Bath. It's

345
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,839
not terribly rural. And they have fiber

346
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,440
to the home half mile off the road. Many

347
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,519
poles.

348
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,519
Okay. I don't know what the business

349
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,760
deal was, but the point is that's where

350
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,440
we are now. And once we've done it'll be

351
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,279
there for 30, 40, 50 years. So, so I'm

352
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,680
uh I'm actually somewhat optimistic

353
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,519
about connectivity at that level. And

354
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,800
we're seeing it overseas. Although when

355
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,040
you go into other parts of the world,

356
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,160
obviously they're behind the curve. But

357
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,160
I will say, by the way,

358
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,320
is wireless the great white hope? No,

359
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,959
not in western Massachusetts because the

360
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
terrain goes like this. So you put the

361
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,519
tower up there, you can't get down here,

362
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
you put the tower down here, you can't

363
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
get anywhere. Towns that went for

364
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,800
wireless discovered they got like 70%

365
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,600
coverage and the company went out of

366
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,440
business. So just spend the money. By

367
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,279
the way, notice all kinds of federal

368
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,519
subsidies now for building out

369
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,880
connectivity in rural areas, but they're

370
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,800
only paying for the initial capital

371
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,800
expenditure. You got to cover the

372
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,160
operating expense.

373
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,519
And wireless has a much higher opex

374
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,399
because you have to continue to refresh

375
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,160
the tech. So, let's actually switch for

376
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,120
a minute. Oh, and by the way, low Earth

377
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,720
orbit satellites are really cool,

378
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
but only use them when nothing else

379
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
works because otherwise they don't have

380
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,199
enough capacity. But that guy at the end

381
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
of the five mile driveway out in rural

382
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,680
Massachusetts, just yeah, give him a

383
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
satellite dish. You know, don't run

384
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,079
fibers five miles up his driveway unless

385
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,800
he wants to pay $25,000.

386
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,199
Actually, no, it's not that. It's about

387
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,040
20,000 a mile to construct fibers. So,

388
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,560
five mile driveway. Well, I was joking

389
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,360
about the five mile driveway, but that'd

390
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,399
be $100,000. So, don't do that. Okay?

391
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Give him a satellite dish. Um um let me

392
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,920
let me switch topics for a minute and I

393
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,839
do want to talk about wireless because

394
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,320
what's happened in the cellular space is

395
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,079
something we did not anticipate at all.

396
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,199
This this is truly amazing. Okay,

397
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,040
everybody's carrying one. Yeah, look on

398
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,880
the subway. Every single person is just

399
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,199
sitting there staring at us like this.

400
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,360
But but this is a transformative device.

401
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,760
And what's interesting since we're all

402
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,440
talking about money here is almost every

403
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,800
innovation comes with its own hype

404
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
bubble. You know, we're in the middle of

405
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,199
the AI hype bubble now and and we're

406
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
waiting to see when it bursts and yeah,

407
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,399
I'm an optimist about AI, but the curve

408
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,199
always goes like this. But there wasn't

409
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,880
even a bubble, but it just happened. But

410
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,040
the wireless industry and the buildout

411
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,279
in the wireless industry is quite

412
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,959
amazing. But there's an interesting

413
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:31,040
question. Why all those G's,

414
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:34,000
3G, 4G, 5G, and now we have 5G? They're

415
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,839
talking about 6G. And I was talking to a

416
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,839
cellular guy and he said,

417
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:47,079
"Unprintable, unprintable, unprintable."

418
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,079
And he said, "The G's are a conspiracy

419
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,920
by the equipment makers to make sure

420
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,160
that every 10 years we have to replace

421
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,480
all our equipment because you got to

422
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
have the new G." And I said, "Is 6G

423
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,440
going to be better than 5G?" I don't

424
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,399
know, but I'm going to have to pay for

425
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,720
it and they're going to sell it to me

426
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,360
and they're cramming it down my throat.

427
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,240
So cut out the with the G's, please. You

428
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,120
know, 5G is good enough. Oh, oh, future

429
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,440
blah blah blah. Just cool it, man. Cool

430
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,759
it. And you know, this is actually true.

431
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,360
Um,

432
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,720
I said that apps stock capacity. And we

433
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,959
knew we could do video over the

434
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
internet. We knew it in the 1980s. We

435
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,560
did audio over the internet in the

436
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,639
1970s. We're just waiting for the

437
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,160
capacity to get up.

438
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,320
So, here's an interesting policy

439
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,720
question. It's not about connectivity in

440
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,680
the sense you do, you don't have it. How

441
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,600
much is enough?

442
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,519
100 megabits,

443
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,600
500 megabits, a gigabit, 10 gigabits.

444
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:53,040
Okay, who said 10 gigabits? Um, you

445
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,199
don't need it. Now when we fantasized

446
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,959
about the applications we saw well

447
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,720
audio

448
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,160
spoken audio has a certain you want to

449
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,680
do music it's got to be high fidelity

450
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,400
it's got to be bigger you have v video

451
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,280
it gets bigger

452
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,679
if there's an application that is

453
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,760
driving that is waiting for capacity

454
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,640
what's beyond video well one answer is

455
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,319
one multi-person immersive augmented

456
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
reality or virtual reality and you can

457
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,640
say okay How much bandwidth do we need

458
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,880
for that? Well, maybe it needs 700

459
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,080
megabits.

460
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,120
So, why is Comcast pushing a gigabit

461
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,480
right now, even 3 gigabits? Because

462
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,840
their marketing department told them

463
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
that people are so stupid the only

464
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,039
number they can understand is speed and

465
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,440
more is better. That's a quote. And the

466
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,799
engineers in Comcast hate it because

467
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,240
they say, "We're having to build out

468
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,679
capacity we don't need in order to sell

469
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
a product the customer doesn't need

470
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,400
because that's what our market people

471
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,440
told us." Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

472
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Um, it's important to ask where will the

473
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,480
apps go next. And if you're trying to

474
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,400
figure out where the apps go. Well, look

475
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,880
in the lab. Look at MIT. See what's

476
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,120
going on. What's the what's the answer

477
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,400
of the day? Blah blah blah AI blah blah

478
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,400
blah. Okay. And now people are telling

479
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,480
me we need a new internet for AI.

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,160
You do?

481
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Uh, we didn't need a new internet for

482
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,799
video.

483
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,160
What about AI needs new capacity? Please

484
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,799
tell me that. I'm just waiting for

485
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,559
somebody to answer that question. And I

486
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,000
love I think AI is cool. I think it's a

487
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,799
bubble. All of those statement can be

488
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,240
true at the same time. But you know,

489
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,000
people said, "Oh, we have wireless. We

490
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,120
need a new internet for wireless." We

491
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
could have done a better job of

492
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,240
designing the internet for wireless.

493
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,480
It's too late now. We got what we have.

494
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,120
But it's good enough. It works. So what

495
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,880
what's the problem here? Um, I'm still

496
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,360
waiting for somebody to say useful,

497
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,559
something useful to me about the role of

498
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,760
the internet in the age of a

499
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,400
we're all going to be talking to our

500
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,600
agents. Okay,

501
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
maybe we have AI generated imagery. We

502
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,080
already have that. We have we have

503
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,480
synthesized AI video, some of which is

504
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,120
quite appalling and disgusting.

505
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,559
Um, but I'll come back to that. Still

506
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,640
just video. Okay. So what's actually

507
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,240
going on on the internet? If you ask

508
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480
about the connectivity that we're

509
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
deploying today,

510
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,919
we're getting actually beyond speed and

511
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,480
we're beginning to look at second order

512
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,320
parameters that make a difference like

513
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,799
variation in latency. This is a very

514
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,240
technical problem. It's called jitter.

515
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
You know, if I'm sending packets to you

516
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,120
and one of them's late, is that a

517
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,039
problem? I'd love to be able to sell

518
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,440
that product because Comcast knows how

519
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,720
to sell it. It's a premium for gamers.

520
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,120
Okay, I'm trying to get the marketing

521
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,559
department to understand how to sell it.

522
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,400
Now, um this, by the way, these

523
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,919
questions are relevant to the deployment

524
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
of broadband in the rural area because

525
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,120
people are doing federal asking for

526
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,679
federal subsidies. So, the federal

527
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,799
government asked, "How much is enough?"

528
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,640
Well, of course, everybody had a

529
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,240
self-serving answer to that question.

530
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,799
Okay, but we're getting over it. So, you

531
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,320
know, other kinds of connectivity I

532
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,840
could have talked about. Well, somebody

533
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,919
a minute ago said internet of things.

534
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,120
That was a little fad. You know, we

535
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,559
thought, oh, this is going to be we need

536
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,160
a new internet for things. Actually, we

537
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,559
do because things are so stupid.

538
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,640
Okay. They're so feeble they can barely

539
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,960
breathe. Okay. So, what do we have?

540
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,039
Well, sometimes in the home we have

541
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,520
little proprietary networks. I have a

542
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,159
little proprietary network that connects

543
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,840
my light switch to my lights. in a few

544
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,600
places. Doesn't have to be on the

545
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
internet, but there's actually a box in

546
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,960
my house that's a gateway. The system

547
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,200
can send me an email if something goes

548
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,960
wrong. Okay. So, you know, there's sort

549
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,480
of a shootout there between things in

550
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,159
the house that are working over Wi-Fi,

551
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,520
which is an open standard, and things

552
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,559
that are working over proprietary

553
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,720
standards, but I don't think the

554
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,000
consumer is being screwed at the moment.

555
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
Um, I don't know whether somebody's

556
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
going to talk about data centers today.

557
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,520
What's going on in data centers is

558
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,840
amazing.

559
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,520
It's all about AI, right? Because we got

560
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,039
these incredibly high-capacity chips and

561
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,000
you got to get high-capacity networking

562
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,600
into them. That's a technical problem.

563
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,360
That's not a money problem because it's

564
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,960
been internalized by the firm. And

565
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,400
that's some really cool stuff and I

566
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,799
don't I don't do that. I'm still

567
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,080
concerned with connectivity of the

568
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,720
internet at the global level. So, so

569
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,080
where's my research gone? My research

570
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,000
has gone up the layers. Um,

571
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,880
what were we hooking up? I we we thought

572
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,120
we were hooking up computers, right? And

573
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,720
we made some unrealistic and I'd say

574
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,760
simplistic assumptions about where the

575
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,799
apps would come from. But okay,

576
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,799
users don't hum normal people don't send

577
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,320
packets, right? They run apps. It's the

578
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,360
app that defines the internet

579
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,480
experience. I built the packet carriage

580
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,320
under layer. Yeah, I send packets just

581
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
to measure the internet, but I'm I'm

582
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,159
weird. Okay, you who who wants to send

583
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,960
packets? You just send you want the app

584
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,880
to run. What we didn't understand was

585
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,360
where is the app coming from? We had

586
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,880
this simple idea. Well, you know, you've

587
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,240
got a computer and you put some software

588
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,200
on your computer and that person puts

589
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
some software in their computer and

590
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,480
they'll talk to each other and all be

591
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,720
great.

592
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,440
Um,

593
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,120
no,

594
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,679
we're actually hooking up people. And

595
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,679
the problem is

596
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,480
people don't write code.

597
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,480
And so we didn't understand where the

598
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,559
apps were going to come from until the

599
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,039
big apps started showing up. The obvious

600
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,919
example that we're all alarmed about

601
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,440
today is social media, social networking

602
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
apps like Facebook, where everybody

603
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,640
says, "Oh, yeah, it's actually

604
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,159
wonderful, but it's also full of

605
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,400
disinformation and it's going to cause

606
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,760
the end of democracy and and we can't

607
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,600
stop using it because we're addicted to

608
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,159
it." And where'd that come from and why?

609
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,480
Well,

610
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,919
the internet started out as a

611
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,720
decentralized infrastructure. There's

612
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,679
75,000 ISPs connected together to make

613
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,120
the internet. The web is a decentralized

614
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,280
infrastructure. Anybody can run a web

615
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,880
server. Anybody can run a browser. You

616
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,080
can have anything. The domain name

617
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,600
system, which is a fairly technical

618
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,159
thing, but it's very decentralized.

619
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,400
Okay. And by the way, I don't have time.

620
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,520
But why is the domain name system

621
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,120
successful as a decentralized system?

622
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,799
because it's got a defined money routing

623
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,400
protocol

624
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,400
and I didn't even see it was about to

625
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,880
happen. Okay. But the centralized

626
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,720
solution like Facebook, okay, is it more

627
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,320
nimble? Yeah, they can make decisions

628
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,919
quicker. You don't spend five years

629
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,200
debating something in a standards body.

630
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039
But what's really powerful about a

631
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,559
centralized solution? All the money

632
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,159
routing has been internalized to the

633
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,159
firm.

634
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,159
And

635
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,440
this is where I didn't understand how to

636
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,880
think about hooking up people because

637
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,039
people don't have the power to shape

638
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,120
their online experience. They have to

639
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,799
use the code they're given. And the

640
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,880
question was where is that code going to

641
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,240
come from? And of course the other

642
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
problem is when we look at the way

643
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,960
people behave given things like social

644
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:22,080
media and so forth, some of their

645
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,400
behavior is what word can I use? Stupid.

646
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,120
irrational. Why the hell did you do

647
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,200
that? Okay, so the mantra of the

648
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,279
internet when we designed it was

649
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,120
permissionless innovation was a general

650
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,520
platform

651
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,120
and part of what we were concerned about

652
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,880
was making sure that the ISPs could not

653
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,240
manipulate the experience you had

654
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,919
because they can see all your packets go

655
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,200
by. So maybe they shoot that packet and

656
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,440
amplify this one. And we were worried of

657
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,360
course that's that's network neutrality.

658
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,760
Okay. But while we were busy worrying

659
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,919
about that, what we notice is that at

660
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,360
the application layer because the

661
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,520
internet all the intelligence is at the

662
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,919
edge. It's in your computer. But at the

663
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,240
application layer, all the intelligence

664
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,159
is moved back to the center. It's inside

665
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,200
Mr. Facebook or inside Mr. Google or

666
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,520
inside Mr. X. That's just like the phone

667
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,799
system where all the intelligence is in

668
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,360
the center. And so they could control

669
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,679
exactly what you did. We were worried

670
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,200
about the wrong villain. We thought the

671
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,600
ISPs were going to be the villain. No,

672
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,480
it's big tech. Okay. So, what did I do?

673
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm currently, as I said, in 1990s, I

674
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
hired an economist. I'm currently

675
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,320
collaborating with a behavioral

676
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,240
psychologist

677
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,720
to try to understand what happens when

678
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,720
you hook people up because they're so

679
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,440
weird. Okay? They're much more

680
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,440
complicated than packets.

681
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
And and and by the way, I would say if

682
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,080
you come to MIT and you want to see

683
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
innovation, that's cool. Cool stuff.

684
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
If you want to come to MI, if you want

685
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,400
to come to a place that really has a lot

686
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,120
of experience in the subtleties of human

687
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,120
interaction,

688
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,880
geeks aren't necessarily the best person

689
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,960
people to be talking to about that kind

690
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,960
of thing. So, um I would say there's an

691
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,840
interesting and painful dynamic going on

692
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,320
right now in this space, which is I

693
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:16,960
would like to see decentralized systems

694
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,559
be more viable. Okay, the web was

695
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,799
decentralized. Why can't we have a

696
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,799
decentralized social networking

697
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,799
experience?

698
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,320
Because we didn't design a money routing

699
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,400
protocol.

700
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
And if money can't flow among the actors

701
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,840
in a decentralized ecosystem, it'll die

702
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,240
and the centralized solution will take

703
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,720
over. We needed to design money routing

704
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,919
protocols. And that's what we're

705
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,559
connecting up. We're not connecting

706
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,000
computers. We're not connecting people.

707
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,880
we're hooking, we're connecting up the

708
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,080
money flows. And I I I couldn't say that

709
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,080
sentence in in 1995. I couldn't say that

710
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,720
sentence in the year 2005, but now I

711
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,919
understand it. So, as I say, I still

712
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,320
have an economist. But what I would like

713
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,600
to do is some research on decentralized

714
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,919
systems. And here's an interesting

715
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,919
question. Okay, obviously

716
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,919
federal money's gone to hell. I can't go

717
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,279
to NSF and ask for anything. You know

718
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,679
this, you know, let's not talk about it.

719
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,120
What's our lab doing?

720
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:26,000
We looking for industry money.

721
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,159
What does industry want? Solutions they

722
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,640
can monetize. Those are centralized

723
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,240
solutions. Why would big tech pay me to

724
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,799
design an architecture such that it

725
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,000
blows them into little pieces?

726
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,039
So, I can't get any funding for

727
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,480
research. Okay. But I do have an

728
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,520
behavioral economist that I'm working

729
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,000
with and I am an optimist. But the point

730
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,000
is

731
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,480
the ex the thing that's going to define

732
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,320
the future of the internet is not new

733
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,520
tech.

734
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,360
It's going to be the user experience and

735
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,159
we're waiting to see how AI changes the

736
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,840
user experience. Um it's possible that

737
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,200
there will be something happens there

738
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,080
that is so completely out of the blue.

739
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,640
We just didn't see it. But the buzzword

740
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:17,360
today is blah blah blah agentic AI which

741
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:21,520
is to say um we all have agents. So

742
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,000
I will close with a dystopian story

743
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,039
because I think sometimes you need a

744
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,039
ounce of

745
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,559
counter optimism. Okay. And MIT is a

746
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,159
place of optimism. We're all techno

747
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,840
optimists but and we were techno

748
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,440
optimists about the internet. But what

749
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,919
we were optimistic about was not the

750
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,120
tech. We were optimistic about how it

751
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,520
would be used, which is to say we're

752
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,880
being optimistic about people. Oh,

753
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
I was having trouble being optimistic

754
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,960
about people.

755
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,360
What's happening today?

756
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,200
People are being offered AI companions,

757
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,000
AI

758
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,399
pseudo people that you can talk to. I

759
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,279
don't have any slides,

760
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:11,039
so I can't show you a picture.

761
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:13,600
of the female companion that ex Mr. Musk

762
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,840
has created.

763
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,039
the system, his system is called Grock

764
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,200
and the the female companion is called

765
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,200
Annie Aani and she looks like a cross

766
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,720
between a uh a sort of a

767
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,080
Japanese

768
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:34,480
anime Lolita character

769
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,360
uh sexy as hell and she flirts with you

770
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,360
and she's easy to talk to. She doesn't

771
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,960
have all the social pathologies of real

772
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,399
people. She doesn't have bad days. So,

773
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,760
what's happening? We're raising a

774
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,200
generation of guys that are sitting in

775
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,720
the basement talking to artificial

776
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,039
entities and they don't know how to talk

777
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,399
to people anymore. We're raising a

778
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,840
generation of people that can't talk to

779
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,320
each other. All they can do is talk to

780
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,799
simplified AI simulations. That's my

781
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,240
pessimistic story.

782
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,679
Um, the more I learn about what

783
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,799
motivates people, the more I learn how

784
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,640
tricky it is to connect them up. And MIT

785
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,799
is a great place. It's as it uses

786
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,399
Institute of Technology, but the

787
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,760
problems I'm dealing with here are not

788
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,000
technology problems.

789
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,080
Oh, do I do we do questions? What are we

790
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,640
doing here? I've lost track. Are we

791
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,559
doing questions or am I out of here now?

792
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,320
>> We can do some live questions if there's

793
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,679
any.

794
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,320
>> Okay, I've lost track of the timing

795
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,760
here. The clock went to zero. I saw that

796
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,360
and so I stopped. But

797
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,440
>> couple questions.

798
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,000
>> Couple of questions that person said.

799
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,039
Anybody? Okay, sir.

800
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,480
>> Um, great presentation. Um, I know you

801
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,320
were instrumental in building kind of

802
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,520
like that early stages of the internet.

803
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,520
I'm wondering how you see the

804
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,720
introduction of agents also interacting

805
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,320
with internet. Do you think there's

806
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,240
going to be kind of like this new

807
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,760
protocol layer where agentic systems

808
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,480
kind of like interact autonomously? Do

809
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,679
you think um we're going to keep it a

810
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,880
lot as it is? Do you think it's going to

811
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,960
be centralized in one player? Do you

812
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,360
think it's going to stay decentralized?

813
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,840
>> Um, there's a lot of issues there and

814
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,000
the crystal ball is cloudy at the

815
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,399
moment. We have competing providers of

816
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,440
AI systems.

817
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,080
There are people who are trying to come

818
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,159
up with standards for interoperable data

819
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:23,840
that would allow you to move context

820
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,520
from one place to another. So, uh when

821
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,279
you when you do an AI query, if you're

822
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,720
doing sophisticated stuff, you can not

823
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,960
only put your prompted, but you can put

824
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,200
in some context. Okay? And there's a

825
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,440
protocol called model context protocol

826
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,039
MCP and it's supposed to be an open

827
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,240
protocol and we're trying to make sure

828
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,880
that people can use it. So that would

829
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,360
mean that you could move your

830
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,399
interaction with an AI agent from one

831
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,440
LLM to another LLM and I hope it will

832
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,720
play out that way. I know there are

833
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,039
people that are trying to facilitate

834
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,159
that. It's not decentralized. We're not

835
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,360
trying to get them to talk to each

836
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,799
other. We're trying to make it, we're

837
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,279
trying to empower the user by giving

838
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,640
them the power to exit so that they

839
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,799
could, you know, if they get bored with

840
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,880
Grock, please do. Um, you can go

841
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,757
someplace else. Um, and you can take

842
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,799
your history with you, too.

843
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:06,240
[clears throat] The history of your

844
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,200
interactions, your prompts, and the

845
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,320
responses. Um, I don't think it takes

846
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,399
any special kind of internet for agents

847
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,679
to talk to each other. Agents need to be

848
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,960
named so we can find them. We may need a

849
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,720
new directory architecture. And there

850
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,960
are people at MIT trying to design a new

851
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,919
directory architecture for agents the

852
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
project called Nanda so that uh there

853
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,600
would be just like we have DNS for

854
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,919
looking up hosts we might have a

855
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,360
directory system for looking up agents.

856
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,919
So I think people are trying to figure

857
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,679
out what's new and what's different. Um

858
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,480
but it's not going to require a whole

859
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,320
new protocol suite. You know I can I can

860
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,840
I can talk to an agent over the existing

861
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,120
protocols just fine. It's around the

862
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,960
edges where you're going to find these

863
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,720
new things that may actually affect the

864
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,720
industry structure like model context

865
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,720
protocol.

866
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,519
Thank you. David

867
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,519
>> stunned. Okay, good.

868
00:33:00,742 --> 00:33:02,762
>> [applause]
