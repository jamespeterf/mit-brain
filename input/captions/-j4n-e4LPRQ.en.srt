1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,560
You know, one of the most important

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,599
facts about architecture today is that

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,920
um building and the um the construction

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,639
and maintenance of building um uh

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,279
produces somewhere around 38% of

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,960
greenhouse gases contributing to global

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,519
warming. And therefore we need to um uh

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,119
radically rethink how buildings are made

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,519
and how we think about buildings. Not

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,480
least because with the global expansion

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,480
of population, we are predicted um if we

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,239
keep up current patterns to build as

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,200
many buildings in the next 40 years as

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,680
we have in the last 10,000 years. And so

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,800
unless we really rethink how we make and

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,399
build um uh we're going to uh get

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,640
ourselves in a very unsustainable

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,879
position. So um I mean in uh uh in both

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,520
my work and in fact in work throughout

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,199
the department we're looking at um how

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,800
we can reuse materials, recycle um uh

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,600
resources from previous buildings, how

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,960
we can adapt and reuse buildings um uh

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,559
just like our new home in the

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
architecture department in the old

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,960
metropolitan storage warehouse. Um uh

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,240
and these are all really important ways

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,720
to think about how cities and buildings

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,119
can adapt to to the future. One of the

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,040
projects I'm best known for is this

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,720
project called local code which started

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,320
as a way uh as a um speculative project

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,040
in San Francisco when I was at UC

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,280
Berkeley and it was a study of 1500 um

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
uh sites in San Francisco that the city

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
owned but didn't maintain. They were

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,799
called unaccepted streets because they

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,439
were either rights of way um uh that

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,720
weren't um used as streets or because

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
they were too steep, because they were

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,520
dead ends, because they were alleys

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,600
between um buildings. And um with a team

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,880
of students at at uh uh at Berkeley, uh

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,720
we showed how those um uh those sites,

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,040
if they were effectively maintained and

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,159
used for storm water retention, could

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,560
save the city um uh billions of dollars

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,079
in uh upgrades and modifications to the

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,319
storm sewer system. And so that um uh

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,720
project with its combination of both

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,440
digital techniques and really looking at

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,560
um the natural systems of the city uh in

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,920
a new way looking at how 1500 micro

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,879
interventions in the city could

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,640
aggregate um uh uh to produce a really

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,720
powerful effect uh is a an important um

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,280
snapshot of how I think about urban

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,360
design. Um uh cities are networks of

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,239
networks. They're organisms in their own

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,959
way. And if we think um along all the

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,519
ways in which a city works um uh and all

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,440
of its uh networks of of natural-made

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,239
systems work, we have a very powerful

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,280
ability to make more resilient cities um

65
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,440
to make more um uh more just, more

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,560
sustainable cities um as well. And so

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,360
that work continued through projects in

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,160
um with clients in uh LA and in New York

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,959
and is continuing um um even to this

70
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,519
day. Our current project is with uh a

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,599
partnership with um uh an organization

72
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,760
called Green City Force in New York uh

73
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,200
that does job training and urban

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
greening in New York City public

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,920
housing. And New York City public

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
housing is a particularly interesting

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,560
urban environment because um you know a

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
huge portion of the public housing built

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,319
in the city after the Second World War

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
was built in New York City. And if you

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,159
take all of New York City public

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,480
housing, you have a city itself which is

83
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,159
as big as Atlanta or Pittsburgh. And so

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,000
if we can make a small difference in

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,599
every single one of those places, we can

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
make a huge difference uh to New York

87
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,480
City as a whole. One of the um

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,440
uh key insights we've had about cities

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,360
in the last um

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,840
half century is that cities are not just

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,640
physical systems. They're combination of

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,640
physical, social, natural um uh uh

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,840
systems. And these systems all

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,920
intersect. And so when you um and the

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,840
social reality of the city is incredibly

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,599
important. Uh a city can be really

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,239
measured by the way in which it takes

98
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,319
care of its most vulnerable population

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
and uh by the mechanisms in place for

100
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,400
that. We have good mechanisms for um for

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,159
care in cities. Even just um uh

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
accessible and humane street

103
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,639
environments are are good for everybody.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,239
They're environments of of uh care and

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,519
the kind of the right kind of of

106
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560
collective surveillance of how

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,400
everybody's doing. Um and so the idea

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,919
yes that we um uh uh that we need to

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,360
take care of everybody in a city and a

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,000
city is itself um an environment where

111
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
uh we judge cities by the way in which

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,840
they take care of their most v

113
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,000
vulnerable populations. Um not just uh

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,000
children but uh older people as well

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
often uh um best taken care of together.
