1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,000
[Music]

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
okay so now you have an understanding of

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,280
the experiment that was performed for

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,800
the data science Challenge and now we're

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,360
going to move into the last section

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,080
which is what does that data look like

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,119
and how do we work with it so uh you're

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,840
going to be able to load the data into

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,640
the python environment using these

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,400
packages scan pi and and data and so

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,320
scan Pi is a python package that's

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,320
commonly used in the Single Cell

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,160
analysis community and it's very

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,960
streamlined and hopefully easy to use

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,680
for you and within scan Pi there's

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,280
another package called and data which uh

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,320
allows us to load in the data and

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,800
organize it in a very sensible uh way so

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,520
scanpy and and data uh are going to be

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,960
the main tools that you can use to at

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,360
least get the data into your hands and

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,239
start to work with it and so I'll give

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,920
you a few lines of code that might help

24
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,559
you along the way so you know when we uh

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,199
are going to load the data we're going

26
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,480
to import scan pi and when you import

27
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,519
scan P that will bring along and data

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,439
and then other useful packages could be

29
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,439
numpy or pandas okay so and data is

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,240
short for annotated data and it's a way

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,680
to structure the data and the two pieces

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,400
of and data that we're going to care

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,000
about the most are what are called X and

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,759
OBS or observation so X is going to be

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,079
where the gene expression Matrix is

36
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,759
stored so if your and data object that

37
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,479
you load up is called a a data then the

38
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,479
gene expression Matrix will be loaded by

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,439
just typing a.x and similarly uh for

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,880
every single cell in the gene expression

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,040
Matrix we're also going to have metadata

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,560
and that's going to be stored in the OBS

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,320
or observation uh data frame which is a

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,439
pandas data frame and OBS will have for

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,200
every single cell what perturbation that

46
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,280
cell received as well as what cell State

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,680
we assigned uh that uh T Cell to so

48
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,240
we've already gone through an analyze

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,280
this data and assign t- cell states to

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,280
every single cell in the data that we're

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,080
going to give you now to load up the

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,680
data uh that we're going to give you an

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,680
object that's an H5 ad file and you can

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,760
load it up using the read H5 ad function

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,200
and that will give you your and data

56
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,800
object which we're just going to call a

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,400
data in these slides and that object you

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,760
can just look and it has a a gene

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,560
expression Matrix in it as well as an

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,800
observation data frame so let's look at

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,560
these individual pieces separately so

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,720
the gene expression Matrix is stored in

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,519
a.x and this is a sparse Matrix uh and

64
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,959
it's a sparse Matrix because to remind

65
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,800
you single cell RNA sequencing data the

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,360
gene expression matrixes have a lot of

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,480
zeros so you can actually Store The

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,680
Matrix in sparse format and uh the

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,800
Matrix has Dimensions observations by

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,560
variables so the observations are the

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,360
number of cells that were profiled

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,040
31,000 here and the number of variables

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,239
or features the number of genes were

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,680
measured 15,000 now this number 30,000

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,680
cells is different from the number I

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,680
told you earlier and that's because

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,200
we've done quality control to the data

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,440
and we'll talk a little bit about the

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,280
steps that were done in the quality

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,599
control but this is the final number of

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
cells you're going to be given now to

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,440
look at some of the uh values in that

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,400
expression Matrix we can just convert to

84
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,480
an array and now you can see the

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,000
expression values and again you can see

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,120
lots of these zeros which is why we

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,599
store it in spar format finally we can

88
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,080
load up uh the names of the cells and

89
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,640
the names of the genes so we have ob's

90
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,799
names and VAR names so OBS names um you

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,200
know you see these very long strings

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,360
that are describing the cells and you'll

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,920
see the string of atcs and G's and that

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,959
comes from the DNA barcode that was

95
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,599
introduced to label the different

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,439
transcripts from every single cell and

97
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,560
this goes back to lecture two where we

98
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,519
introduce the Single Cell isolation

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
techniques using micr

100
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,000
so the names are not super important but

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,680
just so you're not wondering what these

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,200
atcs and G's are and then we also have

103
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,959
the G names which are very interpretable

104
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
and Within These set of gen names there

105
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,320
will be genes we've introduced in the

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,440
lecture like tcf7 or

107
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,880
pdcd1 so that's the and data uhx uh

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,919
Matrix and then we also have the a dat.

109
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,759
OBS which is this pandas data frame

110
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,960
which has for each cell different

111
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,160
metadata describing that cell and the

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,880
two main columns that we care about are

113
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,000
the genetic perturbation the cell

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,320
received so for instance this cell

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,600
received a non-targeting perturbation

116
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,880
meaning that's a perturbation that

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,000
doesn't affect the cell shouldn't affect

118
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,600
the the t- cell and then this cell

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,120
received a perturbation the tox 2 and

120
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,320
tpt1 and so forth and then we also have

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,759
the t- cell state that we assigned after

122
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,720
doing analysis of this data and remember

123
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
there are four functional t- cell States

124
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,000
in this challenge the progenitor t-

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,080
cells the affector t- cells the

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,039
exhausted T cells and the cycling t-

127
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,960
cells and you'll find all of those in

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,600
this

129
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,280
metadata okay so um one of the things

130
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,360
that we're going to be really focused on

131
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,280
is for each genetic perturbation what

132
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,360
are the proportions of t- cell States we

133
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,000
find for that perturbation so here's

134
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,960
some code to Simply calculate uh for

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,280
every single genetic perturbation What

136
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
proportion of cells are in each t- cell

137
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,160
state so for instance this is

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,120
perturbation one and we find that 28% of

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,759
the cells for perturbation one are in

140
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,440
the terminally exhausted state and 26%

141
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,479
of cells are in the progenitor State and

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,960
then we can look at the last

143
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,520
perturbation perturbation 63 and we find

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,160
that 50% of the cells are in the

145
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,919
progenitor t- cell State and 28% are in

146
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,479
the cycling t- cell state so this is

147
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,720
just a simple code to calculate the

148
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,199
proportions of t- cell States for each

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
genetic

150
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,919
perturbation now I'll just show you some

151
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,759
of the raw data so here what we're

152
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,000
looking at are all the genetic

153
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,960
perturbations that were applied in

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,759
Mark's experiment and the y- axis is the

155
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,840
number of cells in which that genetic

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,919
perturbation was detected and the

157
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,759
perturbations are ordered by number of

158
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,680
cells in which they were detected and

159
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,639
this is a log scale and what you can see

160
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
is that most cells have more than aund

161
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,280
most perturbations are detected in more

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,080
than 100 cells and um we want the

163
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,880
perturbation to be detected in multiple

164
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,360
cells because um increased sample size

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,440
for a perturbation is going to give us

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,960
uh a better sense of the effect of that

167
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,720
perturbation uh single cell RNA quencing

168
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,919
data is very noisy uh so the more

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,039
measurements we can make of the same

170
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,479
perturbation across multiple cells the

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,120
more confident will be in inferring that

172
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,000
perturbations effect on gene expression

173
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,919
so fortunately most perturbations are

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,639
detected in many many cells but this is

175
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,639
something to keep in mind that the

176
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,680
number of cells we look at kind of

177
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,160
affects like how confident we are for

178
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,400
inferring any perturbations

179
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,160
effect so next I just want to tell you

180
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,919
what quality control and normalization

181
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,120
was done on this data so um I want to

182
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,400
remind you that when we introduce these

183
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,280
perturbations into the te- cells I

184
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,599
describe this as each t- cell gets one

185
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,960
genetic perturbation now that's a little

186
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,840
bit of a simplification so ideally you

187
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
know we would like a t- cell to just get

188
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,080
one perturbation and not zero

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,919
perturbations or many perturbations but

190
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,199
actually the number of perturbations

191
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,919
that get introduced into a cell when

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,160
doing this process of introducing

193
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,479
perturbations using crisper cast 9 the

194
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,800
number of perturbations that get

195
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,520
introduced into a cell follows a Pon

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,919
distribution meaning that most cells

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,520
only receive one perturbation but some

198
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,520
fraction of the cells receive two or

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,479
more perturbations and some fraction of

200
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,599
the cells receive no perturbations so we

201
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,759
do quality control to remove cells that

202
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,520
receive two or more perturbations

203
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,479
because we are not powered to infer the

204
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,319
effects of combinations of perturbations

205
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,280
in this data that would take looking at

206
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,720
hundreds of millions of cells so we

207
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,680
remove these cell here we also remove

208
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,280
cells that receive no genetic

209
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,720
perturbation and you might ask why do we

210
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,919
do that well part of the reason is that

211
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,240
um cells that receive no genetic

212
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,599
perturbation they might have not

213
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,039
received a perturbation but there might

214
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,520
also be a technical reason that we

215
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,240
weren't able to detect the perturbation

216
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,240
and we would like to model what

217
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,080
unperturbed cells look like but the

218
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,919
experiment is designed such that we can

219
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,360
use the non-targeting controls uh to

220
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,840
model that distribution so we really

221
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,039
need these cells we can actually just

222
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,240
use the non-targeting control uh uh

223
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,800
perturbations to infer what the t- cell

224
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,000
State distributions look like in an

225
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,680
unperturbed State and then finally we

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,320
remove cells where perturbations have

227
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,519
very low counts because those are

228
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,880
technically probably lowquality cells so

229
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,040
that's the quality control and then what

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,920
we end up doing is for every cell we

231
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,720
normalize the total gene expression so

232
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,680
now the total gene expression is just

233
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,560
going to sum to one and then what we do

234
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,000
is we multiply all of that by 10,000 so

235
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,320
now this total expression sums to 10,000

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,720
we add one and take the logarithm okay

237
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,079
so once we've done um this uh cell

238
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,839
quality and normalization we carry out

239
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,600
the rest of the Single Cell sequencing

240
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,320
analysis where we do feature selection

241
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,600
dimensionality reduction using principal

242
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,000
components analysis and then graph-based

243
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,800
clustering okay so here we have the

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,640
results from the experiment that Mark

245
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,920
performed where he did perturb seek in

246
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,839
t- cells and so here we're showing a

247
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,000
embedding a umap embedding of the 30,000

248
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,880
t- cells that pass quality control and

249
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
to remind you the umap embedding is

250
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,600
calculated from the cell's principal

251
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,120
component scores and the idea is that

252
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,480
it's preserving uh the similarity

253
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,480
between cells that exists in high

254
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,720
dimension and it's projecting that down

255
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,480
into two Dimensions so two cells are

256
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,240
similar to one another if they have

257
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,720
similar gene expression profiles in high

258
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,920
dimension and then if they are similar

259
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,200
we want them to be close to one in two

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,440
Dimensions so here these two cells are

261
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,240
are similar to one another and have

262
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,920
similar gene expression profiles and

263
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,360
here these two cells are close to one

264
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,680
another have similar gene expression

265
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,600
profiles so we calculate the umap

266
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,680
embedding for all the 30,000 t- cells

267
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,200
that pass the final quality control and

268
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,279
then we color them by uh their cluster

269
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,320
identity that we derived in the previous

270
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,480
uh slides so starting with regenor cells

271
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,240
we can ask um what genes are more highly

272
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,200
expressed in this cluster relative to

273
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,800
all the other clusters one gene that

274
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,480
will come up is tcf7 which we know marks

275
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,920
the progenitor T Cell State uh we can

276
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,360
also look at the terminal exhausted

277
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,720
cells and one gene that is more highly

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,279
expressed than those relative to all the

279
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,839
other clusters is pdcd1 and that helps

280
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,959
us Mark the terminal exhausted state so

281
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,000
we can do this for all the Clusters and

282
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,240
this allows us to identify the four main

283
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,440
t- cell States we see in cancer namely

284
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,480
the progenitor State the affector state

285
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,639
the terminal exhausted State and the

286
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,760
cycling State okay so now we get to the

287
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,880
really fun part of the uh data which is

288
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,920
we can link the gene expr we see in

289
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,880
single cells in the cell state to the

290
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,519
perturbation that that cell received and

291
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,279
we can ask how do the perturbations

292
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,839
affect the proportions of t- cell States

293
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,800
we see so first let's just calculate the

294
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,040
overall t- cell State proportions in all

295
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,320
the data so we see that there are 10% of

296
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,920
T cells are in the progenitor State uh

297
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,040
30% are in the affector state 20% are in

298
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,399
the terminally exhausted State 30% are

299
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,760
in the cycling State and 10% are what we

300
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,920
call other now let's look at what

301
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,480
happens when we do a genetic

302
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,040
perturbation and I'm going to leave

303
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,920
these perturbations label but we're

304
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,240
going to perturb you know a single Gene

305
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,920
and ask for all the cells that receive

306
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,160
that genetic perturbation what's the

307
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,240
resulting proportion of T Cell States

308
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,279
and what we see is that the uh

309
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,079
progenitor t- cell State proportion went

310
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,920
up it's 40% now and the uh exhaust the

311
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,440
terminally exhausted t- cell State

312
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,560
decreased and this could be a really uh

313
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
beneficial thing for cancer

314
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,120
immunotherapy because as we discussed

315
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,120
before we think progenitor States and

316
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,240
affector states are more effective when

317
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,959
responding to cancer now in stark

318
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,040
contrast to this we can look at a

319
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,720
different perturbation perturbation 2

320
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,800
and here we're just showing all the

321
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,519
cells that receive perturbation 2 and

322
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,839
what you see is there's this big drop in

323
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
the progenitor t- cell State and a big

324
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,600
increase in the terminally exhausted t-

325
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,760
cell State here and so this you could

326
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,279
think would be really bad in cancer

327
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,600
because these terminally exhausted te-

328
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,079
cells are unable to really respond and

329
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,120
control cancer and then finally we have

330
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,880
these really clever negative controls

331
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,399
where these cells all received a

332
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
non-targeting control perturbation and

333
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,480
we can look at the proportion of t- cell

334
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,399
states there and we can compare that to

335
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,760
the genetic perturbations that actually

336
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,519
affect a specific Gene and so we can

337
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,399
always just do these comparisons between

338
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,000
the negative control and the actual

339
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,040
genetic perturbation to infer how a

340
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,920
genetic perturbation affected the

341
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,399
overall t- cell State

342
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,880
proportions okay so now hopefully you're

343
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,600
starting to see uh how all these

344
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,639
challenges fit together so the first

345
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,199
challenge task is to predict the t- cell

346
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,440
State dist distribution so remember Mark

347
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,880
measured 70 genes in his experiment he

348
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,000
made 70 genetic perturbations we're only

349
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,800
giving you 63 of those perturbations in

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,720
the training set and we're going to ask

351
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,360
you to predict the effect of the seven

352
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,480
other genetic perturbations that are in

353
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,519
the test set and so these perturbations

354
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,279
might increase or decrease the different

355
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,199
states so one perturbation as we saw

356
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,800
here increase the progenitor t- cell

357
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,920
State and another perturbation that we

358
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,880
saw here increas the terminal exhaust of

359
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,079
t- cell state so we'll ask you to

360
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
predict the effects of these

361
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,279
perturbations on the t- cell State

362
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,720
proportions then in the Second Challenge

363
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,760
we're going to turn this problem on its

364
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,880
head a bit and we're going to ask you

365
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,920
know given that we want to maximize some

366
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,000
te- cell killing objective what are

367
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,040
genetic perturbations we could make to

368
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,800
get there so let's define both sides of

369
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,760
that so first what do I mean when I say

370
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,720
maximize t- cell killing objectives so

371
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,120
uh one thing that we think would improve

372
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,800
immunotherapy is if we had a higher

373
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,079
proportion of t- cell states in the

374
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,800
progenitor State and the affector state

375
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,759
and a lower proportion of t- cell states

376
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,839
in the terminally exhausted state so

377
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,480
that's an objective that we want to

378
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,839
maximize and we think that's going to

379
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,360
make uh te- cells better at killing

380
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,360
tumor cells we think that's going to

381
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,320
make car T cells less exhausted and we

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,199
think that's going to have benefit to

383
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,519
checkpoint blockade therapies so that's

384
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:20,040
the objective function and what we're

385
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,959
going to ask you to do is think about

386
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,519
all 20,000 genes that are out there and

387
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,320
choose the best three genes that are

388
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,759
going to maximize that objective so what

389
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,639
are the three genetic perturbations that

390
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,560
could really give you more t- cell

391
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,800
killing so one perturbation that seems

392
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,680
like it's going in the right direction

393
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,519
is maybe this perturbation one where we

394
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,839
have more progenitor te cells and a

395
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,320
perturbation that seems like it's going

396
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,000
in the wrong direction is this

397
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,279
perturbation where we have more terminal

398
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,360
exhaust te-

399
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,560
cells and then finally the last

400
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,160
challenge will be to propose a

401
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,480
quantitative metric to rank the efficacy

402
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,440
of the different proposed uh

403
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,680
perturbations and so now we've reached

404
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
the end of our introductory lectures and

405
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,040
we've gone through the biology behind

406
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,639
this data science challenge the tech

407
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
technology that's enabling us to do

408
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,399
these experiments the experiment itself

409
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,720
that Mark did to do perturb seek and

410
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,639
melanoma and how you can work with the

411
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,279
data yourself and really get into the

412
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,839
challenge and so uh we're really excited

413
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,240
about this and we hope you are too we

414
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,600
can't think of anything more important

415
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,240
to work on than making cancer

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
immunotherapy better so we thank you for

417
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,880
your participation and hard work in this

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,950
and I just want to wish you good luck

419
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:29,659
and have fun with this thanks
