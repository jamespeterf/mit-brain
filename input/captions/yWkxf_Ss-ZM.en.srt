00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,480
Moore's law was an observation by Gordon

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,400
Moore that when you looked at the number

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,200
of integrated circuits you could put on

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,280
a computing device, that number was

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,480
doubling every [music]

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
year or two. More recently, in general

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,119
purpose computing, we haven't really

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,640
seen a lot of performance improvement.

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,720
You could argue that Moore's law hasn't

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
really kept up there. What we mostly

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,279
seen recently is what we call

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,719
accelerators where chips are designed to

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,060
do very specialized operations. AI being

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
kind of one of the biggest drivers of

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,600
[music] that. I think many of us could

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
not have anticipated the scale of

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
investments to [music] get the next

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,079
level of computing. The largest

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
companies in the world are very much

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,960
involved in this and so ultimately

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,160
limits are usually the scale of

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,160
investment. Find your MIT moment. Visit
