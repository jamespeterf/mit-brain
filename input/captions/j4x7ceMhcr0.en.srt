00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,799
hello everybody I'm excited to be

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,640
presenting a video by the renowned

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,519
professor and uh artist George Lewis on

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,760
computers and improvisation I just want

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:29,439
to give a quick introduction to how much

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,840
his work had an impact on me I remember

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,040
hearing various projects on teaching

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,320
computers to do things like uh

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,480
automatically accompany a jazz

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,960
improvisor so that it would do exactly

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,239
what he or she you know wanted and put

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,440
the right chords at the right place and

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,160
then hearing a comment from George Lewis

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,719
on how that's exactly wrong in the

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:58,199
spirit of jazz in the African-American

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,320
tradition that when we

17
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,680
have improvisor

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,000
and they work in a group the other

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,000
people aren't pure uh accompanists

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,439
they're collaborators and one of the

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,479
things that a collaborator should do is

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,920
respond to you and one of the responses

23
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,520
is well if you get into a rut and you

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,479
keep doing the same things it shouldn't

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,479
be letting you stay in that rut if you

26
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,759
keep playing the same chord progressions

27
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,600
well a good jazz group will start

28
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,880
playing different chords for you or or

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,119
mix up the Rhythm to try to make you

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,040
have to think and stay in the spirit and

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,520
um there were comments about you know

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,280
with uh with the early history of jazz

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,759
coming out of a tradition of uh people

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,439
who had been through the Injustice of of

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:55,320
enslavement that why would we want a

36
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,840
computer system that replicates Jazz to

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:03,159
be the slaver servant of a master

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,759
performer so that there's an ethical

39
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:10,200
dilemma in ethical component of how we

40
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,280
teach computers to improvise and that's

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,720
why I think this video is very important

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,720
for you to see
