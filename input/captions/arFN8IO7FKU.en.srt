1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
I'd like someone in the audience to uh

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,960
let me borrow from them a real $1 bill.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,440
I'm going to soak it in this clear and

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,360
colorless liquid which looks like water.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,400
So, here is the dollar bill on fire. Or

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
is it?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,039
>> Dr. Shakashiri soaked the money in a

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
solution of water, rubbing alcohol, and

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,519
a little bit of table salt. When he puts

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,080
the money in the flame, the alcohol

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,640
burns, reacting with oxygen, producing

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,880
carbon dioxide and water and heat and

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,840
light energy. So, why doesn't the bill

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,360
burn? Alcohol is evaporating off the

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,239
bill, turning into a gas and burning.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,800
So, those are the flames that you see.

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,879
But remember that the solution is 50%

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,360
water. The water is evaporating much

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,520
less quickly than the alcohol, staying

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,600
in the bill [music] and preventing the

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
paper from burning.
