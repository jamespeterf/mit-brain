1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,839
we have now another panel with uh rock

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,240
stars that we present you in a second

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,320
it's a pleasure to to introduce to the

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,360
panel named triple Innovation for a

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,160
sustainable future technology policy and

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,080
business models the session highlights

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,039
the need for Innovation to boost

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,320
sustainability across Industries the

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,720
panelists will explore how Advanced

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,720
Technologies public policies and

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,559
business model work together and will

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,000
help us uncover practical strategies for

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,920
a more sustainable future to uh moderate

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,600
the panel I will invite ameritus

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,399
Professor dong lar he is the AEK found

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,079
Foundation professor of International

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,440
Management and professor of system

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,359
engineering at MIT Don advises companies

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,199
governments and universities and

20
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,399
continues his research on global

21
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,719
strategic management and very large

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,440
scale project management on a personal

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,159
note it's is a pleasure to see Don again

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,560
he was my professor many many years ago

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,400
so uh don please take it away thank you

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,520
okay great uh let's see if we can keep

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,960
the energy of this morning uh the point

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,840
of this panel is you you come to MIT for

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,520
technological innovation but Innovation

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,320
and change requires policy technology

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,439
and a change in business models we want

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,920
to see those three we've got a panel

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,840
that represents those three beautifully

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,560
uh Elizabeth Reynolds who is a professor

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,720
of practice in the department of urban

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,360
studies and planning

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,159
focusing on systems of innovation

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,040
manufacturing and Industrial

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,520
competitiveness she was Special

40
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,479
Assistant to President Biden on the

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,920
national uh for manufacturing and

42
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,360
economic development for the National

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,960
Economic Council and was responsible for

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,719
a lot of the developments in US

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,799
industrial policy prior to work at the

46
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,040
White House she did some uh pathbreaking

47
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,320
research again on Industrial policy

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:01,159
through the uh industrial performance

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,479
center here at MIT uh yet M Chang is

50
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,560
a star technological innovator he's got

51
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,520
several billion worth of firms that have

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,920
come from it what I really like today is

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,120
he's got oh well he's Professor uh of

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,360
heera Professor of Ceramics professor of

55
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,959
Material Science and Engineering elected

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,879
member of the National Academy of

57
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,000
engineering he's brought several

58
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,840
laboratory discoveries to

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,400
commercialization including high-powered

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,160
lithium ion batteries more efficient

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,120
battery processing batteries for long

62
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,560
duration electrical chemical cement and

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,760
most recently electrical Aviation so

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,560
long span of sustainability oriented

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,959
Innovations and then Joe hicken who is

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,599
the vice president for business

67
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,959
development uh of sublime systems which

68
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,000
is a company using yet Ming's uh

69
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,440
Innovations on cement is going to

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,239
replace the process of cooking Limestone

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,319
with heat to Rel re re-release CO2 so uh

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,400
if you look for reducing embodied

73
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,840
emissions there's no better example so

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,080
we'll go right into it uh Liz you've

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,760
played a key role in crafting the return

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,680
of industrial strategy can you tell us a

77
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,400
little bit about how the policies really

78
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,400
changed in the last four years what were

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
the most important accomplishments in

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,640
that what's the real unfinished business

81
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,040
and I know a lot of your focus is for

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,120
getting us firms to work on developing

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,799
technology in the US that's that's right

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,200
um I uh I should say first I went I went

85
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,720
down to Washington as special assistant

86
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,080
to the president for manufacturing with

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,680
a whole host of ideas and focus

88
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,400
particularly scale up as a as a key

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
issue um the reality is from day one to

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,280
my last day there I was working on

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,319
supply chain crises during the pandemic

92
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,159
of All Sorts um but the flip side of uh

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,680
you know building resilient Supply

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,599
chains is in part building domestic uh

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,040
capacity and and um very much so in the

96
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
last couple years I think it's fair to

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,799
say the US has really put itself on a

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,120
new trajectory around Industrial

99
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,879
strategies focusing on uh resilience uh

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,879
investment in semiconductors clean

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,680
energy critical minerals uh quality jobs

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,479
um and building a more vibrant uh

103
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,840
manufacturing ecosystem not only for our

104
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,639
existing uh Industries but also for the

105
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,680
sort of Frontier Industries which are

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,520
represented here uh on the on the dis

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,600
but what I would say is that I think the

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,479
the goal in all of these was was with

109
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,759
all of these goals about building you

110
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,280
know building more capacity and and

111
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,320
focused on critical critical

112
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,199
Technologies and and for National and

113
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,280
economic security the the mechanism for

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,479
doing that has always been how do we

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,320
crowd in private sector investment

116
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,759
because there's no possible way uh a

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,160
federal government is going to actually

118
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,720
make you know have enough to invest in

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
so if you were to only use that measure

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
uh over the last couple years you'd say

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,360
that these policies have been a huge

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
success in the US because they have

123
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,400
actually attracted a lot of private

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,000
sector investment um over 500 uh billion

125
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,720
at this point between semiconductors and

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,199
clean energy and so if that were our

127
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,440
only measure of course it's not our only

128
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,520
measure but we'd say that we're on the

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,919
right track in terms of creating an

130
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,360
environment for greater investment for

131
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,160
building you know some of these critical

132
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,160
um critical Technologies and and

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,400
companies um I also think that when we

134
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,080
look at what's what's been going on

135
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:33,000
another major um effort here has been to

136
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,840
figure out ways in which uh workers and

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,400
Technology are uh are working are kind

138
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,440
of coexisting and Investments happening

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,400
on both sides because if we look

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
historically at at the trajectory again

141
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,160
for the country we've seen this growing

142
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,440
inequality that's had a lot of negative

143
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,600
repercussions uh on the economy so I'd

144
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,800
say that has also been I'd see built

145
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,880
into a lot of the policy and The

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,280
Unfinished Business oh well unfinished

147
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,400
business so it's funny you should

148
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,000
mention it um been working with Brian De

149
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,120
uh who's an innovation fellow here as

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,720
well as Simon Johnson a recent Nobel

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,880
laurate as of last week on sort of what

152
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,639
is the next wave of industrial strategy

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,919
and and certainly I think there's three

154
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,280
categories of ways to think about this

155
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,080
um one is Frontier Technologies where we

156
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,759
are still um in in Need for significant

157
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,599
investment not only in the R&D but also

158
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,919
in deployment so biomanufacturing and

159
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,440
Quantum might fit in that um investments

160
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,800
in areas that we think uh are important

161
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,240
but we haven't really formalized that so

162
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,960
I'd say critical minerals Advanced

163
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,240
manufacturing and then the unfinished

164
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
business around um the the first steps

165
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,639
we've taken on semiconductors and clean

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,000
energy as a country um there's obviously

167
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,160
you know I keep saying we have to land

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,759
the plane uh on these billions of

169
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,080
dollars that have uh are being spent and

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,240
obviously you know we won't see you know

171
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,599
perfect uh success for another decade or

172
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,440
two but we have to really uh be

173
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,800
monitoring and figuring out what are the

174
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,000
obstacles to to ensuring that those

175
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,919
those uh those areas you know reach

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,599
their goals great thank you yet Ming

177
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,800
you've been at this at this game for

178
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:13,919
what 25 years or so A123 and 24m and for

179
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,000
energy and Sublime systems and what

180
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,599
what's changed in the policy environment

181
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,199
for a technological innovator and

182
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,759
Company founder over this time let me

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,280
first uh Riff Off something that liist

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,840
say she said you know one of the roles

185
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,840
of policy is to stimulate private

186
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,360
Investments I've been a huge beneficiary

187
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,879
of that

188
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,840
and uh if you for instance in the early

189
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,639
stage you know the kind of research I'm

190
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,000
mostly involved in here at MIT you know

191
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,120
uh RP as an example as a government

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,400
agency that in clean tech is considered

193
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,479
by many to be you know uh the smartest

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,879
people in the room and if you're out

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,199
raising Capital uh private Capital uh

196
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,879
that the government support is a huge

197
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,879
positive indicator and a lot of cases if

198
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,879
you don't have it they say well why

199
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,319
don't you have it you know what's wrong

200
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,400
with your idea that the federal

201
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,080
government hasn't funded it yet right

202
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,520
and so uh that's that's been huge but uh

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,919
so what's happened in the last decade or

204
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,240
so I would say that so first of all you

205
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,240
know we uh actually do have industrial

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,720
policy

207
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,240
now uh if I go way back and more than a

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,479
decade ago to uh 2008 uh The Recovery

209
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,280
Act funding

210
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,479
A123 what was not funded what was funded

211
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,400
was Capital to build uh battery

212
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,000
manufacturing plants

213
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,279
there was almost no effort to on the

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,200
market side and so even a uh a lead

215
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,479
customer like General Motors who had

216
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,360
just been bailed out by the federal

217
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,800
government uh was not even encouraged to

218
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,279
Source

219
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,920
domestically for their

220
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,560
first H big change that's a big change

221
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,959
yeah and so that would never happen

222
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,120
today right and so that that that I

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,200
think is huge uh the other so maybe I

224
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,600
can say something about more General

225
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,480
about you what is the role between

226
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,160
technology and policy and I've uh I'm a

227
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,880
believer that

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,560
technology uh is when technology shows

229
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,120
an approach to be plausible that's when

230
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,000
policy starts to act you we don't have

231
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,240
policy right now on geoengineering for

232
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,560
example right good reason nobody knows

233
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,120
whether it's plausible someday we may

234
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,880
have policy on Geo engineering when but

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,360
uh uh when you show something is

236
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,959
technologically possible then the policy

237
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,360
follows I'm not going to use any Sublime

238
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,920
examples I'm going to leave all those to

239
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,720
Joe but I'm going to give you one uh

240
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,160
form energy example in this area for the

241
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
last several years there's been a lot of

242
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,839
attention to something called long

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,839
duration energy storage problem has been

244
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,839
nobody knows what long duration means is

245
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,360
it there was a time when 3 hours was

246
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,320
considered long duration is it 3 weeks 3

247
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,680
hours uh poorly defined so form energy

248
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,480
starting about 5 years ago realized that

249
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,079
it was important to define the category

250
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,279
where the the biggest impact would be

251
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,040
and so uh just within the last month it

252
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,440
said the California p uh now has a

253
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,480
mandate that by

254
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,200
2026 uh there will be procurements for a

255
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,920
gigawatt each of something called long

256
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,680
duration storage and something called

257
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,120
multi-day storage now long duration in

258
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,839
this case has been defined as greater

259
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,959
than 12 hours multi-day storage has been

260
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,720
defined as something greater than 24

261
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,440
hours multiple days and that second one

262
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,800
exists because for manag put the effort

263
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,079
into developing that policy working over

264
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,959
several years and just to put a number

265
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,320
on you know what's a gigawatt for the

266
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,000
battery that for energy is building and

267
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,160
we have we building a gigafactory right

268
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,040
now in wton West Virginia that's 100

269
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,040
gwatt hours of of storage it's huge a

270
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,279
gigafactory is something over 50 gwatt

271
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,519
hours a year so it's a couple years

272
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,600
production of the plant that's going in

273
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,680
right now

274
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,639
yeah so um going forward what aspects

275
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,320
are going to be most important in policy

276
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,880
again you had nothing nothing to support

277
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,120
the demand in those early years now we

278
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,120
have more demand support yeah and I and

279
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,279
I think uh you know so we're developing

280
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,519
these Technologies because we see a need

281
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:24,639
there and to help help it scale to make

282
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,560
it real the kind of support you need is

283
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,480
policy that I identifies that as a as a

284
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,279
need a good thing and you know uh some

285
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,760
cases subsidies but other cases other

286
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,399
mechanisms right so great super

287
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,880
important great so now turning to Joe

288
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,399
and Sublime systems is is going to

289
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,680
replace cooking Limestone um to what

290
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,040
extent are you a taker versus a shaper

291
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,920
of policy following this last point and

292
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,720
you know going forward how do you think

293
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,680
about the scenarios of the policy

294
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,639
context you're going into and how does

295
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,320
how does that influence your business

296
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,320
strategy absolutely so I think the the

297
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,760
answer is uh unfortunately both uh both

298
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,240
Taker and shaper uh I think I was two

299
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,880
months in on the job at Sublime systems

300
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,160
and the inflation reduction act kind of

301
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,600
arose From the Ashes and was passed and

302
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,560
yet said where's the production tax

303
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,440
credit for low carbon

304
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,320
cement um and that was uh okay all right

305
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,240
uh time to get to work um there were

306
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,880
there were other policies included

307
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,560
within the inflation reduction act that

308
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,639
have lifted sublim system systems uh off

309
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,720
I think the the investment from the

310
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,079
office of clean energy demonstrations

311
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,639
they selected Sublime systems for an $87

312
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,240
million uh investment to help us scale

313
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,920
our first commercial manufacturing

314
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,199
facility in Western Massachusetts um and

315
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,560
so not only is the cash and fusion

316
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,160
critical um but also as yet was

317
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,399
mentioning the diligence from the

318
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,240
federal government putting you through

319
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,320
that full rigorous uh review process

320
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,720
establishes credibility in the you know

321
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,199
the viability of the technology the

322
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,000
viability of the business um and then

323
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,320
the you know the the the end users and

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,160
the engagement with the commercial

325
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,800
Market demonstrating that you've got a

326
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,720
thing that can be scaled um but that

327
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,560
said right uh the inflation act

328
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,360
reduction act had you know a couple

329
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,079
components but it can go further and we

330
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,040
need to go further to decarbonize

331
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,839
Industry especially cement and concrete

332
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,160
and and therefore uh being very

333
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,120
proactive on policies such as advocating

334
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,720
for a production tax credit um that that

335
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,560
provides incentives at the point of

336
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,720
production right reducing the economic

337
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,279
um risk to traditional project Finance

338
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,160
for these types of Technologies is so

339
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:38,399
key to get these lifted off um and then

340
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,079
and then additionally right the the

341
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,920
public sector in the case of cending

342
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,040
concrete and building infrastructure

343
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,320
they're the sponsor of of about half of

344
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,079
the concrete that's deployed um in the

345
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,440
nation every year so not only are they

346
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,320
policy maker that can accelerate

347
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,160
industrial decarbonization but they also

348
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,959
play a role as major buyer and purchaser

349
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,480
through a very long uh protracted value

350
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,480
chain from the point of cement at the at

351
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,880
the concrete missing truck all the way

352
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,959
to the point of actually building the

353
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,320
building the bridge or the or the

354
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:11,680
roadway um and so at Sublime systems

355
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,800
right um we've got many bets uh kind of

356
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,639
inlight right now and some of these some

357
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,160
of these are are Innovative commercial

358
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,560
transactions with private sector

359
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,279
partners that are leveraging um what you

360
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,480
would think of as a public sector sort

361
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,079
of policy structures to get to Value

362
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,480
sooner um a terrific example of that was

363
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,199
just recently we announced that we

364
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,560
signed anou with the intent to close a a

365
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:36,759
binding off-take agreement um that's

366
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,199
inlight right now um but with the

367
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,720
Microsoft to purchase the environmental

368
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,519
attributes of the cement that we'll be

369
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,160
manufacturing at scale separate from the

370
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,399
actual cement itself it doesn't make

371
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,600
sense for sublim systems to ship um

372
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,680
thousands of tons of cement from Western

373
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,519
Massachusetts to a Microsoft campus in

374
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,160
Redmond Washington for example um and so

375
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,320
instead we can kind of separate out um

376
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,040
and virtualize the the value of that

377
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,440
lowc carbon construction material deploy

378
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,680
it locally in some structure that would

379
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,800
use otherwise high carbon cement um and

380
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,240
and Microsoft would uh own the the

381
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,880
environmental attribute of that

382
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,240
transaction so so I think innovating

383
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,160
business models uh engaging with policy

384
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,560
makers on on both uh uh uh Financial

385
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,279
structures and incentives as well as

386
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,680
carrots that help kind of nudge us along

387
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,440
forward is going to be such a key um you

388
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,639
know a key gating Factor on how fast we

389
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,959
decarbonize and yeah go ahead I was just

390
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,399
going to say on the carrots front I mean

391
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,560
I think what's really profoundly

392
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,399
different is that the effort this time

393
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,120
is really about a carrots rather than

394
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,839
sticks approach and the use of tax

395
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,680
credits has been you know uh one in

396
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,440
which they've been very structured for

397
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,000
companies to get a basic tax credit but

398
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,440
then they they augment depending on

399
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,199
these different incentives are you

400
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,560
providing apprenticeships are you

401
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,120
investing in a stressed area you know um

402
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,319
all of these things that are actually

403
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,560
providing an incentive for companies to

404
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:10,720
lean into those Investments so that we

405
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,480
switched the challenge now before we you

406
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,199
know it was a supply side challenge now

407
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,639
it's a demand side challenge we have a

408
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,440
more you know more demand than we can

409
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,240
actually uh respond to right now in the

410
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,920
country so that's that those are

411
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,880
profound I think in terms of the

412
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,120
strategy yeah and Joe the the B clean

413
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,000
aspect how does this work to yeah so B

414
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,680
clean is actually an example of of of

415
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,480
great intention policy but the signal

416
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,800
hasn't trickled its way down to a

417
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,759
company like Sublime systems quite yet

418
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,880
um and that's not to disparage the the

419
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,319
intent behind the policy I think the the

420
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,800
The Architects behind that structure see

421
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:52,720
this um and in fact you can you can see

422
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,880
a great example um the bclean folks have

423
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,079
a pot of money in the inflation

424
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,560
reduction act for the GSA and a pot of

425
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,240
money for the fhwa the federal highways

426
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,839
admin Administration um the signal from

427
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,559
the federal highways Administration has

428
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,880
made its way Belin to sublim systems

429
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,079
very effectively the implementation of

430
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,079
the GSA Federal buildings money the the

431
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,400
vertical construction has not made its

432
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,880
way because of the way that the policy

433
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,839
structured in terms of at what point

434
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,880
does a contractor get rewarded for using

435
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,520
low carbon materials the RFP process

436
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,600
there's 100 points how many points do

437
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,480
you get for using low carbon materials

438
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,559
you only get two extra points for using

439
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,640
the clean concrete on planet Earth right

440
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,360
um so so low carbon is good enough and

441
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,120
then we satisfy some low carbon as

442
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,320
opposed to really low carbon that's

443
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,320
exactly right so the how right uh and

444
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,600
the incentives right change Behavior a

445
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,679
great deal so the fhwa implementation

446
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,919
has led to mot signaling requesting a

447
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,600
quote from Boston sand and gravel the

448
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,280
local concrete producer in the region to

449
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,960
supply their low carbon uh projects in

450
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,440
Boston s and gravel entered into a

451
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,440
non-binding reservation agreement with

452
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,240
sublim systems and that was all

453
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,919
triggered by the inflation reduction act

454
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,400
through fhwa so that's an an example of

455
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,400
a policy that did flow down well and

456
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,440
yeah go ahead oh I was just going to

457
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,720
make the point that uh you know Sublime

458
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,679
is a four-year-old company having a

459
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,080
person like Joe at a four-year-old

460
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,840
startup is a pretty unusual thing yes

461
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,679
we've learned to do that uh you know a

462
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,000
startup engaging the policy right that's

463
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,559
right and in the past by the time we got

464
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,120
around the policies I wish we had

465
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,559
started that a couple years earlier

466
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,320
we're getting smarter about that we have

467
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,840
guys like Joe now right uh working on

468
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,559
this already to pave the way and uh I

469
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,720
also want to just say Joe you didn't

470
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,799
tell him about the uh the party we had

471
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,440
last night oh yeah last night uh we we

472
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,520
had a a retirement party a very uh a

473
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,000
very boisterous retirement party

474
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,039
respectful uh for we were retiring

475
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,679
ordinary Portland cement it was the 200-

476
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,240
year anniversary of the original filing

477
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,880
of the patent uh for for traditional way

478
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,360
of making C man Joseph

479
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,360
October 15th

480
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,360
1824 so I'll end with a business model

481
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,200
question I don't know whether it's for

482
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,320
you y Ming or for you Joe but you know

483
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
when when Sublime grows up is this going

484
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,760
to be a global cement company like holom

485
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,760
or is it going to be Sublime

486
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,159
inside I mean uh the jury's still out uh

487
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,919
and I think that's a you know our

488
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,039
mission is to have a Swift and massive

489
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,480
impact on climate changing emissions um

490
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,280
you know the question is what's the

491
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,840
fastest path and who are the partners

492
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,360
that get to yes fastest um I think for

493
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,200
us we've got a really cool manufacturing

494
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,320
uh technology a great engine so far

495
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,480
we're going to build our first

496
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,679
commercial plant it's going to be a

497
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,720
Sublime plant we'll continue with the

498
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,640
process of building Sublime plants but

499
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,799
the reality is the the the folks that

500
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,440
man manufacture cement today it's not

501
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,360
just about the manufacturer of cement

502
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,320
it's about the mining and the coring of

503
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,000
the Raw Feed stock and it's about the

504
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,080
distribution of that material after the

505
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,159
point of manufacturer to the end user

506
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,480
that's a

507
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,600
mind-bogglingly complex uh

508
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,120
infrastructure we respect that and we'd

509
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,440
be very eager to um to engage uh uh

510
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,360
thoroughly with the folks that have

511
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,280
built these uh these arteries in the uh

512
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,280
globally through decades if not

513
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,679
centuries and recently we announced uh

514
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,760
investment from pulam and CR um that

515
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,960
involved Equity uh off take as well as

516
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,400
exploration of of joint development and

517
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,799
and and and Joint buildout so um so we

518
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,159
look to explain both and maybe for for

519
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,280
the folks in the audience who may not uh

520
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,120
have seen the scale of cement production

521
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,200
you know a fullscale cement plant is a a

522
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,600
million tons a year the US has about 106

523
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,880
of those and so that's the domestic

524
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,400
industry uh our first commercial plant

525
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,520
in Holio Massachusetts in one of those

526
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,799
distressed communities uh is 30,000 tons

527
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,720
and that's the roughly the annual

528
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,960
consumption of a ready miixed producer

529
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,039
one of the local produc such as Boston

530
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,360
stand and gravel and so that gets us the

531
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,720
scale of you know True commercial

532
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,240
demonstrations yeah and you know we feel

533
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,120
like we have to get through that phase

534
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,960
to show that uh it all works right and

535
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,200
then your question you know which way do

536
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,720
you go hopefully we have optionaly and

537
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,760
we'll figure it out that's

538
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,320
right okay even though we had three

539
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,919
speakers we have uh 10 minutes for Q&A

540
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,240
so we'd be delighted to have questions

541
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,240
from the

542
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,240
audience I know it's after lunch but

543
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,200
somebody must have a

544
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,279
question I'm just GNA I'll just keep

545
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,679
talking until somebody raises their hand

546
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:39,000
um I think there's one of my favorite

547
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,279
quotes that the journalists made is that

548
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,720
to decarbonize we have to

549
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:48,360
reindustrialize and so this moment is uh

550
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,039
important obviously from a

551
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,960
sustainability point of view but it's

552
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,919
converging and I'd be interested in

553
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,320
hearing your guys when you're building

554
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,640
facilities it is converging with a

555
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,720
moment where we also have advanced

556
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,880
Manufacturing Technologies where we can

557
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,520
manufactured differently now I think

558
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,640
than we have in the past and so this is

559
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,799
you know the challenge of the industrial

560
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,520
transformation is it's in the weeds of

561
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,279
these policies but it really is a much

562
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,880
larger you know we've got this

563
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:19,679
convergence of supply chain issues

564
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,240
climate issues geopolitical issues uh

565
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,279
and then we have the policy at our way

566
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,320
you know at our backs and then we have

567
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:26,120
the technology that's also making this

568
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,320
you know quite quite possible in a way

569
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,799
that we wouldn't have seen it 10 years

570
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,320
ago great we have a great question for

571
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,320
the audience so how can the value of

572
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,679
sustainability be economically modeled

573
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,000
as a profit or investment and not just a

574
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,440
cost and I'll start with the academic

575
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,799
answer and then I'll let you guys give

576
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,080
the real answer but it's think about the

577
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,760
value proposition think about value

578
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,600
delivery which is the cost in the

579
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,799
process and think about value capture

580
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
which is where you stand competitively

581
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,919
and if you don't go through those three

582
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,760
you don't have an economic model right

583
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,159
you're going to start with me okay well

584
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,750
because I don't know the answer to that

585
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,960
question

586
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,400
[Laughter]

587
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,039
and um and I I really don't know the

588
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,080
answer to that question but in all the

589
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,480
industrial decarbonization efforts that

590
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,200
I get involved with the projects that

591
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,960
attract me are the ones where you can

592
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,480
see a path to you know form fit function

593
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,200
replacement at Cost parity decarbonized

594
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,840
yeah right if you can do that there then

595
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,240
you know then the Tailwind are with you

596
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,279
and and uh getting valued in other ways

597
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,440
is just gravy so if it's not right if

598
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:33,720
it's not uh profitable it's not

599
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,720
sustainable right Joe anything on that

600
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,679
or um I mean I think this gets the the

601
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,559
point actually the a lot of the

602
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,799
companies that yet have spun out and

603
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,240
maybe we'll discover as self-cloning

604
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,440
company uh down the road in terms of his

605
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,440
ability to be everywhere all the time um

606
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,880
but but I think it's it's a much broader

607
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,720
and much more massive value proposition

608
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,120
now the trick is landing that value

609
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,520
proposition amongst the various users

610
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,720
and the the value chain so in the case

611
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,520
of cement and concrete right we care

612
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,000
about the asset owner who owns the

613
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:11,080
actual building or or Bridge um how are

614
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,679
they monetizing or valuing that asset

615
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,760
because they're they're you know some

616
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,039
are monetizing and leasing space some

617
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,679
are conducting a business activity

618
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,640
within the space uh brand matters

619
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
especially more and more young people uh

620
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,039
in terms of human capital and human

621
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,000
capital retention folks are focused on

622
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,360
climate companies want to be competitive

623
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and they want to retain the best um

624
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,080
Talent um and so they want to attract

625
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,880
those types to their companies um that's

626
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,520
just one you know in user and then

627
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,840
there's the general contractor that

628
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,000
wants to be known for uh being at The

629
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,279
Cutting Edge of of of design and

630
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,679
construction Architects want to always

631
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,279
build the the latest kind of visionary

632
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,799
um structures um and then youve got the

633
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,760
the Ready miix Concrete producers that

634
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,240
are mixing the concrete and uh you know

635
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,919
they want to be value adders not simply

636
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,520
just U tolling entities within the space

637
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,360
and we get that a lot with with the

638
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,840
folks that we engage with and so it's

639
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,600
difficult to say okay this this

640
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,880
intervention has X specific dollar

641
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,480
attached to it for each of those actors

642
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
but in aggregate we get a lot of

643
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,520
Engagement because they're they

644
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,520
incentives are kind of aligned with the

645
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,240
sustainable interventions and and the

646
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,640
functional versus the emotional eror

647
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,640
with the brand I mean really the two

648
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:28,600
aspects absolutely yeah um another

649
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,279
question uh what are the iMed mediate

650
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,200
challenges and long-term challenges so

651
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,679
that can go to anybody right that's for

652
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,919
policy that's for invention that's for

653
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,520
execution November

654
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,120
five see who Rises to that one most

655
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,480
that's a tough question right I mean I

656
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,480
will just maybe I'll talk I'll start

657
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,559
with the long-term challenge which is or

658
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,159
maybe immediate and longterm so one so

659
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:54,960
again we've created this great

660
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:57,240
demand um we've emphasized through these

661
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,720
tax credits and things deployment that

662
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,799
that is the quickest way for us to

663
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,440
iterate and Advance these Technologies

664
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,960
and hopefully spread them uh globally

665
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,880
and then and but then we recognize that

666
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,919
our infrastructure is not actually up to

667
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:15,799
the task right we have a grid challenge

668
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:17,919
um and so how we upgrade and Advance our

669
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,039
our connectivity and transmission Etc

670
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,080
seems like a very immediate Challenge

671
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:25,159
and one in which we're facing you know

672
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,520
challenges in terms of Disconnect across

673
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,600
regions and and things like that um I

674
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,440
think longer term challenges is again

675
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,600
from the perspective of you know

676
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,360
decarbonization the the challenge we're

677
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,960
making progress in the US and we'll

678
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,039
we'll move the needle importantly over

679
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,799
the next uh you know for our 2050 goals

680
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,520
but really what we need to see is a lot

681
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,559
of movement happening in uh the

682
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,399
developing world and so how are we

683
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,080
thinking

684
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:54,360
about again scaling these Technologies

685
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,600
and then deploying these Technologies

686
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,320
globally where we don't have at this

687
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,440
point in time really a fi Financial

688
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,480
mechanisms at the scale we need for that

689
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,919
kind of deployment people are talking

690
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,200
about a Marshall Plan you know uh is

691
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,480
kind of one of the ideas out there um

692
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,159
there's a number of different ways in

693
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,279
which people are really trying to think

694
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,399
long term you know to the extent we're

695
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,000
successful these these guys are

696
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:19,919
successful how are we're going to take

697
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,080
that technology and really be able to

698
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,480
scale it globally yeah all right so I'm

699
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,880
G to give you an answer which may

700
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,799
surprise you because it's not about

701
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,760
technology right uh you know I live

702
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:35,000
through clean tech 1.0 we're in kind of

703
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,360
The Sweet Spot of 2.0 uh but uh I I feel

704
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,880
that it's really important that uh clean

705
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,960
Tac the things that we're doing end up

706
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,640
providing a return and to all all the

707
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,320
stakeholders but uh certainly the the

708
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,200
the private Capital right you know I'm a

709
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,200
person who's spent his

710
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,679
entire life doing what I want to do with

711
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,640
other people's money starting from when

712
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,320
I was a graduate student I funded my

713
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,159
research funded by Doe and so all the

714
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,360
things that I want to do I I do it with

715
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,960
other people's money whether it's the

716
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,559
government or private capital and I feel

717
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,880
very that in this phase we're at we

718
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,000
really have to show that clean tech can

719
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,679
be profitable in order to keep that uh

720
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,679
enthusiasm

721
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:23,960
going um I think at least for sublim

722
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,880
systems uh our manufacturing process is

723
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,120
all electric uh we're going to need a

724
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,000
lot of clean electricity so we need to

725
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,840
do um part of the course of voices

726
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,399
seeking to decarbonize the grid across

727
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,840
the board and create new um zero carbon

728
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,840
energy generation across the board

729
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,919
that's going to be the long-term

730
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,640
challenge near term just building our

731
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,919
first plant wrangling General

732
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,519
Contractors it's a big

733
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,080
task great so now a series more

734
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,760
questions Joe you talked about Microsoft

735
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,840
you know purchasing the the carbon

736
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,320
Savings of of your cement

737
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,799
um are there other sectors we see this

738
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,279
type of thing becoming important and

739
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,159
yeah this is actually uh borrowing from

740
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,600
the sustainable Aviation fuels uh sector

741
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,000
very specifically um which is borrowing

742
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,600
directly from virtual power purchase

743
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,480
agreements okay so Advanced off takes of

744
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,559
of a production process that you don't

745
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,480
quite have access to in your own supply

746
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,279
chain um and so Microsoft is essentially

747
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,240
borrowing that that Playbook and using

748
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,519
that to inform the you know the the the

749
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,240
market across the board they're not

750
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,559
looking to be the sole uh one

751
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,399
transacting in this regard very engaged

752
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,279
with this new center for Green Market

753
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,320
activation to build a really a scaling

754
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,840
across Industries and applications of

755
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,840
this technology really a technology of

756
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,360
grabbing the credit and the and the

757
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,200
reality is that it's not it's not for

758
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,720
trading it's to purchase that

759
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,080
environmental attribute and immediately

760
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,679
retire it as different from say carbon

761
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,640
markets which are far more squishy and

762
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,360
less tied direct to like a a commodity

763
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,440
or intervention and a an environmental

764
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,080
attribute associated with that there's

765
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,080
another question here which I'd like to

766
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,799
take in almost two parts can we

767
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:12,159
decarbonize industry by electrification

768
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,000
boss it's a good question and then with

769
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,039
without big industrial policies or

770
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,200
government subsidy so it's really both

771
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:21,279
parts

772
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,240
right because electrification alone yeah

773
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,840
maybe you guys will make it but a lot of

774
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,919
Industries still won't get there with

775
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,600
just electrification that's right you

776
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,440
know uh

777
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,880
so the technical sies electrification

778
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,399
generally we're talking about not just

779
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,120
providing heat through electricity

780
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,240
that's actually pretty inefficient it's

781
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,679
carrying out a chemical reaction right

782
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,559
so we had the bricks this morning that

783
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,240
said here's a way of beating that but

784
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,240
yeah yeah so yeah electrochemistry I'm

785
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,240
an electrochemist electrochemistry is

786
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,720
not the answer to all your uh hopes and

787
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,000
dreams and uh and you know so if you'd

788
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,559
say you know what what are what are some

789
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,320
of the limitations of electrochemistry

790
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,760
well it takes place at interfaces it's

791
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,600
not a volume reaction that's one thing

792
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,320
that we have to realize so you know what

793
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,240
what we've found are there are places

794
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,960
where so let's just take the sublime

795
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,200
cement example um we're not just

796
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,200
electrifying it we're reducing the total

797
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,360
energy required to make that cement yeah

798
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,919
and that's that's the key that's how we

799
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,639
will get it to cause parody and so we

800
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,120
don't take it through that huge thermal

801
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:25,679
Excursion which requires fossil fuels

802
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,320
and also you know the problem with

803
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,880
important cement where the reason we're

804
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,480
retiring is is that you know it uh you

805
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,639
go through this

806
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,760
huge energy expenditure to create a

807
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,559
super dry product that and you then

808
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,200
hydrate it you hydrate it when you

809
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:43,200
hydrate it gives off heat but you're

810
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,279
never able to use any of that heat so

811
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,440
this huge energy Excursion we looked

812
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,760
that said that doesn't make any sense if

813
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,159
you're going to make a hydrate as your

814
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,080
final product how about you start off

815
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,840
with something that's partially hydrated

816
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,679
that's what we do efficiency not

817
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,039
electrification exactly exactly and the

818
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:59,519
electrification helps with the

819
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:01,720
efficiency but at the end of the day is

820
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,320
the Energy Efficiency that matters uh

821
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,799
our clock is telling us we're out of

822
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,039
time we're just starting but this is

823
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,159
great fun so think about always the

824
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,720
triangle on on Innovation it is

825
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,690
technology policy and business models

826
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,789
thank you very much thank you than

827
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,789
[Applause]
