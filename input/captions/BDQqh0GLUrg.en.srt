anniversary of becoming a faculty member

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,519
at MTL so I always joke that the MTL was

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,480
established in honor of my arrival at

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,519

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:32,640
aside um I'm I'm truly honored to host a

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,879
really distinguish it uh panelist on

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,840
today's topic on MTL impact in the next

13
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:38,399

154
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,840
fellow so let's again welcome all the

155
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,840
panelists

156
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,479
so um I believe MTL has been at least

157
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,520
fairly successful uh in its mission in

158
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,360
the past uh 40

159
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,639
years and uh we would like

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,360
to as the panelist um their thoughts on

161
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:26,280
the next 40 years uh of the M of MTL

162
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,520
what we should do and what we should not

163
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,519
do for example but uh we would like to

164
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,680
to put this in perspective so put it uh

165
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,680
to put it in the right context let's

166
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,399
just review mtl's impact uh during the

167
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,919
past 40 years or so uh Tomas pesus gave

168
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:49,320
a really nice presentation on history of

169
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:53,399
um MTL uh MTL and this is sort of a very

170
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,560
brief summary of what um Tomas uh talked

171
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,760
about in the

172
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,040
morning uh again uh the panelist we went

173
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,040
through them

174
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,480
um let's

175
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,320
see so uh first of all MTL has been an

176
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
interdepartmental laboratory for

177
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,000
Semiconductor fabrication so it offer

178
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,560
the uh tools and the facilities for

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,200
Semiconductor fabrication for every

180
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:24,360
member of MIT Community as well as um uh

181
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,480
outside uh

182
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:31,640
MIT and this part of the mtl's mission

183
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:35,560
has been transferred to MIT Nano in 2018

184
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,800
about 6 years ago but not only MTL

185
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,760
provided the tools and facilities for

186
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,920
Semiconductor fabrication it also

187
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,680
provided tools and services for uh

188
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,519
design for example device circuit and

189
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,720
system design they maintain all the cat

190
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,440
tools and

191
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,519
licenses and uh for design of IC PC

192
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,959
boards and photonics and

193
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:04,040
mems uh one of the very important

194
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:06,800
mission of MTL was being an inter uh

195
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,880
departmental research laboratory and as

196
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,040
such uh it's been an intellectual home

197
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,440
for more than 60 core faculty members so

198
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,360
as of now we have U almost 70 core

199
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,760
faculty members at MTL as thas

200
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,680
mentioned and MTL has been known for

201
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,000
very strong collaboration with industry

202
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,880
through its Microsystems industrial

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,440
group or M and many of its um uh

204
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,320
research C centers such as CICS uh Med

205
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,240
RC and MIT CG and other

206
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,040
centers and although this is more like a

207
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,120
consequence rather than the initial goal

208
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,120
uh MTL motivated a lot of startups uh

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,040
because MTL uh researchers came up with

210
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,639
uh so many exciting ideas it motivated

211
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,959
the startups and as Tomas thas mentioned

212
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,600
in the morning uh

213
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:07,040
there there are more than 50 spin-offs

214
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,040
of the MTL research as a startup

215
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,680
companies um research has been a very

216
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,000
very strong uh point of mtl's past

217
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,160
history and here's a very partial list

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,760
of the uh pioneering research that

219
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,000
originated from

220
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,639
MIT uh I want to mention that this is

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,560
really a very very uh partial list and

222
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,000
uh please don't be offended if you don't

223
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,639
see your own research in this list

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,800
because the true uh list is very very

225
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,720
long uh with hundreds of ENT uh entries

226
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,240
if not thousands of entries so I had to

227
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,839
make it uh fit in one page so again

228
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,519
please don't be offended if you don't

229
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:57,680
see your own research

230
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:01,639
yes uh so these have a widely ranging

231
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,320
industry and scientific Community um

232
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:09,639
impacts like the twist Electronics uh

233
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:12,000
from uh Pablo rioo uh R and quantum dot

234
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,040
strain silicon super deep retrograde

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,360
Channel doping from Dimitri Anton

236
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,000
antonetti's lab also from antonier Lab a

237
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,839
virtual Source velocity F model that's

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
been widely adopted by industry and an

239
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,160
chantra cousin's Dynamic voltage and

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,279
frequency scaling is used pretty much

241
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,519
everywhere these days uh Charlie sadin

242
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,839
group's high order Delta Sigma ads

243
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,480
became industry standard and Son Han's

244
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,279
activation orware weight quantization

245
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,959
has been uh really adopted very very uh

246
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:51,079
widely in uh machine learning industry

247
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,720
and uh bbnz and Jo emmer Iris high

248
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,480
energy efficient reconfigurable

249
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,800
accelerator has been adopted widely and

250
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,040
there are again hundreds and thousands

251
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:06,120
of U others like this um so MTL has had

252
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:10,040
a very very strong history of impact on

253
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,320
the research field so now the question

254
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,360
is what should be the impact of mtl's

255
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,839
next 40 years 40 years is a very long

256
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,040
time so it is it's going to be very

257
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,480
difficult to predict but uh I hope uh

258
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,839
the panelist will have some thoughts

259
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,240
first of all again it's a very long time

260
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,120
and I would look like

261
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,959
this according to photoshop but I think

262
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,519
Photoshop is actually very

263
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,120
underestimating the effect of Aging so I

264
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,800
would be more than happy if I look like

265
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:51,639
this at the age well over

266
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,800
100 okay with that um I would uh invite

267
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,560
I would like to invite the panelist to

268
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,759
kind of provide us with their view what

269
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:04,399
MTL should look like what MTL should do

270
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:08,079
uh in the in the next U 40 years and uh

271
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:11,399
we have Susan's slide on this machine so

272
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,759
naturally I would like to invite Susan

273
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,759
that's good

274
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,720
engineering to uh give her point do you

275
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,360
want me to stand there or just uh yes

276
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,240
you can stand here on the the podium and

277
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,240
you got a clicker there oh thanks thank

278
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,160
you for having me and happy iversary to

279
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,160
the MTL and to Harry

280
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,000
congratulations

281
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,199
great I think I was here for 32o I hope

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,320
I'm here for 50 um so this slide I think

283
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,920
what's what you're seeing semiconductors

284
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,519
transformed the world I think all of us

285
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,880
know this right like we all know this

286
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,680
and now the rest of the world is

287
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,440
learning this since the pandemic as it

288
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,440
was talked about this morning the

289
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,600
awareness of semiconductors and

290
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,199
everything they impact almost every

291
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,320
aspect of our economy they're changing

292
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,000
um and contributing to our health our

293
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,920
Safety and Security our quality of life

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,079
it's it's just amazing and and it's

295
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,279
amazing to think that in 1947 while it

296
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,680
wasn't invented here um the transistor

297
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,680
that then be went to a four planer

298
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,079
transistor circuit in the

299
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,000
1950s that now today uh Nvidia has

300
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,040
announced the black weld chip that has

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,720
208 billion transistors on it that's

302
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,199
just like amazing and I know that we're

303
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,680
all being driven and propelled by

304
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,680
Moore's law but it's and and a lot of

305
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,920
people think it's just about the you

306
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,680
know the feature size and that next node

307
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,399
but we all know that's the contributions

308
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,639
and the work that you've all done and

309
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,440
others because it's at the materials

310
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,079
level it's it's strained materials it's

311
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,600
it's low K and high K dialectric it's

312
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:59,079
new devices and architectures finfets C

313
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,279
fets it's it's new packaging Packaging

314
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,920
is like really hot right like who would

315
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,639
have thought um it's it's circuit design

316
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,120
it's the architecture it's it's the

317
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,839
whole system solution and I it's like

318
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,959
amazing where we've come I think we

319
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,759
should all be proud of that but there's

320
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,120
a long way to go and there's a lot of

321
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,199
challenges I mean there's the the

322
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,279
climate's changing um the world the

323
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,639
geopolitics our safety our security our

324
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,839
health the healthcare I made a lot of

325
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,120
emphasis on that today and yesterday I

326
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,880
think that there's so much we could do

327
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,040
there so with great challenges come

328
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,880
great potential and I think that's the

329
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,959
way we should look at it is there so

330
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,079
much that we could be doing from the

331
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:46,360
health care perspective to um prevention

332
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,720
early detection diagnosis treatment so

333
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,839
that we can all live healthier and

334
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,120
longer lives um from Automotive

335
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,440
perspective from a safety perspective

336
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,759
there with autonomous driving um

337
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,399
electrification of vehicles there's so

338
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,680
much more that can be done

339
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,760
we you know longer range on our vehicles

340
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,480
from the energy I mean we need to

341
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,640
diversify our sources of energy we need

342
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,720
to strengthen our grid we need to um

343
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,959
Renewables we need to shift to that

344
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,799
there's there's a lot that we could be

345
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,799
doing there and increasing the

346
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,520
efficiency um security communication so

347
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,480
there is a lot we could be doing and as

348
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,079
I noted before I think that we have to

349
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,480
be doing it in a holistic fashion and I

350
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,160
know that many of you you've seen this

351
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,559
before it's the full stack right from

352
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,039
the materials to the application Level

353
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,080
and everything in between and what I'd

354
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,000
like to see is it looks more like this

355
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,600
is that we need to be co-developing

356
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,679
co-designing

357
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,039
co-optimizing and it was talk today

358
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,440
there was a lot of talk on combinatorial

359
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:53,039
and heterogeneous integration and system

360
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,120
Solutions but it you really need to be

361
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,480
optimizing at the whole stack you need

362
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,039
to be thinking about what materials

363
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,440
you're going to be using in in those new

364
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,480
devices and

365
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
and how you're going to be you know I

366
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,000
think Ry was saying just don't just want

367
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,520
to buy a bag of chips you know they you

368
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,880
want to go to chiplets but then you

369
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,280
still need to be thinking about the

370
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,400
interfaces and and all the challenges of

371
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
combining them and co-designing so

372
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,039
there's a lot of challenges out there

373
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
and I know that these I I think Ray said

374
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,559
it too he said a lot of good things

375
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,280
today right he always does but when he

376
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,720
said that you're like a kid in a candy

377
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
store and there's so many things out

378
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,520
there to be working on so in the next 40

379
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,520
years there are a lot of things and I

380
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,559
know that where I'm working right now

381
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,240
with ncast I worked at Analog Devices

382
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,520
for 36 years so I want to talk about

383
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,799
that a little bit too because Jen

384
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,880
couldn't make it but um I've only been

385
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,200
six months at ncast but ncast was formed

386
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,240
as part of the chips act and so if you

387
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,000
look at for those of you that may not be

388
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,480
familiar with it there was 52 billion

389
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,400
that was approved for the chips act 39

390
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,720
billion of it is for manufacturing to

391
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,120
onshore to have that security of Supply

392
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,799
to bring back those the Leading Edge

393
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,000
nodes to the United States and and

394
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,320
Legacy

395
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,200
nodes along with that we had 11 billion

396
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,080
was allocated for

397
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,360
R&D and I think it's really smart of the

398
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,280
government I remember Marty Schmidt who

399
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,039
was a MTL director he's now president of

400
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,000
RPI he gave a talk at Congress and

401
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,640
talked about the inextricable link

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,640
between manufacturing and R&D and we

403
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,960
can't just onshore manufacturing and

404
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,360
expect that that's going to be it we

405
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
need to be investing in the Next

406
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,799
Generation

407
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,799
technology in order to have sustained

408
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,039
leadership for the future and that's

409
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,360
what this 11 billion is for and there's

410
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,400
and that's through the docc there was

411
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,760
two billion that's also through the drd

412
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,679
dod and that is the microelectronics

413
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,280
common funding that many of you are

414
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,200
probably familiar with we even part of

415
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,760
so the the doc 11 billion and the reason

416
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,840
I'm talking about this is I think that

417
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,159
what we're trying to do here is a lot of

418
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,840
what the MTL has tried to do and and and

419
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,039
the example that they've set is so the

420
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
11 billion was split between the nstc

421
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:04,120
which is the national semiconductor

422
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,360
technology Center and I'll talk about

423
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,799
that more a National Advanced packaging

424
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,400
program manufacturing USA which is

425
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,559
focused on digital Twins and that was

426
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,840
announced just earlier this week that

427
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,679
SRC is won that and is going to be

428
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,240
leading that and then the chips

429
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,480
Metrology

430
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,880
program I'm under the

431
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,840
nstc and nstc is a

432
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,919
Consortium public private Consortium we

433
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,919
want everybody participating in it we

434
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:36,240
want Academia we want government we want

435
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,240
industry industry large and small and

436
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,760
across that entire stack these solutions

437
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,840
that the challenges that we have and the

438
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,559
solutions that we need are going to

439
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,720
require interdisciplinary and it's going

440
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:49,039
to require everybody working together so

441
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,240
that's what and and ncast where I am is

442
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:56,520
a um a nonprofit purpose-built entity to

443
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:00,159
operate the nstc so we'll be standing up

444
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,880
um facilities um supporting research um

445
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,000
initiatives in various ways we'll have

446
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,960
an innovation or investment fund we um

447
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,640
want to help reduce that time and cost

448
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
to prototyping so really a lot of what

449
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,600
we're setting up is to help startups and

450
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,320
small businesses to lower the barrier to

451
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,240
entry um again all the these kinds of

452
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,600
things are things that the MTL and Nano

453
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,240
have been trying to do as well to

454
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,320
provide more access and Facilities to to

455
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,080
to have new businesses that we can't

456
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,159
even imagine so it's hard to predict 40

457
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,919
years but we're there's going to be a

458
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,840
lot of things that we can't even imagine

459
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,440
today that we're going to have and then

460
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,480
then the biggest thing that runs across

461
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,840
all of this funding is

462
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,120
Workforce I mean if we continue the way

463
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,360
we are and I think that was brought up

464
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:49,240
today too that um computer science is

465
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,640
more attractive to many than Hardware is

466
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,039
but I think that it's all related and

467
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,840
when they don't see the promise of jobs

468
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,919
in the united they you know they go

469
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,799
where the jobs are and I think that this

470
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,440
is going to bring a lot of jobs back and

471
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,400
it's predicted that we continue at the

472
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,679
trajectory that we're on we will be

473
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,520
short 60,000 jobs by 2030 so we need to

474
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,240
change this and so a big part of this is

475
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,760
the Workforce Development initiatives

476
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,159
and

477
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,320
um I could I can go on about a lot of

478
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
things but I think my five minutes was

479
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,520
up a long time ago but I'm going to take

480
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,919
Jen's five minutes because I want to

481
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,120
also talk about Analog Devices and how

482
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,760
we have participated as Ry said this

483
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,240
morning we were founding members of of

484
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,960
the um MTL we're founding members of

485
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,200
Nano we find it's really important to be

486
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,679
working with um collaboratively like

487
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,440
this to you know make sure that they're

488
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,960
working on I mean I think there is that

489
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,200
feedback of we we get exposed to new

490
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,880
ideas but then the students get exposed

491
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,760
to what are the what's important out

492
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,200
there so um we've participated in the

493
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,200
Gan Consortium we participated in um

494
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,039
metrc and that's a really great one that

495
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,400
char

496
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,320
L and still leads um which is bringing

497
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,640
together again Academia industry and the

498
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,840
medical um field so we've participated

499
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,799
in a lot of those but I would say the

500
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,880
biggest benefit to ADI is not

501
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,159
necessarily the technology that we were

502
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,480
exposed to or that we learned but the

503
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,760
talent and I mean that was the hardest

504
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,480
thing for me to leave at ADI was there

505
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,240
many of them are in the audience too is

506
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,120
the talent we have amazing people that

507
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,679
that came from here CHR Jim are here

508
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,840
merik was here this morning I mean just

509
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,240
so many graduates and I know Ken I mean

510
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,080
just like everyone on the state and and

511
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,279
they may not stay at Analog although we

512
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,400
hope that they do they go all over the

513
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,279
over the world and you have

514
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,799
representation and that is truly two the

515
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,200
top two that's truly the the the

516
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,840
greatest thing that we get from our

517
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,120
participation in the MTL is the talent

518
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,840
so um we could talk more about the next

519
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,279
40 years but I think there's a lot out

520
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,159
there that we can be contributing and I

521
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:03,640
just just appreciate being able to share

522
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,640
this with you today thank

523
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,799
you yes I forgot to mention that Susan

524
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,400
agreed to uh represent uh Jen ly's

525
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,880
Viewpoint a little bit because she

526
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,880
couldn't make it um the next uh panelist

527
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:25,159
I would like to invite is um Keno again

528
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,480
because there is a file in this computer

529
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,640
when I asked Keno to be on the panel he

530
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,159
treated it like G gigantic homework

531
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,600
assignment and as was his habit when he

532
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,760
was a student here he worked until the

533
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:43,080
last minute so he kept uh sending us the

534
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,080
updated version until this

535
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,600
morning this is the most upto-date

536
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,679
version of assignment thank you thank

537
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:58,760
you Harry I know it's really good to be

538
00:24:51,679 --> 00:25:01,679
back uh at MIT uh it's and um really uh

539
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,919
you know of course I was um a student

540
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,720
when it was actually fairly early and so

541
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,880
I can go back and um if you uh look at

542
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,320
the uh the key Focus area for MTL uh in

543
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,480
the early years was actually mixed

544
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,120
signal Technologies and

545
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,360
circuits and now if you look at today uh

546
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,559
almost all new integrate circuits are

547
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,120
either mixed signal or analog and um you

548
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,520
know the founders

549
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,640
of the MTL really had great vision for

550
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,559
what the future is going to be and um of

551
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,720
course one of the people who contribute

552
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:44,399
to the uh this Vision uh was Stanis bus

553
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,120
uh from TI at that time and um actually

554
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:49,480
in

555
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,159
2018 he shared us a presentation uh

556
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,440
which entitled industry in transition uh

557
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:59,799
with me and um so in there he was

558
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,159
actually outlining what the uh next 30

559
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:05,000
years of the semiconductor industry

560
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:08,320
would be and um so that was a great

561
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
resource for me uh as I prepare this uh

562
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,360
presentation uh so this slide uh was

563
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,840
actually something similar to what

564
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Thomas showed this morning uh it's just

565
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,679
a different version and um so what this

566
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,440
slide shows is the uh energy uh that's

567
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,520
consumed uh in Jewels per year uh for

568
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,880
computation and communication

569
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:37,799
and uh what you see is that uh by year

570
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:40,480
2035 almost uh thir 50% of electricity

571
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,559
uh will be uh consumed by the

572
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,240
computation and communication if it goes

573
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,679
the way it's going right now and um of

574
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,159
course this is for the world and um so

575
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,720
if you look at uh you know what's

576
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,760
happening in developed countries this is

577
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,679
going to be actually significantly worse

578
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,440
and um so if you look at also this

579
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,640
plot if you look at the total electrical

580
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,640
energy generation it increases by about

581
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,600
3% a year and um this is something

582
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,200
that's been going on many decades this

583
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,799
is not something recent but it's just

584
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,520
been going on like this uh for many

585
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:20,679
decades and so what this means is that

586
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,360
we are going to pay a lot more for

587
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,440
electricity if this happens and of

588
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,360
course that will ultimately limit the

589
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:34,120
growth of um ICT

590
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:37,640
and um so our challenge is we have

591
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,279
to increase the uh the rate of Energy

592
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,039
Efficiency Improvement of course you

593
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,919
know

594
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,880
microelectronics improves Energy

595
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:49,679
Efficiency the scaling uh improves but

596
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,440
we have to increase the rate of um

597
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,799
Improvement so these are the things some

598
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,399
of the thoughts that I have that uh that

599
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,880
we should be doing and I think we are

600
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,440
already doing it right uh of course the

601
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,600
first is improve the Energy Efficiency

602
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,440
of computation itself there are uh I

603
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,399
think this morning and uh this afternoon

604
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,080
I saw many ideas about how that can be

605
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:17,399
done and um you know I think one of the

606
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,279
things that I've uh recently learned is

607
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:23,640
that just going from CPUs to gpus is

608
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,600
actually helping it's actually improving

609
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,159
the uh Energy Efficiency so that's

610
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,000
really good news and of course you know

611
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:35,159
we have amazing technologies that uh in

612
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,200
our uh portfolio and um going forward we

613
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,960
have to use the best of um the things

614
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,640
that we have so that we can uh improve

615
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,120
the Energy Efficiency faster and of

616
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,960
course that leads to heterogeneous

617
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,279
integration and of course that happens

618
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,399
right and then so if you think about

619
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,360
heterogeneous integration there all the

620
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,440
things but so many things that needs to

621
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:03,600
be done right um of course you know we

622
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,559
are all just odd by uh euv at this point

623
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,640
but we in 40 years we really do have to

624
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:13,640
think about what's going to be beyond

625
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:17,960
the 13.5 nanometer lithography and um so

626
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:21,200
last 40 years I our ability to image

627
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,240
things have um gone down by well

628
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,440
increased by factor of 100 right so you

629
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,919
know it's getting harder so you know if

630
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,080
you say it's factor of 10 in next 40

631
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,320
years we're going to be down in the

632
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,600
nanometer range and um so at that point

633
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,200
we're really not talking about nanometer

634
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,960
devices it's really atomic scale devices

635
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,519
that we're going to be dealing with and

636
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:51,679
um as suan mentioned you know we have to

637
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,440
do close disciplinary optimization of um

638
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,200
all levels and

639
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,960
um we have to account while doing that

640
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,799
we have to account for for

641
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,519
the and accounting or exploit the

642
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,559
variabilities uh that we have with all

643
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,600
uh our Technologies and also have to

644
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:14,640
worry about the mechanical thermal

645
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,559
electromagnetic and electronic effects

646
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,880
all these things have to happen at the

647
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,640
same time and so if you think about the

648
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,120
complexity that we'll have to deal with

649
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,799
it's

650
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,039
just mindboggling it's not just the

651
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,880
design but you also have to verify the

652
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:33,799
design you have to test the design and

653
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,080
you have to ensure the security of this

654
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,760
how about the reliability of this you

655
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,880
know you have 280 billion but now you're

656
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:45,360
going to have 50 of those in

657
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,919
the heterogeneous Integrated Systems how

658
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,240
are you going to assure the

659
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,360
reliability and um how about the power

660
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,559
delivery I think ultimately we're going

661
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:59,559
to be going toward 3D integration how

662
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:03,440
are I going to deliver power to this 3D

663
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,200
Integrated Systems and um of course I

664
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,039
think ultimately uh the rate of

665
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,080
generation of electric power electrical

666
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,360
power has to increase and so I think the

667
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,080
grid has to be upgraded and also uh

668
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,200
expanded and I

669
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,120
think obviously also the efficiency has

670
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,799
to be improved and I think that really

671
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,600
points toward the high voltage

672
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,600
semiconductors and I think that's going

673
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,440
to be a very important uh opportunities

674
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,559
for

675
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,639
everybody and

676
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,000
um because of these complexities that we

677
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:40,519
are dealing with ultimately the

678
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,200
heterogeneous integration will have a

679
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:46,960
limit on the complexity and the scale

680
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,200
and so beyond that we have to be

681
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,279
thinking about how I going to connect

682
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,360
these heterogeneous Integrated Systems

683
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:58,639
together to do something even bigger and

684
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,840
um of course the last thing is um

685
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:04,039
3D integration you know it's something

686
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,039
that we've been talking about for ages

687
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,440
uh and I think even when I was

688
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:11,080
undergraduate student people are talking

689
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,880
about 3D integration but we don't have

690
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,559
it yet and um what we really need is

691
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,000
energy efficient on chip and uh in

692
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:25,000
package Cooling and this can change the

693
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,399
whole picture and gee in 40 years you

694
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,480
know I'm not going to do it but you

695
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:32,600
should be able to do it

696
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,600
right so when I you know if you look at

697
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,080
what Dennis uh has actually put together

698
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,399
uh he talks about a fork uh for the

699
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,240
semiconductor industry and um so what he

700
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,480
was talking about is the fact that there

701
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,880
will be only few companies that will be

702
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,559
able to keep scaling which is true right

703
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,440
so we have about three companies that's

704
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:58,000
doing and um so the question is what do

705
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:02,200
other guys do and um so what he was

706
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,600
proposing is stop scaling uh of course

707
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:11,799
at uh 28 to 22 nanometer range in the in

708
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:16,039
the noes and um sorry can you wrap yeah

709
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:21,279
yeah yeah I'm done yeah and um so sorry

710
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:23,480
Harry so uh what he was talking about is

711
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,240
um rep

712
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,399
up

713
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:33,519
uh so stop scaling and then add more

714
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,639
functions into the integrate circuits so

715
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,120
talking about the heterogeneous

716
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,600
integration uh in order to uh solve

717
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,799
really the big problems uh for the

718
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,440
society and um you know we really do

719
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,919
have amazing set of Technologies and uh

720
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,880
we can do a lot more and if you actually

721
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,519
look at you know the past 40 years all

722
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,240
the things that I have not seen really

723
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,320
thought of when I was a graduate

724
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,840
students it has happened using just

725
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:10,240
existing Technologies I mean like the RF

726
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,839
RFC Moss uh it's one uh seos imagers and

727
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,520
I think you may always to argue that the

728
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,280
gpus was one of the things that actually

729
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,200
happened uh you know without really you

730
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,879
know the technology was not intended for

731
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,560
that and so I think there is a really

732
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:29,839
important thread of research along this

733
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,800
line and of course uh the other one is

734
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,280
you know what else can we

735
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,200
integrate uh with our Technologies so

736
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,000
that we can once again solve big

737
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,679
problems and um so you know things like

738
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,720
RF passive silicon fonics you know these

739
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,280
are the examples of what happened but

740
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,480
you know the things that will happen is

741
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,359
not on this uh chart but it's really

742
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,320
about the kind of way that you can think

743
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:01,119
about and what to work on and um I'll

744
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:05,359
finish by just saying that 40 years from

745
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:08,680
now somebody uh in this panel in this

746
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,760
future panel will mention this uh

747
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,920
something that came out along this

748
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,760
thread of um thought which is uh low

749
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:22,240
cost wafer scale and display panel scale

750
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,040
electronically s reflectors uh for uh

751
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,359
order of magnitude uh better efficiency

752
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,560
and of course this is something that

753
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,720
Professor uh Ronan h is working on at

754
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,800
this point but I think we need to make

755
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,880
it low cost and really make it scalable

756
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,880
and thank you for this

757
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,480
opportunity sorry

758
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,320
Harry all right I think I'll go with

759
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,040
Marcy last because she had zero time to

760
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,359
think little more time

761
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:56,800
I so I will go with Tom uh so we we're

762
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,760
going to have to change the um laptop

763
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,920
all right hopefully this won't crash the

764
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,800
system

765
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,640
so all right okay I'll just put it over

766
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,640
here

767
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,119
great so Tom mentioned this morning that

768
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,119
he prepared 45 minutes worth of material

769
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,200
so I hope he can condense it by a pack

770
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,960
it's only 200 slides how long can that

771
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,839
take it's uh it's always a dangerous

772
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:29,240
thing to give a professor microphone oh

773
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,240
yeah they never want to let it go

774
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,839
all right well I'm going to try to uh

775
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:37,880
slice up this a little bit differently

776
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,040
perhaps than um is normally done I

777
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,960
always inflict history upon my students

778
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,880
if you ask them they'll say with an

779
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,520
exasperated tone yes that's indeed true

780
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,720
but the reason for doing this is not out

781
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,720
of a nostalgic feeling for the past the

782
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,800
good old days allegedly uh it's really

783
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,400
because even if history doesn't

784
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,560
literally rhyme uh lit literally repeat

785
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,560
itself it certainly seems to rhyme a lot

786
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,720
so when you try to do the impossible

787
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,240
thing of predicting the future the best

788
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,160
we can really do is take a look at the

789
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,359
rhymes of the past and see what happens

790
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,599
if you consider that to be a motif that

791
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,680
will repeat in the future so first of

792
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,839
all mvin Kelly Marvin Kelly you in the

793
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,319
Old Country uh is someone who should be

794
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:19,680
on our T-shirts because we owe him our

795
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,400
jobs uh this is a case where one

796
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,359
Visionary person not only noticed

797
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,000
something about the track that history

798
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,920
was falling and didn't like it and did

799
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,760
something to change it he actually

800
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,560
successfully changed it uh so Marvin

801
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,599
Kelly was the head of bell labs when

802
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,160
Bell Labs was just forming and he

803
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,240
noticed that the number of technicians

804
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,520
for the AT&T folks was growing at an

805
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,200
exponential rate and he noticed in fact

806
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,400
that if he extrapolated the curve a

807
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,280
little bit more that by the year 2000

808
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,680
basically every adult in America would

809
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,760
have to be an AT&T technician and so he

810
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,640
thought that was unlikely and so he had

811
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,720
identified a scaling barrier to AT&T's

812
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,240
total dominance of everything so uh he

813
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,160
looked about for possible solutions and

814
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,720
the problem of course was

815
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,440
electromechanical relays and vacuum

816
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,640
tubes had limited lifetimes and uh there

817
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,319
was one slender existence proof of a

818
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,280
solid state device its operational uh

819
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,760
properties were not understood no one

820
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,680
knew Quantum really well enough to

821
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,839
explain these things but a copper oxide

822
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,640
rectifier was in use uh at Bell Labs or

823
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,480
actually in the T&T system and So based

824
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,880
on that tiny tiny uh existence proof of

825
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,240
a non-moving part thing that does some

826
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,079
useful signal processing he bet the

827
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:37,200
entire future of not only AT&T but us on

828
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,800
the solid state so he assigns a guy

829
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,040
named Bill Shockley the task of heading

830
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,000
up a group that's going to deliver what

831
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,960
would later be called the transistor so

832
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that's a to me that's a remarkable thing

833
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,560
my crystal ball is permanently broken

834
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,200
it's cloudy uh I have successfully

835
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,599
predicted uh the last 12 well 12 the

836
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,560
last two uh downturns so uh and that's

837
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,960
apparently typical but Marvin Kelly just

838
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,280
nailed it so it's pretty a remarkable

839
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,680
thing now was that a one-off well it

840
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,560
turns out that we can identify yet

841
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,319
another character with similar Visionary

842
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,119
Powers uh in the story of semiconductors

843
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:13,160
Bob Noy who is uh according to history

844
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,680
the co-inventor of the IC but he is the

845
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,599
inventor of the IC as it's currently

846
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,640
instantiated noise was making

847
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,400
transistors at Fairchild and he saw the

848
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,160
absurdity of building multiple

849
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,400
transistors on a wafer dicing up the

850
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,680
Wafers packaging up the individual dice

851
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,920
shipping them to customers who then

852
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,359
soldered them back together again it

853
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,000
felt an awful lot like a government

854
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,319
works project where you hire one group

855
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,760
to dig a ditch and another one group to

856
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:38,440
fill it up and you say yay uh and so he

857
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,400
thought of the interconnect problem as

858
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,200
being an important part of making

859
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,720
integrated circuits valuable he saw that

860
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:48,760
as a scaling limiter to be unlimited and

861
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,400
luckily he had in his employee Jean who

862
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,359
gave him the planer process which also

863
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,560
turned out to have solved the

864
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,760
interconnect problem for him so that's

865
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,240
why we have the 208 Giga transistor ic's

866
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,800
today it's because noise sort of

867
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,319
uniquely and before anyone else

868
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,839
recognized this would be a scaling

869
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:08,200
limiter saw that unlocking the power of

870
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,640
IC would require overcoming that barrier

871
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:13,240
and then overcoming it really remarkable

872
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,280
so here we have two examples in the

873
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,200
history of our business where it was

874
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,839
sort of one Visionary just looking out

875
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,880
into the future looking at scaling

876
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,200
problems and preemptively getting rid of

877
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,200
them so trying to channel the spirit of

878
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,440
both Marvin Kelly and noise what kind of

879
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,760
scaling challenges do we face today well

880
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,640
luckily we've already had two speakers

881
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,480
present curves that sort of speak to

882
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,119
that uh Professor Palos gave a curve and

883
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,400
good old Keno uh did the same thing if

884
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,960
you take a look at the scaling trends of

885
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,359
just CPUs as an example of what's going

886
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,200
on broadly certainly the transistor

887
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,240
count is growing so that seems to be a

888
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,040
sign that everything's well with with

889
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,760
Moore's law but if you read Moore's

890
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,800
paper very carefully he actually

891
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,359
mentions explicitly that the value of

892
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,560
doing this shrinkage only is sustained

893
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,960
by a diminution in the cost of the

894
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,839
transistor and that's no longer

895
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,960
happening the cost per transistor is

896
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,280
kind of flattened out since the finfet

897
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,599
days and that sort of saturation is

898
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,760
showing up in the single thread

899
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,520
performance of CPUs CPUs uh kind of

900
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,200
flattening there and we're trying to

901
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,640
compensate by giving it more and more

902
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,240
cores but if you notice this is parallel

903
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,200
to that curve so we're throwing more

904
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,800
core more transistors at cores but we're

905
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,640
not allowed to light up all the course

906
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,160
because the part would incandesce and

907
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,440
desolder itself from the PC board so we

908
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,319
have a problem here that's caused by

909
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,960
sort of the dinard scaling uh no longer

910
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,720
holding and at the same time that we're

911
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,680
delivering sort of less per

912
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,800
generation uh to the users of these

913
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,280
devices they're just demanding more of

914
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,319
the devices uh this is a a typical uh

915
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,599
plot showing the evolution of model

916
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:58,480
parameter number for deep Learning

917
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,640
Systems uh on the left it's hard to see

918
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,560
but the Top Line there is a trillion

919
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,720
parameters and that was passed by uh

920
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,680
what is this switch C at Google uh if

921
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,400
you try to fit a curve through this

922
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:14,160
thing this is a a logarithmic plot and

923
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,240
the best fit curve is an exponential all

924
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,440
right so if you're you my students

925
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,160
they've seen curves all the time it's

926
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,079
just too abstract for them so I say

927
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,720
imagine this is your bank account

928
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,119
balance they oh that would be good okay

929
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,680
now you got it so the growth rate here

930
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:33,200
is insane it's in this case it's 177,000

931
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,319
X every 3 years for the last segment of

932
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,400
that

933
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:40,240
plot and while our transistors are still

934
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,520
kind of transis the same as they have

935
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,559
for several Generations so this is a

936
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,040
problem so that's conspiring to produce

937
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,720
this curve which has been shown a couple

938
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,559
times but I'll add a couple fiducials to

939
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,400
the curve uh just to make sure that

940
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,880
we're calibrated on what the meaning of

941
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,960
these curves is the green curve is data

942
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,520
center power growth and it's nicely

943
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,640
following a factor of 10 slope every

944
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,599
decade the red curve is the uh amount of

945
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,440
electrical energy generated on the

946
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,760
planet and the gold curve is the total

947
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,760
amount of energy generated on the planet

948
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,839
so we're right here along this line here

949
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,440
and the major divisions here are two

950
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,400
orders of magnitude and energy so we're

951
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,559
in the sort

952
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,480
of approximately 10% of global

953
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,160
electrical energy being consumed by data

954
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,160
centers and it's on an upward slope so

955
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,480
if 10% doesn't make you frightened

956
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,880
the fact that that 10% is today and is

957
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,800
growing a factor of 10 per decade that

958
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,160
should concern you look at the first

959
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,240
derivative and not just the the base

960
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,040
value so and again just to calibrate us

961
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,000
uh to the reality that this cannot

962
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,280
continue much longer the total energy

963
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,480
received by uh the Earth received from

964
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,760
the Sun by the Earth is on the order of

965
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,400
10 to the 24th Jewels uh per year and

966
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,720
this is you know 10 to the 20th right

967
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,040
there so in mid-century if that curve

968
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:05,240
were to continue without bending over we

969
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,640
would need to consume all of the energy

970
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,160
incident upon the earth from the sun

971
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,440
that's including all the sunlight

972
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,880
hitting the oceans the poles everything

973
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,359
else yes I know the big Hook is coming

974
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,599
out very soon so so this is going to

975
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,920
bend over and the question is what's

976
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,359
going to make it bend over is because

977
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,960
you know humans wake up one day and say

978
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,920
we've got all the the the goodness we

979
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,240
need and compute when's that that ever

980
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,960
happen no uh or is it you know statutory

981
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,880
limitations on the consumption of energy

982
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,040
for compute like no Netflix on Saturday

983
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,880
is for you or or only wealthy people or

984
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,440
wealthy Nations or companies will be

985
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,800
allowed to compute so we don't want that

986
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,800
to happen so what's the existence proof

987
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,040
that gives us hope that there is a way

988
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,440
out of this yes we'll do all the things

989
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,240
that have mentioned we'll do process

990
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,839
things we'll do magic we'll do 3D we'll

991
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,280
do better heat pipes we'll do all sorts

992
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,040
of algorithmic tweaking and all those

993
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,040
things but the the effectiveness of

994
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,040
those tricks I argue will be very

995
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,200
limited because those are sort of linear

996
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:07,680
bandages trying to staunch a an

997
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,119
exponential blood flow so I think we're

998
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,839
going to have to look elsewhere we're

999
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,000
going to have to look out of the box now

1000
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:15,079
but there is an existence proof biology

1001
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,920
has given us the brain for example which

1002
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,480
is remarkable it's 20 watts okay uh

1003
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,480
politicians maybe a little less but

1004
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,000
overall about 20 watts and it consists

1005
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,079
of millisecond speed neurons these are

1006
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,599
dog slow

1007
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,400
things uh and yet it's um it's able to

1008
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,440
do many many things Google's very proud

1009
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,880
of imet where they showed it a 100

1010
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,640
billion pictures of cats and now can

1011
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,359
tell what a cat is that's not very

1012
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,160
impressive compared to my niece who at

1013
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:44,680
age three knew cat you know and we did

1014
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,720
not train her with a 100 billion

1015
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,319
pictures of cat she just new cat furry

1016
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,000
purs likes it you know has sharp claws

1017
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:54,359
got it it didn't need to see a bazillion

1018
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,160
example so there's something about

1019
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:58,559
biological brains that can do certain

1020
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,160
tasks very very efficiently using

1021
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,640
horrible resources it's meat-based

1022
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,280
technology for God's sake when I want to

1023
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,800
build something I don't reach for you

1024
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,359
know steak to build my circuits and yet

1025
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,599
somehow nature figured out a way to make

1026
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:13,800
that work so I use that as uh a data

1027
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,800
point that should also shame the

1028
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,640
engineers into working harder and

1029
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,280
smarter and also to give us hope that

1030
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,040
there in fact is a solution out of this

1031
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,040
box thank you

1032
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,440
uh last but not the least uh Marcy black

1033
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:35,200
I hope uh you can summarize your uh

1034
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,359
thoughts in it's literally true couple

1035
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,359
of

1036
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,720
minutes hi happy 40th birthday everyone

1037
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,200
um so tamas has a little bit of an

1038
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:51,880
accent right and so when he said um

1039
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:55,000
mtl's fabulous I thought he said mtl's

1040
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,079
family because we have we have such a

1041
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,839
good culture here and a good group group

1042
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:03,040
of people I I hope the next 40 years we

1043
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,119
continue that community of growth um so

1044
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,640
I wanted to comment a little bit because

1045
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,640
I figured people would comment on the

1046
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,640
research side more I wanted to comment a

1047
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,960
little on the other hat that MTL plays

1048
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,079
and the other role which is education

1049
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,800
and I'll mention a little bit of

1050
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:21,359
research at the end um so education is

1051
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,240
going to change a lot uh not in 40 years

1052
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,280
but in 10 years I'd say um with the

1053
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,280
expansion of AI like that just how is

1054
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,880
just exploding and with open education

1055
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,079
and so what that means is that it will

1056
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,599
free up it will change education and it

1057
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:41,520
will free up teachers and professors to

1058
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:44,280
teach in in a lot deeper way in a lot

1059
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,400
better way and I I think that a lot of

1060
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,040
the ways that education is going to

1061
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,480
change are going to make use of some of

1062
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:57,000
the areas that MTL and M is particularly

1063
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:59,240
strong at so for example um we have

1064
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,720
amazing professors here as as everyone

1065
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:05,760
knows um I did all three degrees here

1066
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,440
and I remember in particular uh several

1067
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,240
professors continued to Mentor me a

1068
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,839
couple in this room actually um and so I

1069
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,119
I think the importance of mentorship and

1070
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,960
one-on-one teaching and office hours

1071
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:19,720
like how many times that did you guys go

1072
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,839
to office hours and be completely

1073
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,319
clueless when you read the book and then

1074
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,680
the professor figured out what you

1075
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:26,640
didn't understand and was able to

1076
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,200
explain it to you so I think that type

1077
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,520
of teaching is going to become more and

1078
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:35,680
more important with the explosion of

1079
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,640
AI I also think um another area that MIT

1080
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,079
is very strong with is is our Labs we

1081
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:46,880
have this beautiful uh Fab that was just

1082
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:49,160
built and did this just okay um and um

1083
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,520
so that's gonna allow teaching to be

1084
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,000
more Hands-On which I think is very

1085
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,640
important um because you can read about

1086
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,839
it in the book but unless you actually

1087
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,640
do semiconductor processing you don't

1088
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,400
really understand how to do it um and

1089
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,359
also continuing to get students involved

1090
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,920
in R&D um all the way undergrad through

1091
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:11,559
grad I think is going to become more and

1092
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,119
more important um I also think MIT is

1093
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:16,240
particularly good at not just teaching

1094
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,839
material but teaching students how to

1095
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,319
think and I think I think that's going

1096
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:22,799
to become more and more important

1097
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,480
because frankly I have no idea where

1098
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:28,559
technolog is going to go in 40 years um

1099
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,480
but if someone is taught how to think

1100
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,720
they'll be able to learn how to do that

1101
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,319
and be able to to contribute to society

1102
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,359
um so I don't know if that means that

1103
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:40,920
education might change like maybe we'll

1104
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:43,680
hand students papers and ask them to

1105
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,480
critique it or maybe we will um give

1106
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,040
them a new innovation and ask them to

1107
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,680
brainstorm ideas of different

1108
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,880
applications for it but um I think

1109
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,720
teaching kids or our students how to

1110
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,480
teach is going to be continually

1111
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,440
important and I think MIT is very strong

1112
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:03,359
at that um another area that MIT is

1113
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:07,160
particularly strong at is our students

1114
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:10,720
and our diversity in in in who we have

1115
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,040
here um both internationally but also in

1116
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,359
expertise um like there was a couple

1117
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,559
slides that showed how we're number one

1118
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,760
in so many different technical Fields

1119
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:22,000
like that's just amazing that one

1120
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,400
University can be number one in so many

1121
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,319
different areas um so in addition to

1122
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,200
engineering and Technology we also have

1123
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,319
SL in the business school and so having

1124
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,040
all these expertise together in one

1125
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:35,599
place is really going to help

1126
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,160
cross-pollinate ideas and allow us to

1127
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,000
innovate better and I I think I've

1128
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,440
noticed in my career that a lot of the

1129
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,040
best ideas come from cross-pollinations

1130
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:48,680
across different areas in in stem but

1131
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:51,040
even outside stem um and um my career

1132
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,920
has been focused on entrepreneurship so

1133
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,160
having exposure to the business school

1134
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,520
and the entrepreneurs Club really helped

1135
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:01,440
me in in my career

1136
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,680
um so on the R&D side

1137
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,040
um my advice to students is always to

1138
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,520
focus on the problem and I feel like I I

1139
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,000
think it's interesting how we all pick

1140
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,480
some of the same problems so the things

1141
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,880
that I see as some of the bigger

1142
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,440
problems in the near future are energy

1143
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,880
health care and defense um and I just

1144
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,680
wanted to and and all of these really

1145
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,359
need Microsystems and semiconductor

1146
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,000
development like all of them like

1147
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:29,119
they're they're a large part of those

1148
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,040
problems are going to be solved by the

1149
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,400
people in this community and in similar

1150
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,839
communities um but I wanted to spend

1151
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,240
just a minute on biosensing and the

1152
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:40,200
healthcare because that's what my

1153
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,079
company event silicon work group works

1154
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:46,760
on um so we're developing a silicon ship

1155
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:49,319
that can measure proteins uh in a very

1156
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,920
very rapidly and very low cost and I

1157
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:55,599
think um biosensing in general is really

1158
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,520
going to revolutionize how we see

1159
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,520
Healthcare and well

1160
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,240
I I think it's absolutely ridiculous how

1161
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,839
little we know about our own bodies um

1162
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,599
but in the very near future I think

1163
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:10,240
we're going to have access to daily

1164
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,559
measurements of how our body is doing

1165
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,680
and and tell us everything from oh

1166
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,400
you're starting to get sick to you drank

1167
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:19,880
too much last night or uh you need to

1168
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,559
hydrate or you need electrolytes like

1169
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,079
there there's so much information that

1170
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:27,119
we're literally just throwing down the

1171
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:29,680
toilet every day so I I see um

1172
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,520
biosensing and silicon ships is being

1173
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,880
able to really impact our our healthc

1174
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:39,040
care and and well and wellness um so

1175
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,079
with that I I to summarize I I think a

1176
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:45,280
lot of the areas um that are going to be

1177
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,040
needed in both R&D and education I think

1178
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,480
MTL and MIT um in addition to MTL are

1179
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,400
very strong at and so I I look forward

1180
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,920
to seeing what the community does in the

1181
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,920
next 40 years

1182
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:05,400
all right let's uh give another uh round

1183
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:09,200
of of Applause to the

1184
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:12,200
panelist so I did prepare a few

1185
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,400
questions uh but I think uh since we

1186
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:17,880
don't have a whole lot of time left uh I

1187
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,680
would like to invite questions from the

1188
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:24,319
audience um I think uh probably the best

1189
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,000
way at this point is for you to raise

1190
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:31,430
your hands and then yell

1191
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,430
[Laughter]

1192
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:36,799
I would like the the uh live questions

1193
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,799
first

1194
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:44,040
yeah I've been thinking today speakers

1195
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:46,200
Tom summarized it well few ago about how

1196
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,040
um it's becoming ridiculous the amount

1197
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,440
of energy that we're using for computing

1198
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,640
and communication and we've also

1199
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,640
mentioned today how a lot of our

1200
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,599
industry um came from the inventure of

1201
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,760
the transistor

1202
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:00,520
of new

1203
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,079
revolutionary um history break invention

1204
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,480
that we can come up with to totally

1205
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,000
change this you mentioned the brain is

1206
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,480
being an example is there any way we can

1207
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,319
replicate that without actually needing

1208
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,079
stakes and stuff to our company um I

1209
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:15,440
don't know yet but I've spent the last 5

1210
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,240
years uh trying to translate the

1211
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,520
Neuroscience literature into terms that

1212
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,680
are understandable to me that's been a

1213
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,599
long slog but I I found a a person who's

1214
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,400
bilingual she actually has a PHD in uh

1215
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,400
in circuits and changed her career from

1216
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,200
Imaging the brain to actually studying

1217
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,920
the brain itself and fixing broken

1218
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,839
brains so she's been my Ally my

1219
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,920
dictionary who's been helping

1220
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,119
me she steered me to the right

1221
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,480
literature and then translated the weird

1222
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,280
verbiage that they use into oh Vehicles

1223
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,079
IR they're talking about M's law now I

1224
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,599
got it um

1225
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:53,799
the stuff I've been able to abstract

1226
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:55,400
from that is that the brain is not

1227
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:57,680
something that I can reduce to

1228
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,240
transistors in the kinds of circuits

1229
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,960
that we use um it's as far as I can tell

1230
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,880
it's really an analog machine that has

1231
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,240
within it um spatial reasoning engines

1232
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,720
which makes sense from an evolutionary

1233
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,559
point of view you need to be able to map

1234
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,119
out just your space around you and then

1235
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:16,280
the uh evolution of higher level

1236
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,240
thinking just exapted that existing

1237
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:21,520
Hardware to do metaphorical places and

1238
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,480
so information processing is really just

1239
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,119
metaphorically moving from one room to

1240
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,920
another or combining different spaces

1241
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,280
together and so when you start to think

1242
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,520
about that as the model of computation

1243
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,280
then you end up with very different

1244
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,000
structures and so we've been pursuing

1245
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:38,160
them we're we're taping out our first

1246
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,760
test chip this January maybe um to test

1247
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,440
out pieces of that to see if the Energy

1248
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:46,160
savings doing certain tasks are what

1249
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,240
we're hoping for but it's it's all very

1250
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,920
spective I expect to be wrong many more

1251
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,400
times than we get it right but we we

1252
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,880
feel like we're on to something because

1253
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,400
we've been able to sort of take some

1254
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,119
insights from evolutionary biology make

1255
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,920
them together with other stuff

1256
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:02,640
interestingly enough from two different

1257
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,520
domains here at MIT from gome Chomsky

1258
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,400
who showed that we have an inborn

1259
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:10,079
Universal grammar engine and um max

1260
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,119
tegmark who I think wrote the most

1261
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,039
important AI papers that no AI

1262
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,960
researchers have read uh he showed that

1263
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:21,520
you can do symbolic uh regression much

1264
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,440
more efficiently using um his methods

1265
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,000
which don't just do machine learning the

1266
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,319
normal way uh he found out that if you

1267
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,960
just give it the biases that humans have

1268
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,599
we believe in the beauty of nature

1269
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,200
that's just a a poetic way of saying

1270
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,160
that nature obey certain symmetry laws

1271
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,119
if you use those symmetry laws as

1272
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,599
pre-filters to prune your neural net he

1273
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,240
was able to use the original data from

1274
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,680
350 years of physics when people just

1275
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,400
looked out the night sky and figured

1276
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,200
things out using that original data he

1277
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,480
was able to reproduce 100 equations of

1278
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,680
physics fundamental equations in physics

1279
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,240
and from the original data and often

1280
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,640
times using fewer than 10 data points

1281
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,839
it's really quite remarkable so he took

1282
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,520
an NP hard problem added this very very

1283
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:06,920
simple pre-filter and it went from

1284
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,319
impossible to genius uh it's really

1285
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,680
quite amazing I think there's a lot of

1286
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,799
that that we've got inbuilt and

1287
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,720
sometimes those biases are unhelpful but

1288
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:17,160
uh but a lot of the efficiencies that we

1289
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,000
attribute to Mom magical biology bits is

1290
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:23,079
just really um preconfiguring the brain

1291
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,319
to prefer things that obey certain

1292
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:27,640
asymmetry principles so we're taking

1293
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:30,599
advantage of those in go to uh the

1294
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,839
question uh from Pigeon Hall uh what is

1295
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:35,039
the best way to transfer the skills and

1296
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:37,119
knowledge from retiring Workforce to

1297
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:38,799
younger generation do we have enough

1298
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,200
younger people showing interest in

1299
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:44,240
semiconductor Hardware who wants to uh

1300
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,880
take that question I I can just add that

1301
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,319
I have a lot of trouble hiring uh

1302
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,280
semiconductor experts um in particular

1303
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:55,760
those with uh that

1304
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,839
have um what's the right word approval

1305
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,960
to work in the US so it's it's a big

1306
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:03,599
challenge it' be interesting to hear

1307
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,280
from the folks in Academia and what what

1308
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,240
is the trend is it is it changing with

1309
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,960
the promise of manufacturing coming on

1310
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,319
Shore and the investment that the US is

1311
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,720
making yeah it is anecdotal but the

1312
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:18,240
classes that deal with circuits and and

1313
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:21,200
semiconductors uh the enrollment uh

1314
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,920
enrollments have gone up it could be

1315
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:27,560
temporary uh but at least the the the

1316
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,190
the derivative is

1317
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,190
[Laughter]

1318
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:35,280
positive yeah I was shocked we we've

1319
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,400
seen a doubling in the enrollment and

1320
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,039
Hardware classes uh in the LA over the

1321
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,200
last three years and I don't know if

1322
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,359
it's a one-time blip but it's it's held

1323
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,920
for three years running uh it's actually

1324
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:46,480
straining our resources because we we

1325
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,039
had been shrinking the amount of space

1326
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,799
available for lab classes to respond to

1327
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,880
the previous signal where the slope was

1328
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:54,200
negative and just as we were doing this

1329
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,799
all of a sudden you now now we're

1330
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,440
cramped so students are contending for

1331
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:59,079
res course that's a good problem to have

1332
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,359
relative to the previous one but still a

1333
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,119
problem but hopefully it continues to

1334
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:05,319
sustain at this higher level I mean we

1335
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:07,400
we see the same thing at the

1336
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:09,559
undergraduate level uh for us at The

1337
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,799
Graduate level it's different because of

1338
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:14,200
the uh you know we rely heavily on

1339
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:15,839
International students and it has been

1340
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,039
actually difficult for a lot of

1341
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,960
international uh students to come to the

1342
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:23,839
United States in the past few years uh

1343
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,920
but in the undergraduate level we see a

1344
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:29,440
great deal of excitement among students

1345
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,359
I think that there's the the it

1346
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,160
semiconductors a lot it's the awareness

1347
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,680
that we talked about that you know

1348
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,599
semiconductors are going to transform

1349
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,599
our future and I think that and the

1350
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:42,520
promise of jobs in the United States so

1351
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:44,440
I think that I do think it's not going

1352
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,799
to be a blip I think that there's a

1353
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,000
shift and more folks are going to and I

1354
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,880
think that some of the Workforce

1355
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,520
Development initiatives that we we're

1356
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,039
going to have for the chips program are

1357
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,559
going to help that because we have to

1358
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,400
reach back to you know stem education

1359
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:59,319
and see it all the way through and track

1360
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,640
these and I going around the country

1361
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:04,240
there are so many different programs

1362
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,559
that I see for Workforce Development and

1363
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:09,440
I think we just need to share the

1364
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,559
learning amplify the ones that work I I

1365
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,760
think there's a lot for you know

1366
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:17,960
training young people and um retraining

1367
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:21,760
older people so I think it's I see a

1368
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:26,760
positive trajectory here uh let's um

1369
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,760
invite a question from the live audience

1370
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:34,720
or even the comos

1371
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,960
audience take them all this may be a

1372
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,280
silly question but between humanoids and

1373
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:43,200
AR glasses what do you think will hit 1%

1374
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:48,000
adoption in the US first what is the

1375
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:50,720
question what the two AR glasses and and

1376
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,839
humanoids I didn't humanoids humanoids

1377
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:57,920
we have about 10 companies that have

1378
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:57,920
developed humanoids um prototypes

1379
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:04,039
that's a hard question because part of

1380
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:08,799
that is not technology it's it's uh

1381
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:11,039
human behavior so

1382
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:14,359
you it's hard to say because we we have

1383
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,480
a large robotics lab that we just funded

1384
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:20,359
and we had a big uh inaugural ceremony

1385
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,720
in fact and you know I sort of pinged

1386
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:23,119
people as they were walking away from it

1387
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,520
they all thought it was really neat and

1388
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,119
then when I asked the second question so

1389
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,720
would you want these in your home answer

1390
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:30,119
was almost universally no way and I said

1391
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,200
why not well I have kids I'm worried

1392
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,079
that these things will go berserk you

1393
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,079
know didn't just e Terminator you know

1394
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:38,440
they they think it was a documentary and

1395
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:41,280
so I I think that's the the sort of bias

1396
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,000
that may be overcome but I have no idea

1397
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,559
how long that takes I mean something you

1398
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,720
know the right

1399
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:49,359
movie perhaps change U people's thinking

1400
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,760
overnight but I have no idea I've been

1401
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:56,000
horrible at predicting social trends you

1402
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:58,200
know we cannot predict anything anyway I

1403
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,319
can't I absolutely can't I've proven it

1404
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,520
over and over

1405
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:04,599
again all right the uh timer is showing

1406
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,640
a red blinking light that means that we

1407
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:09,559
went over time Susan is nervously

1408
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:13,240
looking at her watch CU she has a pright

1409
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:15,200
to catch so um let's uh thank the

1410
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:18,960
panelists for their wonderful view

1411
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,960
points and presentations
