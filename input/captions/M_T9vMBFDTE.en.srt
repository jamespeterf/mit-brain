00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
Hi everyone. Um, thank you for joining

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,319
the Renee Salazar speaker series hosted

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,559
by the Latinx at Broad Affinity Group at

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,800
the Broad Institute. My name is Adana

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,559
Nves. Um, and I have the pleasure of

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
welcoming our speaker, Dr. Julian

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,560
Abilacho. Um, and before the

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,160
presentation, I would like to talk a bit

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,480
about the Latinx community and our

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,800
special collaboration with out at Broad.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,800
So the Renee Salazar speaker series is

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,199
meant to highlight researchers within

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,199
different scientific fields and

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
disciplines, foster collaboration,

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,040
highlight role models for from varied

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,559
personal and professional backgrounds,

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,920
give opportunities to network and

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,760
promote research. So we're really

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,879
excited to have you all here and learn

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,640
from one of our very own. Um, following

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,120
this mission, we created the Latinx

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,280
speaker series with the purpose of

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,800
building community amongst broadies as

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
well as offering opportunities for

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,640
connection, learning, and belonging. So,

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,559
we hope that you feel the vibes here

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,399
today. Um, before we kick off, this is a

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,399
special collab with Out at Broad. So, I

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,640
will give it to my collaborator Julian

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,439
Pausnak just to give us a bit intro on

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,119
out at Broadro. Thanks so much. Uh, I

32
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,240
won't take up too much time. I just

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,560
wanted to say how uh grateful we are to

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,040
be uh partnering with Latin X at Broad

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,799
for today's session. Um when we were

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
planning for Pride Month, we thought it

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
might be really nice to uh reach out to

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,280
a whole bunch of different groups and

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,960
collaborate and Latin exit broad um

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,360
immediately came to mind especially for

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,159
their speaker series. uh we've been

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
looking to dive into scientific

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
presentations more ourselves and we

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,040
thought that this was a perfect

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,920
opportunity to uh dip our toe in that

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,439
pool so to speak. Um, and as we started

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,320
thinking about who might join us, um, I

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,119
connected with, uh, Julian Aila Pacheco

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,600
a while ago, um, for those of you who

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,920
don't know, not only is he one of the

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,000
broad senior scientists, but uh, he was

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,799
also one of the original co-founders of

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,840
Outit. So, we thought that this was kind

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,479
of a perfect opportunity for us to uh,

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,239
partner on this. And personally, not

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
only has he really been um a great

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
mentor in helping me and the rest of the

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,120
out at Broad steering committee think

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,400
about what we might do and what the

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,920
group uh how the group can help members

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,560
of the out community at Broad. Um but he

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,239
was also um

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,200
he's also just been immensely supportive

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,800
of of what we're doing. So uh without

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,840
further delay, I'll let him take it

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,680
away. Yeah. Before we get started, I

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,680
just want to like um highlight the

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,640
agenda for today. So, and give a little

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
bit of a bio on Julang A. Um so, Julang

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,080
Abil Pachka is a senior research

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
scientist in the metabolomics platform

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
at the Broad Institute of MIT and

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,440
Harvard where he works under the

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
direction of Clary Kush. His research

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,959
interests lie in developing methods for

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
the analysis and interpretation of

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,720
metabolomics data generating generated

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
using liquid chromatography, tandem mass

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,879
mass spectrometry. A key focus of his

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
research is discovering and

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,800
characterizing novel metabolites

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
associated with a broad range of

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
disorders such as inflammatory bowel

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,599
disease, metabol metabolic disease and

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,080
cancer. Um, Julang actively collaborates

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,760
in numerous metabolic uh profiling

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
projects within the institute and the

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,319
external community. Today Julian will be

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
talking about GABA arginine, a novel

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,440
brain metabolite associated with

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,080
survival in tubercular menitis patients.

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,400
Um after the talk we'll give it about 15

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,319
minutes for a Q&A and the chat will be

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,920
open for folks to engage. So without

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,920
further ado, welcome Julian Abacho

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,879
and and both thank you Adriana and Julie

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,799
and I I it's it's really nice to to get

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,720
invited to give this talk. have been

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,280
involved with out and and shades in

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,159
different capacities over the past what

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,640
like 10 years since we got involved in

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,200
getting out of room started and so it's

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,920
really nice to see like the efforts to

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,799
just have a space for us to get together

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,840
and share our work. Um

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,640
uh can we switch the to my slides now?

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,159
I'm still seeing the All right. Well,

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,480
thank you everyone for for being here uh

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,000
today. Uh I'm happy to share this story

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,759
we have been working on at the

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
metabolomics platform in the broad

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,639
institute. Um I don't know how familiar

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,800
everyone is with with the platform. Uh

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,720
so I I figure I would give you a small

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
introduction of who we are and where we

116
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,160
are compared to many groups at the

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,040
broad. We're relatively small group. We

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,520
are around 1920 people now. and and

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,680
primarily we have um scientists who are

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,120
in the lab running this instrumentation

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,040
to generate data at at at a at scale. We

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,280
also have a small team of software

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,720
engineers developing tools to process

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,440
the data, QC it, visualize it, organize

125
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,000
large amounts of information and we have

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,440
a small admin team of of one person. Uh

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
there are also a couple scientists

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,160
currently working on on expanding our

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,919
imaging mass spectrometry efforts and

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,639
identifying compounds which will be the

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,080
the topic of today's talk. Uh we used to

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,560
be in the American building in the

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,800
seventh floor but now we we we are in

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,600
Beanie Street in the third floor. Uh we

135
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,280
moved last February. We expanded our

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,039
footprint. So now we have this beautiful

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,000
lab space you're seeing there on the

138
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,840
right. Uh so if you feel like you would

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
like to come by and visit and learn more

140
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,440
about what we do, please let me know. We

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,800
would love to have you and give you a

142
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,199
tour. Uh so I'm just going to jump right

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,440
into what we do in the in the platform.

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
And and I appreciate this talk is it has

145
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,000
a broad audience. So the way I structure

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
it is we're going to go into a very

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,199
general um introduction to the

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,919
technology we use to smell sorry measure

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,360
small molecules or metabolites

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,000
and and hopefully we'll we'll all get on

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,600
the same page as to how we we do what we

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
do. Uh so if you're an expert in LCMS

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
please bear with me. So what we do in

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
the platform as metabolomics may

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,479
indicate is is measure small molecules

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,080
of metabolites. Um our our primarily

157
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,240
primary primary focus is to measure uh

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,880
samples biological samples obtained from

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,600
from primarily humans but we also have

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,840
samples obtained from animal models uh

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,440
cell cultures either ukarotic or

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,240
bacterial

163
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,440
uh tissues media and sometimes we

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,039
profile uh different samples that uh

165
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,600
don't fall into these categories.

166
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,160
profile in the past tense like beer and

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,639
juice and and different different

168
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,680
things. Uh and then we have an

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,400
analytical methodology that primarily uh

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
relies on liquid chromatography uh

171
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,960
coupled to high resolution mass

172
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,800
spectrometry and we use that to generate

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,080
those uh measurements and we'll go into

174
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,479
more detail into how we do that in the

175
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,840
next couple slides. In the platform we

176
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,680
also do some very simple um analytical

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,440
statistical analysis on the data we

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,759
generate. Uh we do all of the data

179
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,680
processing and generate uh sort of

180
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,240
completed data sets that are then shared

181
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,919
with our collaborators so they can date

182
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,520
then take that data and and just do

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,560
different things with it. Primarily

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,960
trying to find uh associations of small

185
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,800
molecules with disease. try to discover

186
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,800
perhaps molecules that may help you

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,599
predict uh the onset of of disease. Uh

188
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,280
classify patients or samples based on

189
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,360
those metabolic phenotypes try to

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,479
understand the mechanisms behind

191
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,120
disease. Uh figure out drug activity and

192
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,720
efficacy and in general discover new

193
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,400
metabolites that may help us understand

194
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,319
disease and that that's where where I

195
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,199
come in. Uh traditionally the work we've

196
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,120
been doing in the platform uh focus on

197
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,360
these large cohorts uh where uh we're

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,560
trying to identify metabolites that may

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,680
help us u predict disease or understand

200
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,840
the early symptoms of of someone

201
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,160
developing a particular condition. And

202
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,080
to do that we rely on this collection of

203
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,960
longitudinal cohorts. There are many out

204
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,440
there where where uh participants are

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,240
recruited, samples are biobanked, could

206
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,000
be plasma, urine, tissues, and then

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,080
they're followed up over the spans of

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,360
years, sometimes decades, and sometimes

209
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,960
generations. So you can essentially look

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,479
in back in time and see in a population

211
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,639
for those people who develop a

212
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,479
particular condition test to see if

213
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,800
there were any metabolites that were

214
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,360
more abundant or less abundant that

215
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,719
could help us predict and diagnose u

216
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,800
disease before it actually um happens.

217
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,120
So with with this we have to date

218
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,240
profiled over 40,000 individuals from

219
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,920
from these cohorts and the interesting

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
thing is that many of these cohorts have

221
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,880
additional layers of of omic data. So

222
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,680
they're many of them have exom

223
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,440
sequencing. So in addition to generating

224
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,519
uh the measurements of so small

225
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,360
molecules we have access to the genetic

226
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,080
background of each individual. So we can

227
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,240
start integrating uh different types of

228
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,080
information to understand sort of the

229
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,680
the complexity of disease in a more

230
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,160
individual individualized way.

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Now since it's a broad audience uh I'm

232
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,480
just going to go with a very uh simple

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,920
introduction to uh metabolism and how we

234
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,160
measure metabolites. So I I assume that

235
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
most people who are in the seminar right

236
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,320
now are familiar with the work we do in

237
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,839
the institute. uh there's quite a bit of

238
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,760
uh genomic uh transcrytoic work uh so I

239
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,760
wanted to frame metabolism and small

240
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,480
molecules within this central dogma

241
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,399
which is the concept of DNA in the

242
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,120
nucleus of the cell being transcribed

243
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,760
into RNA which is then translated to

244
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,800
proteins and those proteins are act

245
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,279
enzyatically on on substrates which are

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,080
small molecules and and the proteins are

247
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,720
usually uh converting different uh

248
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,920
molecules into different uh molecules

249
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,480
that are necessary for central

250
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,080
processes. So we can start from sugars

251
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,320
and then break them down to generate

252
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,959
energy or we can start from sugars and

253
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
uh make some fats and proteins and and

254
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,760
other components that make us who we

255
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,040
are. So so I like to see this as as just

256
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,640
small binding blocks metabolites and I I

257
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,720
used to love playing with Legos when I

258
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,360
was a kid. So I do really like this this

259
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
analogy. uh seeing metabolizes as just

260
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,720
building blocks that make up essentially

261
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,399
everything in in a biological sample. Uh

262
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
and the question that we often get asked

263
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
is how many metabolis are are there?

264
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,920
Because if you if you think about it, it

265
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,800
it's relatively easy to estimate how

266
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,920
many genes you may run into a human

267
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,279
genome that are at least coding for uh a

268
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,360
particular protein. Uh and you can also

269
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,839
start looking into how many transcripts

270
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,120
you can detect at a given time. in in a

271
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,160
cell type or a tissue. And it gets a

272
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
little bit more complicated when you

273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,079
start looking at the potential universe

274
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
of variance you have in proteins,

275
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,839
protein isoforms. And if you add

276
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,839
modifications to those proteins, it

277
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,839
starts getting really complicated. And

278
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,760
when you get to metabolizes, I would

279
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,160
argue a little bit more complicated than

280
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,240
that. So according to the human

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,680
metabolum database which is a pretty

282
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,839
comprehensive uh database that tries to

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,760
index all the possible metabolites that

284
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,399
you would expect to see or that have

285
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,200
been detected in human biofluids. There

286
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,720
are about 200,000 potential human

287
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
metabolites

288
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,160
with about over 40,000 that have been

289
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,640
referenced or or described as detected

290
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,040
or quantified in human bofluids.

291
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,200
So that's quite quite a few. But in

292
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
reality, uh if you think about

293
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,560
metabolites, they're small molecules.

294
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040
And we're not only thinking about the

295
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,040
small molecules that your body is making

296
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,640
via transcription protein activity,

297
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,360
endogenous metabolites, but you're

298
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,839
thinking about compounds that you may be

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,040
getting exposed to either because you

300
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
are consuming them in your food or drugs

301
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,440
or maybe because you're getting exposed

302
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,839
to them as in pollutants or chemicals

303
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,680
that are in things you put on your body.

304
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,680
And it gets even more complicated when

305
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,880
we think about the variability of

306
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,200
bacteria in your stomach, on your skin,

307
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,680
and the contributions of those metabolic

308
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,360
activities that may transform molecules

309
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,560
that we're expecting to see in someone

310
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,360
into new molecules that we may not know.

311
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,040
Uh so that expands the universe of

312
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,240
potential molecules that you could

313
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,639
detect. And if you weren't to see how

314
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,839
many rearrangements of different atoms

315
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,519
of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen,

316
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
uh the numbers start ballooning

317
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,279
significantly and you could start going

318
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,800
to like potential millions of

319
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,320
combinations of different um arranges.

320
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,959
Not necessarily that you would detect

321
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,440
all of these in a bofluid but it's a

322
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,279
potential universe based on like where

323
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,760
are you are where you are what you're

324
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,480
consuming and what compounds you may see

325
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
in someone in a population. So that

326
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
that's sort of the question of what are

327
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,320
metabolites where do they come from u

328
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,279
the next question is how do we measure

329
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,160
them here in the metabolomics platform.

330
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,160
So, so the the the great challenge with

331
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
measuring metabolites is unlike

332
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,839
sequencing and unlike other

333
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,760
technologies, um there is no universal

334
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,560
way to measure all of the metabolites

335
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,120
under the sun. And to complicate this

336
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,440
even more, we have metabolites that can

337
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,920
be found in a sample at very very small

338
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
concentrations at the same time as other

339
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,360
metabolites are present in super high

340
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
concentrations. So that's called a

341
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,040
dynamic range. you have to have a

342
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,600
technology that lets you measure very

343
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,160
small amounts but also just really great

344
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,880
concentrations of them. And the next I

345
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,800
would argue most challenging part of it

346
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,200
is that small molecules vary

347
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,440
tremendously in their physical and

348
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,959
chemical properties. Uh and I think

349
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,199
everyone is familiar with this. There

350
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,040
are molecules that are very sticky,

351
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,360
non-polar. They don't like water like

352
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,959
lipids, fats, cholesterol. And they're

353
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
molecules that are water soluble.

354
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,279
they've been solved very easily such as

355
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,279
sugars, amino acids. So those different

356
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,199
characteristics makes them really hard

357
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,199
to measure at the same time. So usually

358
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,920
we have to generate different analytical

359
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,199
methods that lets us cover the broad

360
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,920
range of chemical classes uh and cover

361
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,360
their metabolism. I would argue that

362
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,920
although many labs that measure

363
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,199
metabolisms have a variety of methods to

364
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,440
measure all of them, usually there are

365
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,040
areas of the chemical space that are

366
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,120
very hard to detect no matter how many

367
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,560
methods you have. So even though we're

368
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,920
measuring we're claiming to measure

369
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,680
everything everything that's possibly

370
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,240
observable, there may be things that are

371
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,480
always left um behind.

372
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,639
So the way we measure uh metabolites

373
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,199
here in the platform is using liquid

374
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,639
chromatography and mass spectrometry. I

375
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,399
imagine many of you have heard

376
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
chromatography from this like

377
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,800
experiments that I think every kid or at

378
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,760
least hope every kid would uh would do

379
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,079
in school where you have a collection or

380
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,720
a mixture of different dyes and you spot

381
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,279
them on some filter paper and you put

382
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,519
them in water or alcohol and then the

383
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,000
the the solution as it moves through the

384
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,720
paper starts pulling those pigments

385
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,199
apart and separating them based on their

386
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,600
ability to interact with the with the

387
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,440
paper which in this phase would be the

388
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,519
stationary phase and and their affinity

389
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,920
for the mobile phase or the liquid in

390
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,440
this case is uh dictated by their

391
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,040
chemical characteristics. So we take

392
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,680
advantage of that same principle except

393
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,760
we don't have paper in the in the

394
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,240
instruments we use. We instead use these

395
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,320
columns of material that has been

396
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,040
tightly packed in it that has chemical

397
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,800
properties like the paper that are

398
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,120
designed to interact with certain

399
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,040
molecules based on their uh chemical

400
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
properties and they're packed in these

401
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,040
metal columns because then we are going

402
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,199
to push these liquids faces at

403
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,279
incredibly high pressures to to make

404
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,440
sure they separate as much as possible

405
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,079
and they're resolved as as best as

406
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,920
possible. And I'm showing you this like

407
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,759
industrial size column. But in reality,

408
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,519
these are very thin and very narrow. At

409
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,120
least the analytical columns that we use

410
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,759
routinely. Uh so in essence, a package

411
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,839
of of molecules extracted from a sample

412
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,480
will enter this column, get pushed with

413
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,959
a mobile phase and based on its ability

414
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,440
to interact with those beads uh and the

415
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,079
the chemical on it, then they will get

416
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,600
separated. And the ones that stay in the

417
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,040
column for the longest period of time,

418
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
they're more attracted to it. And the

419
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,839
ones that come off first or elute first

420
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,240
are the more attractive to the solvent.

421
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,560
Now I added a more realistic example of

422
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,079
this. This is a silica particles. So

423
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,839
those tiny beads are covered in silica.

424
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,079
And if you had a combination of these

425
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,399
types of molecules where those like

426
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,720
benzene ring containing ones that eluded

427
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,560
first would be pretty hydrophobic and

428
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,560
not able to interact with the silica

429
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,120
really well. So those would come off the

430
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,440
column first. And the other ones which

431
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,520
have like this nitrogen uh element in

432
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,679
them would be able to interact with the

433
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,000
silica with higher affinity and would

434
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,400
take longer to get out of the column and

435
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,559
and that essentially gives us uh the

436
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,559
concept of the retention time. So

437
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,039
molecules that are coming off the column

438
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,640
really fast in this case very early are

439
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,799
molecules that did not interact very

440
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,120
well with with the column and then

441
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,120
molecules that elude later are molecules

442
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,440
that were bound tightly to the column.

443
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,600
And then by switching those model faces

444
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
to something that they like better, they

445
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,280
come off the column and they elute

446
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,400
later. So the first dimension of

447
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,400
separation we have when we run a complex

448
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,799
mixture of compounds is the

449
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,600
chromatography phase.

450
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,799
The next part uh well no before the next

451
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,360
part uh so if you're running a very

452
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,559
complex mixture let's say in this case u

453
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,760
a plasma sample uh the reality is that

454
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,760
we have many many many molecules in a

455
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,960
plasma sample that will interact very

456
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,640
similar to to each other and will get

457
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,799
retained very similarly. So in reality

458
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,880
we have many many molecules that maybe

459
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,640
is different in size but chemically

460
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,120
they're very similar. So end up coming

461
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,320
off at the same time. So we still have a

462
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,600
pretty messy mixture of compounds here.

463
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,679
So retention time chromatography is not

464
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,280
enough for us to just characterize

465
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
everything that is in a sample and

466
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,799
separate it fully. So that's where mass

467
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,360
mass spectrometry comes in. So mass

468
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,400
spectrometry uh it is a technology that

469
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,240
requires molecules to be ionized. And in

470
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,919
the lab we rely heavily on on this

471
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,480
particular technology of mass

472
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,960
spectrometers that has uh an orbit trap

473
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,280
analyzer. It looks kind of like that in

474
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,760
the palm of your hand. The instruments

475
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,039
look like this. They're these big boxes

476
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,720
uh so take up quite a bit of room. And

477
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,200
we have currently about 15 that that

478
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,960
rely on this technology. Um they there's

479
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
been like several iterations of this.

480
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
They're very creative with the

481
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,960
nomomenclature. Oh, it's just Q Exactive

482
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,039
plus a bunch of different names. And

483
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,640
we're currently transitioning to sort of

484
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,640
a newer platform called Explorers 240.

485
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,520
And we have one of those committed to

486
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,320
imaging as well at the moment. And we

487
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,280
have uh in comparison only four

488
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,760
instruments that uh unlike this orbit

489
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,679
trap technology are using a different

490
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,080
type of profiling to measure compounds.

491
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,840
the targeted instrumentation uh that

492
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,160
right now we're using for very specific

493
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,799
applications but but most of the studies

494
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,240
that I've that I mentioned before they

495
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,000
have they're being acquired with this

496
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,039
technology that I'm going to describe in

497
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,360
very general terms here so this cartoon

498
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,880
representation would be sort of a

499
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,880
cross-section of these one of these

500
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,000
machines u not all of them are designed

501
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,240
this way uh but the idea is as the

502
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,840
compounds are eluding from your column

503
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,760
the the ones that are interacting with

504
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,000
it poorly will come out first the ones

505
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,640
that get tightly bound in um elute

506
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
later. So you have this package of of

507
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,280
compounds that are eluding in the

508
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,160
solvent. So they're in this liquid phase

509
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,520
and they get to the stage where there is

510
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,440
a u a process where they get ionized and

511
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,360
they get vaporized. So there's a

512
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,440
technology here where there's energy

513
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,919
being applied to them. There's heat that

514
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,320
vaporizes the molecule. So the molecules

515
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,840
pass from being in liquid to being in

516
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,600
gas and forming ions. So getting charged

517
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,880
and this machine essentially what it's

518
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,480
doing is using just this electromagnetic

519
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,679
fields and this uh rods charged rods

520
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,200
called um quadruples or um yeah

521
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,360
quadruples primarily. Let's leave it at

522
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,760
that. Uh so they're guiding all these

523
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,200
charged molecules through these optics

524
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,200
and then they're sending them to the

525
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,440
orbit trap analyzer which is a detector

526
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,360
that does a couple things. It does one

527
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,320
thing. It separates all of this package

528
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,880
of ions based on Mars 2 charge and then

529
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,200
it gives us the abundance of each one of

530
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,440
them. That's critical because I

531
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,960
mentioned as these uh packages of

532
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,120
compounds are coming off the column you

533
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
still have a pretty complex mixture and

534
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,440
as they enter the mass spectrometer the

535
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,240
mass spectrometer is able to separate

536
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,559
them based on their size and then is

537
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,880
able to tell us how much of each one of

538
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,200
those it found. So as as this process is

539
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,760
is coupled and and happening, you start

540
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,400
having compounds that are coming off and

541
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,320
you start seeing signals, mass to charge

542
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
signals separated every time the

543
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,720
molecule is coming off and you start

544
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,360
plotting their intensities. Uh you start

545
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,919
getting these like nice profiles for for

546
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,080
the peaks and and this happens over the

547
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,039
span of a whole run which in our methods

548
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,880
is usually anywhere between 16 to 30

549
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,520
minutes.

550
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
and and that's and essentially you end

551
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
up getting something like this. This is

552
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,360
just the same representation. This is a

553
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,919
real real file obtained from profiling

554
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,840
stool and it would be this uh peak map

555
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,080
that I'm showing you here observed from

556
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,400
above. So each one of these like little

557
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,400
dots and speckles would be one of those

558
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,120
features that the masspec was able to

559
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,440
resolve as the compounds were coming off

560
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,400
the the column. And there could be many

561
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,080
of these uh in stool we can get 20,000

562
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,720
to 40,000 of these peaks and and all of

563
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,559
them ideally they're not necessarily

564
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
true but the majority of these come from

565
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,240
compounds and molecules that were found

566
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,159
in this sample. So the next question

567
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,600
would be well how can we tell what they

568
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,440
are? Uh so there are two main steps

569
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,240
these are sort of a gold standards to

570
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,120
figure out what the compound may be. The

571
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,559
first one is we have to buy a compound.

572
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,400
We have to get a compound to uh test

573
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,320
first of all if it interacts the same

574
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,039
way with the column the the liquid

575
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,880
chromatography column we used and if

576
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,039
there is a match for the compound the

577
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,120
mass to charge of the molecule has to

578
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,760
match the retention time of our unknown

579
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,799
in the sample. And there's a second

580
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,080
dimension to uh annotating these

581
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,640
compounds which is we need to break down

582
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,640
the molecule and look at the fingerprint

583
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,919
that it generates to make sure that

584
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,480
whatever molecule or whatever known peak

585
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,480
in the sample matches that unique

586
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,640
commercially available standard we we

587
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,880
have. What does that mean? Let's say we

588
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,480
have two molecules. Uh these two

589
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,280
molecules for instance have the same

590
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,919
formula. We're just rearranging the

591
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,760
little elements in it in different uh

592
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,400
configurations. They're called isomers

593
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,520
because of that. And going back to the

594
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,919
Lego example, you may have different uh

595
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,440
units that you could break by applying

596
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,840
some energy. And this fmentation I

597
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,200
showed you is capable of doing this. And

598
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,679
and this energy will break the molecule

599
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,919
in different patterns based for based on

600
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,120
each individual uh structure that you

601
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,200
have. And that's because some of the

602
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,520
substructures may be more stable in some

603
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,000
molecules than in others. So let's say

604
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,120
in this case you have one that will

605
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,720
produce this um fragment at 10. But this

606
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,440
molecule over here may fragment

607
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,679
differently and generate this uh product

608
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240
ion spectrum that is different from this

609
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,120
one. So in a way we like to think of

610
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,960
this as a fingerprint for each

611
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,039
individual molecule. And you could use

612
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,039
this information to figure out how the

613
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,360
pieces come together, but also you could

614
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,000
use it to confirm that the molecule

615
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,000
you're actually working with is indeed a

616
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,480
match for that signal, the mass

617
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,240
spectrometer. So,

618
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,720
so the whole point of this talk is just

619
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,440
to highlight the the importance of

620
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,520
identifying these compounds and the the

621
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,559
way I describe this process, it it is

622
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,320
very expensive. It is time consuming uh

623
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,320
and it's primarily biased towards

624
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,880
metabolites that we already knew about.

625
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,320
So think about amino acids, sugars,

626
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
carnitines, everything you may have seen

627
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,600
in your biochemistry books when you took

628
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,679
biochemistry.

629
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,360
Uh but that in reality is just a

630
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,039
fraction of all these thousands of

631
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,679
thousands of signals that you could run

632
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,440
in in a in a in a sample. And you could

633
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,919
think about many of them being quite

634
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,159
rare because maybe this person traveled

635
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,960
to Mexico and ate something that we

636
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,039
didn't have here and ate something that

637
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,120
you would never expect to see in the

638
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,919
human metabolum database or maybe even

639
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,480
pumpkin. So the question is how do we go

640
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,120
about uh characterizing those molecules

641
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,760
and how why is is there a point in

642
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,880
trying to do so? So so hopefully I will

643
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,640
convince you at the end of this talk

644
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,120
that it is something worth investing in

645
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,360
and something worth looking into.

646
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,440
All right. So you're all experts now in

647
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,679
liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry

648
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
and metabolomics. So I'm just going to

649
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,400
go now into the topic of the talk which

650
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,679
is tuberculosis menitis.

651
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,840
So tuberculosis menitis is a type of um

652
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,840
menitis which is just inflammation of

653
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,960
the meningas. And if you're not familiar

654
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,679
with the word meningis is is the lining

655
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,640
of of your brain and your spine. It it

656
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,799
is a very important region of the brain

657
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,679
that sort of regulates the movement of

658
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,480
cerebral spinal fluid. It sort of acts

659
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,400
as a barrier to control what comes into

660
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,640
contact with the brain and protects the

661
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,480
brain. It's a very unique ecosystem in

662
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,440
your body. So the inflammation of the

663
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,679
meninjas causes all sorts of different

664
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,480
symptoms that you don't want once it is

665
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,200
uh swollen or inflamed and and this

666
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,360
disease is caused by uh mcoacterium

667
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,919
tuberculosis which you may have heard of

668
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,440
it as causing uh pneumonia attacking

669
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,400
primarily the lungs but TB is is is just

670
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,960
really it's really incredible of a

671
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,279
pathogen and it can uh occur in many

672
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,919
other places other than the lungs lungs

673
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,679
it can it can infect different tissues

674
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,120
in the body and the brain is one of

675
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,320
them. And and while the brain infections

676
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,720
are not as common as the pulmonary, uh

677
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,360
they are quite bad once people get them,

678
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,760
especially bad in in young children and

679
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,039
individuals infected with HIV. You could

680
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,360
understand that, you know, within a

681
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,559
compromised immune system, this is quite

682
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,799
quite a bad outcome. And even even

683
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,640
though it can be cured in some cases,

684
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,640
this still has a pretty high mortality

685
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,360
rate, much higher than pulmonary

686
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,600
tuberculosis. And even if it is treated

687
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,279
and cured, it usually leaves at least

688
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,279
half of the survivors with with

689
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,039
permanent squella permanent

690
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,360
complications.

691
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,760
Uh and the additional challenge is is

692
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,000
that it's just really hard to diagnose

693
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,640
it. you patients usually present to the

694
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,080
clinic with very very general symptoms

695
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,880
like fever, headache, feeling sick uh

696
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,279
usually for a long period of time and to

697
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,600
get a full full comprehensive diagnosis

698
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,760
you have to sample the CSF uh and to get

699
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,799
the CSF is not easy. you usually have to

700
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,039
go into your spine and do a tab uh which

701
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,200
is quite invasive and sometimes the

702
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,200
person is so ill you cannot do that and

703
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,159
even when you have the CSF you have to

704
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,559
either grow it to see if TB grows or you

705
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,399
have to do some PCR testing which is

706
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,320
sometimes not sensitive enough to find

707
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,919
it because you you don't have an out of

708
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,520
control infection in the CSF you

709
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,600
probably have fewer cells in there um

710
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,840
and the other thing is causes all sorts

711
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,840
of weird symptoms so it's really hard to

712
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,440
if you see a patient to say is this the

713
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,240
course of treatment for it. So treatment

714
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,159
is often delayed making it really hard

715
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,679
and I'm showing this case that I run

716
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,480
into uh that was uh reported for a 24

717
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,399
year old uh man in Pakistan someone who

718
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,120
had been having headaches for 3 months

719
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:40,000
and finally came to the hospital after

720
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,960
uh suffer from uh neck stiffness and

721
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,720
started having seizures. So he went to

722
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,799
the clinic and they couldn't really

723
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,600
figure out what was going on. did a PCR

724
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,120
on sputin blood to see if there was TB

725
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,279
or any other infections. It all came

726
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,720
back negative. When they did an MRI,

727
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,039
they did see this like um really uh

728
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,880
these ring lesions in the brain as well

729
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,039
as somewhere here in the spine which is

730
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,960
quite bad and there's inflammation as

731
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,559
well in in in the in the spine. So at

732
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,360
the end of the day it was not confirmed

733
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,120
that this patient had TB but because of

734
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,840
these characteristics the person was

735
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,919
given a cocktail of four antibiotics and

736
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,000
improved quite a bit. So the assumption

737
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,880
was that TB was the cause for these

738
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,399
symptoms and these uh nodules. The

739
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
patient responded positively, was

740
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,480
discharged. But even after three month

741
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,600
and six month follow-ups, this patient

742
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,440
was still moving in crutches, still had

743
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,880
a catheter because could not um uh could

744
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,760
not control uh urination. So, so what I

745
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,640
was trying to do here is just illustrate

746
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,279
how this is pretty debilitating. is hard

747
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,200
to diagnose and even though the the

748
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,520
response to treatments is sometimes uh

749
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,520
appropriate, it can leave uh lasting

750
00:29:51,520 --> 00:30:00,480
consequences in people. So we uh and by

751
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,320
we I mean Clary uh almost 10 years ago

752
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,799
uh got involved in in starting this

753
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,640
project and I just wanted to tell the

754
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,880
story of how this project came to be

755
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,039
because in the platform we work with

756
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,440
collaborators uh in many different

757
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,600
spaces and people often ask us how how

758
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,200
do I work with you? How do I get to do

759
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,440
this really cool work and and this is an

760
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,279
example of how this happened. So uh

761
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,799
Ronnie Xavier which many of you are

762
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,279
familiar with he works in the infectious

763
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,200
disease and microbiome program he had

764
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,600
some collaborators at this university in

765
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,000
the Netherlands Rodba University and

766
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,679
these collaborators had collaborators of

767
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,480
their own there and one of his

768
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,320
collaborators of theirs uh is this uh

769
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,360
doctor infectious disease physician

770
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,679
Rhina Vancrievel. So through this

771
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,039
collaboration he learned about us uh

772
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,840
about the work of Clary and the

773
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,360
metabolomics platform and he reached out

774
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:57,360
to Clary and asked hey we have this very

775
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,799
interesting cohort of uh TBIS patients

776
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,960
and in Bandung Indonesia and we would

777
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,960
like we have this hypothesis about this

778
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,600
family of molecules that we believe are

779
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,200
disregulated in people with TB menitis

780
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,520
in the CSF we believe there's this

781
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
immune misregulation that is killing

782
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,240
people. So we would like to uh use

783
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,720
metabolomics to answer that question. At

784
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,799
the time there was no funding. So Clara

785
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,240
said, "Well, we never profiled CSF."

786
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,080
Hopefully I'm not misrepresenting what

787
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,880
actually happened. You can correct me if

788
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,159
I'm wrong. Uh uh we had never profiled

789
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,559
CSF with the methods we have. Not sure

790
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,399
we'll be able to do this. So let's try

791
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,279
to get these samples and try to profile

792
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,519
them and see what what we find. So we

793
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,519
had this this catalytic pilot project

794
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,200
where we got a subset of samples and

795
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,480
this these are the characteristics of

796
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,600
those samples. Uh it was a small set of

797
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,240
uh controls. uh and the controls are

798
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,880
subjects who uh presented to the clinic

799
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,080
with with with symptoms but after doing

800
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,880
the testing and the the culture of of

801
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,279
the CSF they were found not to have

802
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,480
bacterial menitis or microacterial

803
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,720
menitis as well as uh 15 samples from TB

804
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,279
menitis patients who survive after

805
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,679
treatment and 17 of those who did not

806
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,399
survive. And then there was another set

807
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,399
of samples that that we profiled that we

808
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,159
deemed the validation cohort for for

809
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,840
some of these findings in the first set

810
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,159
of samples.

811
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,640
H so we collected uh four LCMS profiling

812
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,559
methods. In this case, we we use uh

813
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,000
three different types of chromatography.

814
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,760
Uh so now you're all experts in

815
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,919
chromatography. The ones I show you were

816
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,919
were helic essentially. But we have

817
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,559
other types of chromatography that are

818
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,840
good at resolving uh uh compounds that

819
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,399
are very uh uh lipidy, very very

820
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,120
non-polar, such as lipids and fatty

821
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:54,080
acids. And and then there's different

822
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,919
ionizations that that track uh molecules

823
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,279
that are more likely to ionize in

824
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,360
positive mode and some that are more

825
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,480
likely to ionize in negative mode. From

826
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,039
this effort, uh, there were 351

827
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,279
molecules that were able to annotate

828
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,240
after removal of some of them that did

829
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,679
not pass QC's. And the first thing I'm

830
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,000
showing you here, this is work that was

831
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,640
done by one of at the time, one of the

832
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,200
um the trainees at Robot University,

833
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,720
Arian Vartan Hovven. So he he was a

834
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,480
medical trainer u doctor there and he he

835
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,360
was the one who one who analyzed this

836
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,519
data. So here I'm showing you a PCA

837
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,039
which is essentially trying to capture

838
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,080
the contribution of all of those

839
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,159
metabolites and how they help separate

840
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,720
the samples that we profile. So each one

841
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,760
of these squares or dots represents one

842
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,960
patient and the ones in green are people

843
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,120
who uh were the controls that we used

844
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,600
and over here in blue and red we have

845
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,679
the TV cases the the CSF or the timing

846
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,360
menitis people and you can see there's a

847
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,440
separation between those two. So that

848
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,080
was really encouraging. Made it think

849
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,840
that out of these 351 metabolites we

850
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,360
profiled, there were differences

851
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,399
pronounced enough to tell those groups

852
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,279
of groups apart. And then you just do

853
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,399
some universe statistics to try to uh

854
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,919
then see how the levels of each

855
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,359
metabolite, in this case each one of

856
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,480
these bubbles is represents one

857
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,359
metabolite, how they're changing. And

858
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,760
what you can see here is that on the

859
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,839
right are metabolites that are increased

860
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,639
in the CSF of sick people, people who

861
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,399
have menitis and on the left you see the

862
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,320
ones that are low. And from looking at

863
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,639
this you can see like oh wow there's a

864
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,800
lot that is just increasing out of

865
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,200
control in the CSF of people with TB

866
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,760
menitis and and the the current

867
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,000
hypothesis uh is that the reason why

868
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,079
we're seeing so much in the CSF of

869
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,240
people with menitis is because that that

870
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,720
blood brain barrier the meninjas are

871
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,879
swollen and that is compromising their

872
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,879
ability to filter molecules and

873
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,200
determine what makes it to the brain and

874
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,359
what doesn't. So those are not super

875
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,680
interesting but but the the the the

876
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,320
other thing that Arian did is he he then

877
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,720
started looking at survival and and sort

878
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,760
of stratified all of these molecules

879
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,079
that are either high in TBM or low in

880
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,520
TBM. And we added another dimension and

881
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,400
looked into like what is high in

882
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,839
survivors and what is low in survivors.

883
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,359
And the first thing that you see and

884
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,760
this is known clinically because the

885
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,839
glucose is pretty easy to be measured is

886
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,800
that glucose drops dramatically in the

887
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,800
in the brain of someone with TB menitis

888
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,119
and non-survivors tend to have lower

889
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,920
glucose levels. There was another

890
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,839
molecule called lucotryan B4 and

891
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,079
lucatryan B4 is just essentially a cell

892
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,000
sorry a molecule produced by your immune

893
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,800
system or your white blood cells and

894
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,200
it's kind of a flare that attracts the

895
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,200
migration of of other immune cells and

896
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,440
it causes triggers more inflammation and

897
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,160
more of an immune response. So not

898
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,320
surprisingly uh people who have menitis

899
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,160
have much higher levels of this and even

900
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,440
those those who don't survive have even

901
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,160
higher levels of it. And the one finding

902
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,240
that was completely unexpected and novel

903
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,040
for this study was tryptophan. So

904
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,560
tryptophan is an essential amino acid.

905
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,079
That's that means it's an amino acid

906
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,119
that we cannot make and we have to

907
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,760
consume. And and what was interesting is

908
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,960
that it has this like paradoxical

909
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,760
uh change where you have a little bit

910
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,640
lower of it in tib menitis but people

911
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,040
who survive have much lower levels than

912
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,160
those who don't survive.

913
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,000
uh and this uh was validated with that

914
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,880
larger cohort that I show you first. And

915
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,079
this right here is is a survival plot or

916
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,079
capliner curve where you can classify or

917
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,320
stratify the patients in that population

918
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,040
into people who have high levels of

919
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,599
tryptophan here mean intermediate levels

920
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,800
of tryptophan or low and you can see how

921
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,720
they do over time. And as this line

922
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,960
drops, what that's telling you is that

923
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,440
the probability of their survival drops

924
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,359
dramatically over time, especially if

925
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,000
you have a high amount of tryptophan in

926
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,760
the brain. So sometime you're benefiting

927
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,160
from having really low tryptophan and

928
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,440
thus helping you survive. So the current

929
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,760
hypothesis that we have is that

930
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,040
tryptophan is very important in immune

931
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,359
function. It gets broken down rapidly

932
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,200
immune system stimulation by this enzyme

933
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,760
called IDO.

934
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,760
And in part what that does is depletes

935
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,000
tryptophan. So you drop the tryptophan

936
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,800
dramatically and you manage to do that

937
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,760
you may limit tryptophan access to the

938
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,320
microacteria which usually infects uh

939
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,640
cells intracellularly. So the idea is

940
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,560
that you may be having an increased

941
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,040
immune response in these people who have

942
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,400
low tryptophan but you would may also be

943
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,560
starving TB in some way. Uh and this was

944
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,839
at the time a pretty novel observation.

945
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,680
Nobody had reported that. uh in in

946
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,880
addition to that we had some genomic

947
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,400
information. So we had um many of the

948
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,640
patients in this study or the

949
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,839
participants of the study had their exom

950
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:04,000
sequence I believe uh and we were able

951
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,920
to find 11 uh lossi or like regions in

952
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,880
the genome that were associated with the

953
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,040
levels of tryptophan and we found that

954
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
most of those were primarily in in cells

955
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,440
and brain tissues immune cells and brain

956
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,160
tissues which makes sense and if you

957
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,040
make a score combining all these genomic

958
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,839
locations you can classify people in

959
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,240
into those who do really poor and

960
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,880
genotypes for those who do much better.

961
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,520
So what what we did here is integrate

962
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,400
the results of metabolite levels and

963
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,440
individual genetic variation that may

964
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,760
contribute to having better outcomes

965
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,599
after a TV infection. Oops. I see where

966
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,839
okay we still have some time. All right.

967
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,040
So because of these findings, because of

968
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,359
that small catalytic project, we

969
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,800
actually uh were able to secure funding

970
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,599
into uh NIH funded grants to that sought

971
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,359
to expand this work and include more

972
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,680
participants and generate more multiomic

973
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,839
layers to understand this variability in

974
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,960
the response to treatment uh and

975
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,359
outcomes in TB. And we added a couple of

976
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,280
additional sites, one in Jakarta and

977
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,760
there were a couple of additional team

978
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,160
members added the University of Oxford

979
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,880
and the Oxford University Center for uh

980
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,119
clinical research in Vietnam. Uh so that

981
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,200
now we have two additional cohorts or

982
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,800
one additional cohort uh of Vietnamese

983
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,960
patients with TB menitis. And this is

984
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,640
what that cohort looks like. uh there's

985
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:38,320
now about almost a thousand participants

986
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,320
and we are working on getting some of

987
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
this data out there. Uh there's already

988
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,880
two publications. One is currently in

989
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,560
press. We're starting to see different

990
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,520
metabolites and their contributions to

991
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,560
TB menitis. But the the point of this

992
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,240
talk and in the last 10 minutes of it uh

993
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,400
I just wanted to go into the story of

994
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,440
how we found this new molecule that had

995
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,920
now been described in CSF. So what I

996
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,079
described so far was this collection of

997
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,880
annotated compounds that is are higher

998
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,640
in the CSF of people with tibmenitis.

999
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,640
But in reality if you look at all the

1000
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,960
signals we measure in the sample that we

1001
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,880
cannot annotate you see that there are a

1002
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,320
lot of signals that we're leaving behind

1003
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,400
that are quite significant. They're

1004
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,800
probably higher in TV but also lower in

1005
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,280
TV. And if you look at tryptophan, which

1006
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,280
is located over here, uh there's one

1007
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,520
over here in green that is much better

1008
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,320
in terms of having probably better fold

1009
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,440
changes and more robust associations

1010
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,240
with TB that we decided to pursue and

1011
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,640
we're calling that TF21.

1012
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,040
Now TF21 is associated with uh TB. So

1013
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,200
it's much lower in subjects with TBI

1014
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,520
menagitis. And now we have a much bigger

1015
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,240
cohort in from Indonesian and Vietnamese

1016
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,160
patients. So this means that this

1017
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,440
observation is validated in two

1018
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,760
different populations and this molecule

1019
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,760
is also associated with survival. It is

1020
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,680
much lower in people who don't survive.

1021
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,520
And if you look at the survival plots,

1022
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,000
interestingly for both the Vietnamese

1023
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,480
and the Indones Indonesian cohorts, the

1024
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,119
abundance um those subjects who have

1025
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,839
very low levels of this molecule have

1026
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,400
increased mortality but or probability

1027
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,800
of uh mortality but those who have

1028
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,880
medium or high levels do pretty similar

1029
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,200
to each other.

1030
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,040
So we are in this quadrant. So there

1031
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,800
very few the only molecule that we have

1032
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,160
in this quadrant was glucose. So it was

1033
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,400
very interesting for us to try to figure

1034
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,440
out what is this unknown molecule that

1035
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,359
is going down in TB menitis and is also

1036
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,920
going down in non-servivors. Is there

1037
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,720
anything protective about it?

1038
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,760
So in addition to that we we have some

1039
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,599
associations of this unknown molecule to

1040
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,640
uh clinical characteristics. So it's a

1041
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,560
molecule that is associated with immune

1042
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,720
uh anti-correlated with immune function.

1043
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,560
So somehow we believe that the levels of

1044
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,280
this molecule are dropping off as an

1045
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,839
immune response or inflammatory response

1046
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,319
is kicking in.

1047
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,680
Uh all right. So then how do we go about

1048
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,319
trying to figure out what this unknown

1049
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,560
is? So the first thing we do is break

1050
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,800
the molecule down like I told you uh

1051
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,720
before in that intro slide and this is

1052
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,839
the fragmentation that that molecule

1053
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,680
produces. We can also isolate one of

1054
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,200
those fragments that it produces and

1055
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,200
then generate more subfragments for it.

1056
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,040
And then essentially it becomes sort of

1057
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,440
a riddle where you have all these pieces

1058
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,319
that the molecule is making and then you

1059
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,040
have to put back together the structure

1060
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,200
of the molecule. Uh and we use this

1061
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,599
tool. is sort of a machine learning

1062
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,160
informed tool where you can give it all

1063
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,480
these fragments and it tries to create a

1064
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,000
fragmentation tree to to help address

1065
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,079
that puzzle and then tries to see in in

1066
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,400
all these candidate molecules in a

1067
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,480
database in this case Popkin figure out

1068
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,200
how many of them may explain the

1069
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,760
fragmentation tree and then we have to

1070
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,920
buy them to try to confirm that the

1071
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,920
unknown TF21 matches them. And the thing

1072
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,440
is these are quite expensive and I I

1073
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,119
just wanted to show you how much they

1074
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,720
are because this is one of the bigger

1075
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,319
limitations in trying to do component

1076
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,200
identification. So just buying those

1077
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:15,440
molecules was over $10,000.

1078
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,520
So to try to tackle that we've been

1079
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,520
working with uh Connor Kolius group and

1080
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,920
there's an initiative to try to generate

1081
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,800
better training data for these models

1082
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,119
and try to uh

1083
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,640
improve our ability to rank and predict

1084
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,319
these matches so we can save ourselves

1085
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,280
some time and some money in trying to

1086
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,560
predict them and even even scale it up.

1087
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,640
So these are the results of that

1088
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,640
validation. uh on the left the first

1089
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,400
step I told you we had to do which is we

1090
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,160
run the compounds and then we confirm

1091
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,160
they come off the column at the same

1092
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,440
retention time as the unknown. So this

1093
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,119
is the peak of interest in CSF and then

1094
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,760
we can break down the molecule and make

1095
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,240
sure that the the fragments match the

1096
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,920
the fragment of that unknown in the

1097
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,200
sample. So the one molecule that

1098
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,240
actually match was this GABA arginine.

1099
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,359
So GABA is a a neurom modulating

1100
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,760
molecule. I don't know if you've heard

1101
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,440
of it. is called gamma aminobuteric acid

1102
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,520
and it corresponds to the green part of

1103
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
the molecule here and arginine

1104
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,280
corresponds to the other part of the

1105
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,720
molecule. Arginine is an amino acid that

1106
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,960
I hope you're familiar with. So we then

1107
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,960
asked when when you find something novel

1108
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,800
we try to say is where is this found? Is

1109
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,599
this found only in the brain? And

1110
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,599
luckily we have some materials from a

1111
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,000
different project where we had profiled

1112
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,640
a collection of tissues in animals part

1113
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,160
of this uh project trying to understand

1114
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,560
the the molecular signatures of exercise

1115
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,200
and and and we have all of these uh

1116
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,520
different tissues that we profiled. And

1117
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,520
just to summarize this, I I can tell you

1118
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,440
that we see the peak of interest that

1119
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,200
corresponds to GABA arginine primarily

1120
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,760
in three tissues. The cortex, the

1121
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,480
hippocampus and hypothalamus indicating

1122
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,280
that this molecule is just primarily

1123
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,960
detected in brain tissues which is quite

1124
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,440
quite interesting since it is found in

1125
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,760
the cerebral spinal fluid.

1126
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,000
Then we started asking well what could

1127
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,839
this molecule be doing and the easiest

1128
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,359
thing for us to do since we had the data

1129
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,720
is try to correlate it to other

1130
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,520
molecules and see what these other

1131
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,319
molecules do. So what we found is that

1132
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:20,079
it's anti-correlated with u a collection

1133
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:23,119
of carnitines and asocarnitines uh and

1134
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,440
we knew from other studies in TB menitis

1135
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,000
that these carnitines are disregulated

1136
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,000
in TB menitis pointing at a

1137
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,079
mitochondrial dysfunction. So carnitines

1138
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,160
are intermediate steps in in the

1139
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,319
breakdown of fatty acids to generate

1140
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,800
energy and they start to build up once

1141
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,280
you have uh mitochondrial dysfunction.

1142
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,839
So somehow gaba arginine is the opposite

1143
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,280
of this process indicating that perhaps

1144
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:50,560
it is being um produced or perhaps it is

1145
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,000
dropping when there's oxidative stress.

1146
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,079
Funny enough or not funny but

1147
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,079
interesting enough it was not correlated

1148
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,599
with arginine levels even though we

1149
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,079
believe arginine is part of its

1150
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,079
synthesis. And then looking at the

1151
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,720
molecules it was very well correlated

1152
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,040
with uh we found that it was uh very

1153
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,920
well correlated with homocarnosine homos

1154
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,880
serin which uh not coincidentally enough

1155
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,520
but uh are actual deptides as well of

1156
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,640
GABA with in this case histadine another

1157
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,720
amino acid and GABA and methylhistadine

1158
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,880
and that is very interesting because

1159
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,599
these two have been studied in some

1160
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,280
detail homocarnosine

1161
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,040
even though the the evidence is a bit

1162
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,200
shaky in my opinion There's some

1163
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,839
evidence indicating homo carnosine may

1164
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,560
be a neurom modulator.

1165
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,359
It is found like gabarogenine primarily

1166
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,800
in in the central nervous system perhaps

1167
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,640
gabaragic neurons and there's some very

1168
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,280
small pilot studies where it's shown

1169
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,240
that supplementation with homocarnosine

1170
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,160
may prevent seizures. So that maybe

1171
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,000
gives it an idea it gives an idea of

1172
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,040
perhaps gabaragginine being involved in

1173
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,960
a similar process. Uh the other line of

1174
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,960
evidence we have from these two

1175
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,680
compounds that have been studied is that

1176
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,079
they have this uh histadine this um

1177
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,960
emitazol containing ring and that makes

1178
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,720
them uh potential antioxidants. They're

1179
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,200
highly abundant their homologous

1180
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,359
versions are highly abundant in muscles

1181
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,560
and and brain tissues. So they're

1182
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,720
thought to be of antioxidant properties.

1183
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,599
Uh and for these family compounds we

1184
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,599
know what enzymes are making them. So we

1185
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,960
suspect the symptoms may also be making

1186
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,800
up argin. But the reality is that I

1187
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,040
don't know what it does. So I can't tell

1188
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
you what it does. But it's very

1189
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,520
interesting because you opening up all

1190
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,839
these possibilities for us to study what

1191
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,960
it may be doing and how it may be

1192
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:46,480
involved in survival in TV menitis.

1193
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,720
While these two molecules were this one

1194
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,400
was lower in TB menitis, gabardinine is

1195
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,040
the only one that is actually associated

1196
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,000
with survival. uh makes makes it making

1197
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:01,839
it something special and perhaps unique.

1198
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,880
So to summarize uh I hope you um well we

1199
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:07,680
we we found this new deptide and it had

1200
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,480
never been described anywhere. Uh it's

1201
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,880
not in the uh human metabolum database.

1202
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,400
It has not been reported in any CSF

1203
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,560
before.

1204
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,280
uh is interesting because we did not

1205
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,240
know GABA could be attached to another

1206
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,000
amino acid and it's very interesting

1207
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,960
because it seems to have a biological

1208
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,280
role in tuberculosis menitis and now we

1209
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,079
have many ideas on what we could do to

1210
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,000
try to understand what it does but I

1211
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,480
think one of the more important messages

1212
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,240
I want to send out is that the

1213
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,680
technology we use while it lets us

1214
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,480
measure many compounds that we can very

1215
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,119
robustly annotate and and and and

1216
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,359
identify there is an entire universe of

1217
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,040
unknown chemistry that we're seeing in

1218
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,359
these samples that we had never profiled

1219
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,040
before that may capture a lot of very

1220
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,119
interesting biology that we're leaving

1221
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,960
behind. So while it is a space of great

1222
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,599
challenges, we believe is a space that

1223
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,119
can provide quite nice biological

1224
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,040
findings.

1225
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,440
Uh and I would like to thank again the

1226
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,839
metabolomics platform uh for being

1227
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,839
awesome and generating fantastic data

1228
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,400
and being just such lovely people to

1229
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,720
work with and the ultimate consortium.

1230
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,720
This the these cohorts are not easy to

1231
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,079
put together and require an immense

1232
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,880
amount of of work and dedication from

1233
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,280
physicians, doctors, nurses across

1234
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,920
different regions of the planet, 12 time

1235
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,599
zones apart and we still managed to get

1236
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:37,119
this all together. Uh so with that I

1237
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:40,079
would like to uh yeah give it up to

1238
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,000
Adriana for some questions. Thank you.

1239
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,160
Amazing. Thank you so much for that

1240
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,920
talk. I really appreciate that. Um I'll

1241
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,079
kick off with the first question and

1242
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,079
then I ask everybody in the audience to

1243
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,040
please submit theirs. We'll try to get

1244
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,599
us through as many before the 3:00 mark.

1245
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,559
Um I think I guess my first question I

1246
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,079
was I don't I was very excited for you

1247
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,240
when you got to the conclusion of your

1248
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,920
story and said arginine is like the

1249
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:08,319
thing that we found and I'm like great

1250
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,240
what does it do? Um so in your mind um

1251
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,920
how do we move forward once we have like

1252
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,680
these like I guess starting points um

1253
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,200
what is the progression of like the

1254
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,119
research from there I guess from like a

1255
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,079
biological perspective do you go to

1256
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,079
mouse do you go to cell lines um or are

1257
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,800
you thinking about patients and how this

1258
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,200
could be like a marker um just things

1259
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,079
like that yeah it's a great question so

1260
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,559
so we do I did uh we have been working

1261
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,960
with a group here at abroad rather the

1262
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,200
name is group so they they can uh

1263
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,160
culture. We're going the invitro way. So

1264
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,760
we we're trying to nail down where it is

1265
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,760
made. So we know we now know it's

1266
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,920
primarily in the brain. We want to

1267
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,760
confirm if it is neuronal, astroite, gal

1268
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,319
and and we've grown neurons and

1269
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,559
astroytes and we we did see it in

1270
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,240
neurons in one of the experiments but

1271
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,839
then we stopped seeing it. So so that's

1272
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,000
why I didn't show it but we are working

1273
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:04,160
on trying to figure that one thing. The

1274
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,319
other thing we want to know is how it is

1275
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,480
made. So there are a couple things we're

1276
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:11,119
trying and I the the fact that we had

1277
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,160
the enzymes described for homologous

1278
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,640
molecules gives us some idea. In fact I

1279
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,720
ordered one of the enzymes that had been

1280
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,720
described but it was like expressing

1281
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,119
bacteria and we did some enzyatic assets

1282
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,880
in vitro but it was not good. The other

1283
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,480
thing we're trying is there there is

1284
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:31,760
sequencing data for this participant. So

1285
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:34,720
we tried to look for associations

1286
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,280
between LOSI and the levels of GABA

1287
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,800
arginine and so far we could not find

1288
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,760
anything that that would associate

1289
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,000
because it would be great if we could

1290
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,520
say oh the enzyme carnosin synthes is

1291
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,359
perfectly

1292
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,200
variants in that in that are correlated

1293
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,760
with this we don't we don't have that

1294
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,440
yet um so yeah that that's sort of where

1295
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,440
we are and I think in part giving this

1296
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,960
talk is if people have ideas or would

1297
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,960
like to work with us I think is is

1298
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,720
fantastic fantastic opportunity to do

1299
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,280
some basic biology and trying to

1300
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,160
understand where it's coming from and

1301
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,880
what it may be doing. Wonderful. Thank

1302
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,599
you,

1303
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,240
Julian. Yeah, let me jump in. Um,

1304
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,960
there's a question in the Q&A uh asking

1305
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,800
if everyone uh does everyone have the

1306
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,599
presence of this GABA arginine in their

1307
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,000
brains or is it just found in folks with

1308
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,640
uh TBM? Good question. Yeah, it is

1309
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,920
present in everyone. it is in everyone

1310
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,880
and we have now other cohorts of

1311
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,359
unrelated we have another CSF project

1312
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,160
with Alzheimer's disease a large set of

1313
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:40,480
samples and we see it in everyone. So

1314
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,040
what is dramatic about some of these

1315
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,119
participants in this study who are very

1316
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,760
ill is that it disappears completely.

1317
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:51,040
So, so it goes away and as it goes away

1318
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,960
then subjects who have less of it or

1319
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,680
where it has gone away completely are

1320
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,160
the ones who far worse like the ones who

1321
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:03,000
usually don't survive. But yeah, it

1322
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,000
seems to be just always there.

1323
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,040
Great.

1324
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,559
Well, I will I will jump in with another

1325
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,720
one myself. Um actually didn't expect to

1326
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,319
have a sort of oblique personal

1327
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,160
connection to the story. My parents are

1328
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,200
both radiologists.

1329
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,800
Uh my dad two years ago or so was over

1330
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,240
the moon because for the third time ever

1331
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:28,960
in his career, he caught someone. He I

1332
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:30,960
diagnosed someone with spinal TB. Um

1333
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,559
he had studied in Mexico and he was

1334
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,119
like, "Oh, I you know, never saw it in

1335
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,839
the US." But um in any case, what I was

1336
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:42,079
curious about is um you've talked about

1337
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:44,079
the potential therapeutic um you know,

1338
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,920
next steps of what this could lead to.

1339
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,599
I'm curious about whether or not the

1340
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,400
pipeline that you talked about earlier

1341
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,839
in the presentation um specifically with

1342
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,640
regard to this case or just more

1343
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:57,839
generally if that potentially could

1344
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,559
evolve into like diagnostic tools if

1345
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,240
there's a possibility that you know the

1346
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,559
sensitivity of the stuff you're working

1347
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,359
with can catch this where other tests

1348
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,680
might not.

1349
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah, we thought I think it's there was

1350
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:17,839
some idea behind trying to get to uh

1351
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,079
well find molecules that were directly

1352
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:23,119
produced by by the the pathogen the

1353
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,119
microacterium. But the amounts I think

1354
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:28,240
the expected levels of the pathogen are

1355
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,720
so low that even having technology so

1356
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,880
that you amplify their nucleic acids to

1357
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:37,119
find them sometimes fail to see them.

1358
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,280
Right? Uh so for us the the the other

1359
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,079
question getting to your point of can we

1360
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,720
use metabolites to classify people as

1361
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,319
these people for a fact have TB. I think

1362
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,480
it's really challenging because what

1363
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:51,520
we're seeing is that many of these

1364
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,640
changes in metabolites are seen in other

1365
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,440
conditions. So you could have them be

1366
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,839
perhaps like menitis like viral menitis

1367
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,280
or nonspecific menitis but there could

1368
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,520
also be changes um in in other

1369
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,920
neuroinflammatory conditions and think

1370
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,839
of Alzheimer's or chronic inflammatory

1371
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,440
conditions like those. The one thing

1372
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,839
that we haven't done and I actually have

1373
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,359
to do is is try to figure out this

1374
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:19,839
change in gaba arginine specific to this

1375
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:22,160
microacterial tuberculosis like the

1376
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:24,880
microacterial

1377
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,119
menitis or do we see the same changes

1378
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,880
let's say in cryptocal menitis and other

1379
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,559
types of menitis and we have actually

1380
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,200
data to do that analysis we haven't done

1381
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,599
it yet so I guess the answer is like I'm

1382
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,559
skeptical we may be able to use this as

1383
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,960
a diagnostic tool but maybe we we'll be

1384
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,040
able to use it as she's trying to figure

1385
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,200
out what pathways need to be targeted to

1386
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,040
increase someone's probability of

1387
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,839
surviving or someone's probability of

1388
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,839
not experiencing long-term neurological

1389
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,839
squa.

1390
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,720
Great. Thank you. And we just have time

1391
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,680
for one more question and it just came

1392
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,160
in through the chat. So um they asked is

1393
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,880
gaba arginine finding more of a cause or

1394
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,400
an effect of TBM in your mind or

1395
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,440
according to your read. So finagarding

1396
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,960
seems to be just a biologically

1397
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,520
functional

1398
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,960
uh deptide that is present in everyone.

1399
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,480
So so what we're seeing is it goes away

1400
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,520
because of the infection and I don't

1401
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,720
know if that is happening because of

1402
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,640
increased inflammation or impaired GABA

1403
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,040
signaling. So, so, so this

1404
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:35,119
neurotransmitter biology, neuromodulator

1405
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:37,359
biology requires a pretty synchronized

1406
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,000
dance between different cell types in

1407
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:43,280
the brain. So, is usually secretion of

1408
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,599
the neurom modulator uptake by a um

1409
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,720
astroytes that then converted to their

1410
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:51,200
molecules. So if that balance is broken

1411
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,480
in some way due to inflammation or cells

1412
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,480
that are metabolically struggling then

1413
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,160
we may be seeing the changes caused by

1414
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,559
that process. Um but it's not gargin is

1415
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,720
not we I don't suspect it being made by

1416
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,119
the pathogen itself or being made as a

1417
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,640
response to attack the pathogen. It

1418
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,400
seems like it's the fact that it's in

1419
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,559
everyone makes me think that it's just

1420
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,799
normal brain function function that

1421
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,839
somehow gets compromised when you when

1422
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:20,640
you have an infection.

1423
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,000
Wonderful. Um, so with that, uh, I want

1424
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,520
to thank our speaker one more time,

1425
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,359
Julian. Thank you so much for being here

1426
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,640
and sharing your knowledge. Um, and

1427
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,040
thank you, Julian, for your

1428
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,119
collaboration in, um, this special,

1429
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,799
special Latinx speaker series. Uh, we

1430
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:37,240
wish everybody a great day. Thanks

1431
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:37,240
everybody. Thank you so much.
