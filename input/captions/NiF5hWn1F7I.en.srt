00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,960
policies to cut carbon emissions

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,759

00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,960
stoffer the growing urgency of today's

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,600
climate challenge is intensifying

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,119
discussions of policy measures that

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,400
could enable the United States to

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,519
achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,240
2050 leading Economist support policies

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,439
that Tex carbon emissions as the

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,240
approach that will bring the needed

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,040
change most quickly and at lowest cost

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,879
but there are serious questions about

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,600
the possible inequity of that approach

16
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,600
all policies lead to unintended

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,520
consequences including transferring

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,719
money from one household to another if a

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,440
carbon tax is imposed will certain

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,160
groups bear more of the burden than

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,680
others the burden imposed will depend

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,600
directly or indirectly on the level of

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,600
carbon emitting goods and services that

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
various groups consume the first step in

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,960
addressing the equity question is

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
therefore to establish the carbon

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,159
footprint of households across the

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,799
country the ideal would be to know the

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
carbon footprint of every household in

30
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,439
the United States but that's not

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,240
feasible says Christopher kidle the

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,119

sm20 now a fellow at the US Department

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,439
of energy set their sites on determining

41
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,000
the the carbon footprint down to the

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,600
level of a census tract there are more

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,360
than 74,000 census tracks in the United

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,680
States each including about 4,000

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,520
households the researcher's goal was to

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,320
calculate the average carbon footprint

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,880
of the 4,000 households in each census

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,280
track no data are available on the

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,159
consumption of electricity natural gas

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,039
gasoline or other sources of carbon

51
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,520
emissions at the sensus trct level but

52
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,880
we do have such data for a

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,079
representative sample of Americans along

54
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,920
Ong with their age income a variety of

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,399
other demographics and maybe what state

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,879
they live in says kle that's where the

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,759
machine learning comes

58
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,520
in by analyzing those data a machine

59
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,200
learning model that the team developed

60
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,200
determines the relationship between the

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,280
variables about those people and their

62
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,360
consumption of for example

63
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,599
electricity once that relationship is

64
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,080
known the model can apply it to data on

65
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,680
age income and other variables for a

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,360
given census tract and estimate average

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,120
electricity consumption then we do that

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,879
for all the things that produce carbon

69
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,680
and add it all up for that census tract

70
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,560
explains kidle now we have the average

71
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,760
carbon footprint for all households at

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,360
the census trct level ultimately canid

73
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,720
and green were able to estimate average

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,400
household carbon footprints for 72,0

75
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,720
538 of the

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,120
74,4 census tracks in the United

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,840
States with the carbon Footprints tell

78
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,599
us kidle finds the carbon footprint

79
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,640
striking there are three broad lessons

80
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,000
that we learned from the carbon

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Footprints he says emphasizing that all

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,599
three should be taken into account

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,519
during the policym process the first

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,000
Brad lesson is that carbon Footprints

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,760
increase with income in other words

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,599
wealthy people produce more carbon the

87
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,120
second is that carbon Footprints are

88
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,239
higher in the middle of the continental

89
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,840
United States and lower on the west

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,799
coast and along the mid to South

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Atlantic Coast the third is that carbon

92
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,120
Footprints are lower in cities than in

93
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,319
Rural and suburban area

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,319
to convey those findings canid and green

95
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,159
use maps with colors that represent

96
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,040
average household carbon Footprints at

97
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,879
the census trct level carbon Footprints

98
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,599
are measured in tons of carbon dioxide

99
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,480
equivalents a measure that puts

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,400
emissions of all greenhouse gases on a

101
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,400
common scale the colors they use range

102
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,480
from purple and red the highest carbon

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,360
Footprints through yellow green and

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,000
finally blue the lowest carbon footprint

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
on a map of the continental United

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,840
States the colors provide Visual

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,840
Evidence of the second broad lesson much

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
of the middle of the country appears red

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,480
indicating that carbon Footprints are

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
high in that region as they are in

111
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,840
certain areas of the Northeast due to

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,159
cold Winters and high consumption of

113
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,040
heating oil the west coast and lower

114
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,160
Atlantic Seaboard are among the areas

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,160
dominated by Green which indicates low

116
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,240
carbon Footprints colored Maps focusing

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,520
on specific cities mostly demonstrate

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,680
the third broad lesson the carbon

119
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Footprints are lower in urban areas than

120
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,600
in the suburbs Chicago and Kansas City

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,639
are good examples they are green in the

122
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,240
center and become more yellow and then

123
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,080
red moving outward Los Angeles appears

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,000
green but small sections in the city

125
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,919
center are blue indicating the very

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,800
lowest carbon footprints on the scale

127
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,280
another analysis provides a quantitative

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,840
look at both the impact of wealth and

129
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,720
carbon Footprints the first broad lesson

130
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,080
and how that impact changes depending on

131
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,560
how Urban or rural an area is the third

132
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,080
broad lesson the researchers divide the

133
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,759
total households in the United States

134
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,360
into five income groups or quintiles of

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,520
equal size an approach often used in

136
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,759
economic analysis as an example if there

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,560
are 100 households they could be ordered

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,720
based on income and then placed into

139
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,440
five income quintiles with 20 households

140
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,160
in each one they then divide each

141
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,680
quintile into urban suburban and rural

142
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,560
areas analysis of those data show that

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,520
as households become wealthier their

144
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,639
carbon Footprints increase in addition

145
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,120
for a given income group carbon

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
Footprints are generally higher for

147
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,160
households in Suburban areas than in

148
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,840
urban areas and still higher for

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,520
households in rural

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,880
areas that change serves to quantify the

151
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,840
researchers third broad lesson that

152
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,400
people in more rural areas have higher

153
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,120
carbon Footprints than those in cities

154
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,160
we find that any policy supporting

155
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,880
decarbonization is likely to be tougher

156
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,600
on the middle of the US and tougher on

157
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,479
Rural and Suburban areas says canid

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
that's not usually a recipe for success

159
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:59,919
in Washington

160
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,520
DC how Equitable are carbon tax policies

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,240
armed with estimates of average

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
household carbon Footprints across the

163
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,759
United States kidle and green were ready

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,759
to model various versions of a carbon

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,039
tax policy to estimate the annual cost

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,919
and benefit for the average household at

167
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,680
the census tract level the policy that's

168
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,080
most often discussed is a tax and

169
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,000
dividend plan that taxes carbon collects

170
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,639
the revenues and redistributes the

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,039
collected money equally across

172
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,120
households so every household receives

173
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,800
the same check in light of the

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,680
researchers broad lessons concerning

175
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,160
carbon footprints they asked is that

176
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,080
system fair for everyone the fact that

177
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,840
wealthy people consume more carbon is

178
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,400
good for the equity of the plan because

179
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,199
it means that wealthier households would

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,759
pay

181
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,840
more indeed the researchers found that

182
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,199
on average low-income households would

183
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,800
actually receive a larger dividend check

184
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,680
than what they would pay in increased

185
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,720
prices due to carbon

186
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,639
taxes thus the policy is not regressive

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,800
but rather Progressive it benefits

188
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,000
people with lower

189
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,800
incomes however the other two broad

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
lessons lead to inequitable outcom comes

191
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
from the simple tax and dividend plan

192
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
the researchers say with carbon

193
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,160
Footprints generally higher in Middle

194
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,160
America and lower on the coast the

195
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,479
former regions would pay more than the

196
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,479
latter in essence there would be a

197
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,879
transfer of money from Middle America to

198
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,680
the coasts and with carbon Footprints

199
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,639
higher in Rural and Suburban areas than

200
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,400
in cities there would be a transfer of

201
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,560
money from rural and Suburban households

202
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,800
to Urban

203
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
households both of those outcomes mean

204
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,240
that the simple carbon tax and dividend

205
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,319
plan is inequitable households in Middle

206
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,280
America America and in Rural and to some

207
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,520
extent Suburban areas would carry more

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,000
of the overall burden of the tax than

209
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,879
others but there's a way to design a tax

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,479
and dividend policy to keep those two

211
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,159
negative outcomes from occurring send

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,319
different dividend checks to different

213
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,960
households using their model the

214
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,960
researchers examine the impacts of

215
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,120
carbon tax and dividend policies with

216
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,280
the same per ton carbon fee but with

217
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,599
differing dividends based on geographic

218
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,280
location in the country or in urban

219
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,440
Suburban or rural

220
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,280
locations the the results showed that a

221
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,080
small adjustment in the dividend checks

222
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,720
as little as 8% would solve the inequity

223
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,440
problem inequity and other proposed

224
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,479
policies for canid a final takeaway from

225
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,520
the study is that alternativ to a carbon

226
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,000
tax don't look great at all for example

227
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,440
both clean energy standards and

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,759
renewable portfolio standards common

229
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,120
policies designed to reduce emissions

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,919
focus on decarbonizing the electric grid

231
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,479
the latter excludes nuclear power but

232
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,800
the middle of the United States relies

233
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,599
on a particularly dirty grid so those

234
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,039
policies will again be more costly for

235
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,839
people in the middle of the country than

236
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,760
for those on the coasts fuel economy

237
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,279
standards focus on vehicles and people

238
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,399
in the middle of the country in rural

239
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,720
areas tend to drive more miles and have

240
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,320
less fuel efficient cars so such

241
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,240
policies will place them at an economic

242
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,200
disadvantage but perhaps the biggest

243
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,800
drawback of such regulations is that

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,120
unlike a carbon tax they don't generate

245
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,040
Revenue so there's no way to undo the

246
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,800
negative impact says kidle

247
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,279
unless policy makers can find another

248
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,000
source of Revenue they have no

249
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,959
flexibility to protect certain

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,920
groups practical

251
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,880
implications what is the message for

252
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,720
policy makers a policy that taxes carbon

253
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,800
emissions is more efficient and less

254
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,000
costly overall than other frequently

255
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,600
proposed

256
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,839
policies but it's critical to design any

257
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,760
carbon tax and dividend policy carefully

258
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,560
and intelligently to avoid some of the

259
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,480
inequities that may arise and the

260
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,160
political pitfalls that can result since

261
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,880
n in terms of how to design the refund

262
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,959
checks he has a suggestion there are 10

263
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,720
census divisions in the United States

264
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,399
and he proposes sending different checks

265
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,920
to households based on those divisions

266
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,680
with bigger checks going to those in the

267
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,519
middle of the United States and to Rural

268
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,399
and Suburban areas but he stresses that

269
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,560
the decision is out to policy makers my

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,160
goal is to give policy makers data with

271
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,880
which they can make informed decisions

272
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,399
in the interest of their constituents he

273
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,279
says and his analytical techniques are

274
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,279
available to help decision makers assess

275
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,079
the implications of specific policies

276
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,600
being

277
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,279
considered as an example he describes an

278
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,000
experience in December

279
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,560
2021 at that time there was considerable

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,279
discussion about a federal budget

281
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,600
reconciliation package and for a while a

282
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,160
carbon tax seemed to be on the table

283
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,079
including a version that Exempted

284
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,440
gasoline from such attacks I began

285
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,640
receiving requests from policy makers

286
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,320
and staffers in DC to generate new maps

287
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,880
for them so they could see what

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,519
different carbon tax proposals would

289
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,760
look like he recalls did he and his team

290
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,800
do so his response of course we did we

291
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,440
were generating multiple maps on a daily

292
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,519
basis as the debate unfolded policy

293
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,720
makers could see in detail the impacts

294
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,000
of specific climate motivated policies

295
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,360
on different populations including their

296
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,639
own constituents the researchers

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,639
conclude that done well a carbon tax and

298
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,920
dividend policy could serve as a good

299
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,800
bipartisan win-win option that would

300
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,760
benefit constituents in Progressive and

301
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,120
conservative districts

302
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,079
alike this resarch was funded by the

303
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,800
Emerson Collective through the Roosevelt

304
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,560
project under the MIT Center for Energy

305
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,279
and environmental policy research the

306
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,360
goal of the Roosevelt project is to

307
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,959
provide an analytical basis for charting

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,240
a path to a low carbon economy in a way

309
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,079
that promotes highquality job growth

310
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
minimizes worker and Community

311
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,079
dislocation and harnesses the benefits
