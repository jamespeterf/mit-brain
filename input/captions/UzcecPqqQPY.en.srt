1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,719
great so up until now you've been doing

2
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,840
what I've asked you to do now it's time

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,199
to put your imagination on display

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,000
you've noticed that we've only been

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,240
working with major Tri or major scales

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,679
and Triads and all kinds of things like

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,960
this but what else could we do well we

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,680
could thinking about the other important

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120
scale the minor

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,360
scales and we'll remember that the minor

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,399
scales have not just one form but at

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,719
least three forms the natural the

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,680
harmonic and the melodic minor I want

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,680
you to think for a second which one of

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,120
these scills is most attuned to writing

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,120
out the harmonies of Rowan

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,840
numerals that's right it's the harmonic

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,239
minor form so that's what you're going

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,280
to be most thinking about

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,560
here why do we have to restrict

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,960
ourselves to Triads why can't we do

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,960
seventh chords or ninth chords or 11th

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,880
chords or something else so we have to

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,840
think about returning Roman numerals

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,159
like 5 seven or

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,479
seven half diminish 65 or four4

27
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,439
two while we're at it why do we think

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,720
that all chords have to be part of the

29
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:37,360
scale that's being played so why can't

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:41,320
we return flat 3 in C major for the

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,600
major Triad beginning E flat GB flat for

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,119
those who have taken 302 or 303 and 304

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,680
what about secondary dominance or what

34
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,320
about thinking about Neapolitan chords

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,039
or augmented sixth chords can you return

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,799
a French 43

37
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,479
chord and why are we sticking in the

38
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,399
realm of Music analysts chords like

39
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,920
Roman numerals why not think about the

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,479
chords that people use very often like

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:13,280
jazz and pop chord symbols where you

42
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:16,879
might have uh CM for C minor or c sus4

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,599
for the particular sustained ACC chord

44
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,040
that appears there if you know how to

45
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,360
use Jazz symbols why not use them and if

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,120
you've taken broke music or medieval and

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,120
renaissance music you might think about

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,840
figured Bas symbols so they're A Whole

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,840
New World unto themselves

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,159
and this should just be the beginning of

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,840
what your imagination can make so for

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,599
your final part of this assignment I

53
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,480
want you to make an open-ended extension

54
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,760
you're going to write and document very

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,879
very important document an interesting

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,239
extension to the problems above

57
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,800
according to what you've seen in the

58
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,200
video so go ahead and call your

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,959
extension whatever you want and test

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,159
your extension show me that you have

61
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,480
really seen what your extension is

62
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,239
supposed to do and what what you can do

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,680
when you're going to do all this don't

64
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,920
spend too much time on this but spend

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,879
some time

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,280
because asking your own questions is a

67
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,519
great way to understand what's going to

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,040
be asked at the end of the semester

69
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,040
research project
