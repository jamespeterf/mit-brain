1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,660
So welcome, everyone, to the
MIT Energy Initiatives Fall

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,400
Colloquium.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,830
My name is Bill Green.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,810
I'm the director of the
MIT Energy Initiative.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,600
And this is our biggest
talk of the fall,

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,980
and it's part of
our ongoing series,

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,460
Advancing the Energy Transition.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,680
Today, we're going to hear from
Joseph DeCarolis from the US

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,580
Energy Information
Administration.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,473
He's the leader of that
important administration.

12
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,890
Maybe I'll just
talk for a minute,

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,440
though, about the MIT
Energy Initiative.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,150
MIT Energy Initiative is the
longest established energy

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:57,000
hub at MIT, and we support
a lot of the energy

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,090
research on campus.

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,790
Also, quite a lot of
the policy research

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,850
on campus and economic
research related to energy.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,180
We also run the energy
minor for undergraduates

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,620
and a variety of other
educational programs related

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,600
to energy.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,050
And with the help
from our sponsors,

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,940
we fund quite a lot of
important energy research

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,220
throughout the campus.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,750
In addition, we
convene discussions

26
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,010
like this one, where
we bring in speakers

27
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:33,160
who can address different
aspects of the energy transition

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,820
and ultimately help to convene
the conversations that will help

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,360
to build consensus for solutions
so we can work together to try

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,820
to solve the climate problem.

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,710
Today's speaker, Dr.
DeCarolis, was formerly

32
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,825
a professor at North
Carolina State University,

33
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:52,450
and I guess probably
he'll return there

34
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,240
after he leaves the EIA.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,610
He's doing his
public service now

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,590
as leading the nation's
foremost agency

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,590
for collecting and distributing
high quality data related

38
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,150
to energy and one of the
best data sets in the world.

39
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,910
In his own research,
he also works

40
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,880
a lot on software
and modeling methods,

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,360
since a key part of
the energy transition

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,250
is trying to figure
out where we're going

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,280
and what the options
are for the roads ahead.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,390
And as I think he'll
probably talk about today,

45
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,540
that can be a challenging task.

46
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,980
And hence his title, stay humble
and prepare for surprises.

47
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,000
No matter what we
project in the computer,

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,930
it's probably not going
to go exactly that way.

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,139
So without further
ado, Dr. DeCarolis.

50
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,634
[APPLAUSE]

51
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,630

52
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,240
All right.

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,700
Well, Bill, thanks very
much for the introduction.

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,610
And yes, it's quite
an honor to be here.

55
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,430
And yes, I did put
the bottom line up

56
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,740
front right there in the
title, that as we think

57
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,140
about the energy
transition, we do

58
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,016
need to stay humble and
prepare for surprises.

59
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:09,400
So this talk
combines my insights

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,830
as a longtime energy
modeler in academia,

61
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,940
as well as my experience as
an administrator at the Energy

62
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,720
Information Administration.

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,260
So in this talk, I'm not
going to tell you what I think

64
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,140
or what EIA thinks is going to
happen with regard to the energy

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,110
transition.

66
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,360
Instead, I want to focus a level
higher and talk about the models

67
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,340
that we rely on to
make these projections.

68
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,520
So I'm going to start
by setting the stage

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,500
and we're going to look
at some historical data

70
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,270
to understand the current
state of the transition.

71
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,510
And then I want to talk about
the practice of modeling.

72
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,210
And there's three components
to this I want to talk about.

73
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,350
One is just the fact that these
models are not crystal balls,

74
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,200
but they do-- they
can serve a purpose.

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,500
And I want to talk about what
I think the utility of using

76
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,650
these models are.

77
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,990
Second, using EIA an example,
I want to talk about some

78
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,660
of the developments over
the last couple of decades

79
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,530
that took us by surprise and
how our projections tracked

80
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,460
those developments over time.

81
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,130
And third is I want to outline
some of the efforts we're

82
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,130
undertaking in our
long-term modeling program

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,240
to better prepare us for
uncertainty about the future.

84
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,390
And we want to
develop the ability

85
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,980
to analyze a wider range
of future scenarios.

86
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,840
There's a lot of
analyzes out there

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,940
that explore different aspects
of the energy transition.

88
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,910
Whether you're a modeler
or not, though, I

89
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,400
hope that this talk gives
you some perspective

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,050
on how to interpret
some of those studies.

91
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,950
So before I get
into all of that,

92
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,340
though, I did want to give
just a very brief introduction

93
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,670
to EIA.

94
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,380
We are the statistical
and analytic agency

95
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,580
within the Department of Energy.

96
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,470
So there's 13 principal
statistical agencies

97
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,220
across the federal government.

98
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,830
Again, we're a statistical
agency embedded in DOE.

99
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,920
Our mission is to collect,
analyze, and disseminate

100
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,060
independent and impartial energy
information for our stakeholders

101
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,390
so that they can make
better decisions.

102
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,310
You see the word independence
here a couple times.

103
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,100
That's very important to us.

104
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,250
So when we publish
data or a report,

105
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,330
we don't have to seek the
formal approval of anyone

106
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,520
else in the federal government.

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,710
And that independence
is very important to us,

108
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,340
because it means that we
can focus on doing our work

109
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,922
and providing the best
information we possibly can.

110
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,380
The other thing I
wanted to mention

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,770
is that we're also
policy neutral.

112
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,930
So we're not in the business
of developing policy, advising

113
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,310
on policy, but we
do analyze policy.

114
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,940
Policy is part of
the energy system.

115
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,890
And so we do want
to be in a position

116
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,330
to be able to analyze policy.

117
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,870
So when I talk about
the energy transition

118
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,700
or reducing carbon
emissions, as administrator,

119
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,460
I'm not advocating for
any particular position.

120
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,240
But again, I'm looking at it
from an analytic perspective

121
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,820
and what we need to do to
understand where the energy

122
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,370
system is headed.

123
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,190
We do maintain a comprehensive
energy statistics program.

124
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,160
So by virtue of being
a statistical agency,

125
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,910
we're vested with the
authority by Congress

126
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,740
to collect data from
the energy industry.

127
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,480
And so we do have a
comprehensive survey program.

128
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,330
Our energy supply survey
program represents

129
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,320
our largest operational area.

130
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,060
And we produce hundreds of
reports that rely on that data

131
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,260
that we're collecting
from the supply side.

132
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,530
On the demand
side, we have three

133
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,080
large multi-year
consumption surveys

134
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,480
that cover commercial
buildings, residential homes,

135
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,640
as well as the
manufacturing sector.

136
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm going to breeze
through these very quickly,

137
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,500
but I just want to give you a
sense of the comprehensiveness

138
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,240
of the data that we collect.

139
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,070
So this is just looking at
electricity, electricity data.

140
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,330
It starts with natural
resources on the right hand

141
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,370
side, the primary energy.

142
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,250
We look at electricity
generation and markets,

143
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,190
and then, ultimately,
the sale of electricity

144
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,050
to end use customers.

145
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,390
We collect a lot of
electricity data.

146
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,610
Much of it is on
an hourly basis.

147
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,770
So this is a really
high volume of data.

148
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,410
And we want to make that data
as accessible to the public

149
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,110
as we can.

150
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,760
So we've developed dashboards.

151
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,750
You've probably, if
you work with our data,

152
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,700
you've probably seen our
hourly electric grid monitor.

153
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,550
It's been out for a
few years, but you

154
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,000
can look at generation data
by balancing authority.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,850
And on the right hand
side, earlier this year,

156
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,640
we released the wholesale
electricity market portal.

157
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,610
So this is data
coming from the RTOs.

158
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,620
And you can look at the
same kind of information,

159
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,880
including generation, but
also price information coming

160
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,920
from the RTOs.

161
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,550
We also, again, this is just
another example of our petroleum

162
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,440
collection program.

163
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,560
It's our surveys, everywhere
you see a pink box

164
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,290
with an EIA dash number,
that's a survey that we

165
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,350
have out in the field.

166
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,890
So we're covering the
whole supply chain.

167
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,250
We're looking at movements,
prices, sales, and trade

168
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,590
of petroleum across the system.

169
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,070
We have a similar
survey collection

170
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,760
system for natural gas.

171
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,390
Again, this is just to give
you a sense of the data

172
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,020
that we collect.

173
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,500
We also have a variety
of analytic products.

174
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,010
We have a short-term energy
outlook that we produce monthly.

175
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,669
We actually just released
the latest one today.

176
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,890
And there we use an
econometric model

177
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:48,700
to forecast where we see US and
global energy markets headed

178
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,230
over the next 12 to 24 months.

179
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,950
The forecast horizon is
always through the end

180
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,190
of the following year.

181
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,050
We also produce the
annual energy outlook.

182
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,710
There we're looking at US
energy supply, consumption,

183
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,030
and trade over a 30-year period.

184
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,320
And we use a model called the
National Energy Modeling System

185
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,960
or NEMS.

186
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,010
And I'm going to talk a
fair amount about the AEO

187
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,320
and the NEMS model
in this presentation.

188
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,620
We also produce an
international energy outlook.

189
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,440
Has the same-- covers
the same kind of topics,

190
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,865
but it's international in scale.

191
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,490
And for that, we use
a different model.

192
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,060
We use something called the
World Energy Projection System.

193
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,390
We also produce a variety of
other reports and analyses.

194
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,140
So for example,
Today in Energy, we

195
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,780
publish a little piece
every day that covers

196
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,810
some topical issue in energy.

197
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,030
And then there's a
variety of reports

198
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:50,107
that we produce to respond to
Congress or key stakeholders.

199
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:51,940
I want to talk a little
bit about the energy

200
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,310
transition, which is really
already under underway here.

201
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,710
So this is looking at US
primary energy consumption

202
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,572
going all the way back to 1940.

203
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:04,030
And you've probably
seen this graph

204
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,250
or you've heard elements, heard
about elements of this graph.

205
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,310
The thing that stands
out to me is just

206
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,560
this rapid decline in coal
over the last two decades.

207
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,620
But you can also see a rapid
rise in natural gas consumption.

208
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,600
You can see that renewables, the
green line, particularly wind

209
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,160
and solar, have
been on the rise.

210
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,270
If we zoom in on the
electricity sector,

211
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,820
that's where a lot of these
changes are taking place.

212
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,620
And you see the
same basic pattern.

213
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,960
You see that decline in
coal-fired generation, the rise

214
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,880
in both natural
gas-fired generation

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,230
as well as zero
carbon generation.

216
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,280
And again, a big portion
of that rise in zero carbon

217
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,240
is from wind and solar.

218
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,390
We can also take a
very zoomed in view

219
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,740
of where we are currently.

220
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,270
So this is a Sankey diagram.

221
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,590
We actually released this
just a couple of weeks ago

222
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,660
and gives you more
details on energy flows.

223
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,730
So if you start on
the left hand side,

224
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,390
these are sources
of primary energy.

225
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,370
And as you move to
the right hand side,

226
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,840
you're seeing those sources of
energy enter the end use sector.

227
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,900
So the Sankey diagram is
looking at energy consumption

228
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,603
by source and sector.

229
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:26,020
You can see that
in the middle, we

230
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,580
have the transformation of
these primary energy sources

231
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,560
into both electricity
and waste heat.

232
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,660
So the thing that we did in this
version of the Sankey diagram

233
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,120
is for the thermal sources,
for the natural gas, coal,

234
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,010
and nuclear, you
can actually see

235
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,780
the split between useful
electricity generation and then

236
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,900
the portion that goes to
waste heat on the bottom

237
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,340
here in this black,
this black bar.

238
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,580
So if you think about it,
right, if we can grow--

239
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,660
if we grow renewables,
there we're

240
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,170
assuming a one to
one conversion.

241
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,430
So one unit of
renewable electricity

242
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,720
equals one unit
of primary energy.

243
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,620
But we have all these thermal
losses from the thermal sources.

244
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,490
So if renewables continue
to grow, all else equal,

245
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,060
we could potentially shrink
the amount of primary energy

246
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,500
we need to meet our end
use service demands.

247
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,950
Now, as you move to the right
into the end use sectors,

248
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,250
the way that we draw the
boundary on this diagram

249
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,020
is it's fuels that
are being consumed

250
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,740
by demand devices that
ultimately meet our end use

251
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,860
service demands.

252
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,340
So you have fuels
moving to devices

253
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,510
like furnaces, heat pumps,
vehicles, and being consumed.

254
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,520
Obviously, within
each of those sectors,

255
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,710
there are additional losses
associated with conversion.

256
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,610
But we draw the
boundary before that.

257
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,310
One of the things that I
like about this diagram

258
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,400
is that it strips away a
lot of the technology detail

259
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,660
that we're often accustomed
to thinking about.

260
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,290
And we're just focused on
the current flow of energy.

261
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,460
So if we're thinking about
the energy transition

262
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,350
and reducing carbon emissions,
I mean, the way I see it,

263
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,790
there's three basic options.

264
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,530
They're not mutually
exclusive, right?

265
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,310
But we can increase carbon
free electricity and fuels.

266
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,940
We can decrease
final energy demands.

267
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,790
Or we can do some form of
carbon dioxide removal.

268
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,370
And the question is, this is
historical data that we collect.

269
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,370
We have high confidence in this.

270
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,470
But how do we advance this?

271
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,840
How do-- what will this
look like in 2030 and 2050?

272
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,920
And that's where energy
modeling comes in.

273
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,540
So just to get us started
and talking about modeling.

274
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,660
A lot of people quote George Box
who said, "All models are wrong;

275
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,850
some are useful."

276
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,290
I actually this quote
from Paul Krugman.

277
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,190
This was in his New
York Times blog.

278
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,520
He was actually talking about
models of the US economy.

279
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,980
But it applies
universally to all models,

280
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,420
including energy models.

281
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,070
And what he said is models are
an enormously important tool

282
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,580
for clarifying your thought.

283
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,770
You don't have to literally
believe your model.

284
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,180
In fact, you're a fool if you do
to believe that putting together

285
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,150
a simplified but complete
account of how things work

286
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,330
helps you gain a much more
sophisticated understanding

287
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,800
of the real situation.

288
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,810
People who don't
use models end up

289
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,440
relying on slogans, all of which
are wrong some of the time.

290
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,500
So models, energy
systems, they're

291
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,780
too complicated for us to
develop, at least for me.

292
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,500
I can't develop a mental
model of the energy system

293
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,640
and project that forward.

294
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,740
We need some way to organize
all of this information

295
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,970
into a model.

296
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,470
Models allow us to build the
self-consistent framework that

297
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,950
allows us to systematically
explore the future decision

298
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,770
space.

299
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,080
So you can see the
schematic diagram here.

300
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,030
I tend to think of models
in terms of layers.

301
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,290
And this is meant to represent
just a generic energy system

302
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:04,790
model.

303
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,670
So on the left hand side,
you see model input data.

304
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,072
We've got to go out and
gather some primary data.

305
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:12,280
There's going to be some
intermediate transformations

306
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,072
of that data.

307
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,530
And then, ultimately,
there's going

308
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,600
to be a final formatted
data set that's

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,750
going to go that's going
to be fed into the model.

310
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,000
On the right hand side, you
can see model structure.

311
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,370
And it all starts with
governing dynamics.

312
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,290
What are the dynamics
that are actually

313
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,060
going to drive decision
making in the model?

314
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,950
Are you performing
an optimization?

315
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,930
Is it a consumer choice model?

316
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,500
Is it an agent based model,
some kind of simulation,

317
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,880
system dynamics?

318
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,100
You've got to pick some
governing dynamics.

319
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,250
Below that, You've got to
take those governing dynamics

320
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,130
and then encode them into a
mathematical representation.

321
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,730
And then you have to take the
mathematical representation

322
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,650
and then implement in code.

323
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,620
And then, ultimately,
you run the model

324
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,870
and it pulls the data
and the code together.

325
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,910
The model gets
instantiated, it runs,

326
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,300
and then it produces output
that we look at and analyze.

327
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,060
So there's a very
systematic approach

328
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,830
to the practice of modeling.

329
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,800
So at EIA, to do our
domestic outlook,

330
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,710
we use something called the
National Energy Modeling System.

331
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,810
And each of the boxes here
represent a separate module.

332
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,300
So on the left
hand side, you can

333
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,160
see these are sources
of primary energy.

334
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,280
So I showed you all that
survey data that we collect.

335
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,190
A lot of that survey
data is actually

336
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:34,760
being used to populate the
input data sets for the model

337
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,880
and to calibrate.

338
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,700
You can see on the right hand
side a bunch of orange boxes.

339
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,380
Those are the end use sectors.

340
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,890
So those three big consumption
surveys that I mentioned,

341
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:48,140
they're being used to develop
the input data for the end use

342
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,220
sectors.

343
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,770
Along the bottom here, we have
intermediate transformations.

344
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,760
And then along the top
we've got carbon management,

345
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,220
macro activity, and
then other drivers

346
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,960
like international
energy and trade,

347
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,170
and emissions policy,
which, of course, are

348
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,900
going to affect the outcome.

349
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,869
And then we need a way to pull
all these modules together.

350
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,010
So we have an integrating
module that basically iterates

351
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,480
through all of these modules
and finds a price quantity

352
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,770
equilibrium between all
of these various modules.

353
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,569
OK, so we've got
this great model.

354
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,869
And sophisticated.

355
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,660
What are we going to do with it?

356
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,490
And the first
question you might ask

357
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,890
is, should we use these
models to produce a forecast?

358
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,030
And by forecast, what
I mean is, should we

359
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,800
use the model to
make a prediction

360
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,720
about a specific
quantity in the future.

361
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,110
And I think the answer
for me to that question

362
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,930
is no, we should not do that.

363
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,720
And my thinking on
this was heavily

364
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,850
influenced by this report
by Hodges in [? DOER. ?]

365
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,830
It was published in 1992.

366
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,580
They were researchers at
RAND, and they were actually

367
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,062
focused on military models.

368
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,520
They were thinking
about everything

369
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,830
from models of fuze activation
to simulations of theater level

370
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,740
combat.

371
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,820
And there was a lot of
confusion about, well,

372
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,850
can we use these models
to forecast and so forth.

373
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,420
And their point was,
if you're using a model

374
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,400
to produce a forecast,
it ought to come

375
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,063
with some kind of
a warranty, right?

376
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,480
Otherwise, why am
I going to trust

377
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,320
the forecast or the prediction.

378
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,040
Well, how do you
produce a warranty?

379
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,560
You have to be able
to validate the model.

380
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,950
You have to be able
to take the model,

381
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,260
produce some kind of
a forecast, compare it

382
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,610
against real world
results, and then say, OK,

383
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,720
how accurate is it?

384
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,930
And they said, OK.

385
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,990
So if you want to forecast the
model should be validatable.

386
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,130
Well, how do if your
model is validatable?

387
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,590
They lay out four
different conditions here.

388
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,610
The first is it's got to be
possible to observe and measure

389
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,060
the situation being modeled.

390
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,120
It's pretty obvious.

391
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,530
Second, the situation
being modeled

392
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,100
must exhibit a constancy
of structure and time.

393
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,440
Third, the situation
being modeled

394
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,310
must exhibit constancy across
variations in conditions

395
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,390
not specified in the model.

396
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,570
And then fourth, you have
to collect enough data

397
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,350
to make the predictive test.

398
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,420
And when you think about long
term models of the energy

399
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,160
system, they fail on
conditions two and three.

400
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,570
The structure of energy markets,
they do change over time.

401
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,810
And we often-- models
of the energy system

402
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,020
are highly simplified.

403
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,850
So we're not they can change
across variations that we're not

404
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,000
modeling, right?

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,160
So I would argue that we can't
really validate these models.

406
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,077
And so we shouldn't be
using them to forecast.

407
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:38,160
The other thing that I've
just observed in my time

408
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,560
as an energy modeler,
is because we

409
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,460
can't validate these
long term projections,

410
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,920
there's really no
guideposts there

411
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,500
to determine if I add some
new complexity to my model,

412
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,520
does it actually add value, does
it give me more insight or not.

413
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,960
And so my observation
is a lot of these models

414
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,760
have simply gotten
more complex over time,

415
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,730
as people try and analyze many
of these issues in more detail.

416
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,730
But we don't really know
whether that complexity

417
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,380
is buying us more insight.

418
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,790
When models are used
to produce forecasts,

419
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,002
the results are
generally pretty dismal.

420
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,460
So these are just
two examples that

421
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,940
are drawn from the literature.

422
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,900
The one on the left is the
US Atomic Energy Commission.

423
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,360
This is a forecast
from 1962 looking

424
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,500
at installed nuclear capacity.

425
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,010
The vertical-- yeah, the
vertical axis's log scale,

426
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,400
they were off by an
order of magnitude.

427
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,880
The one on the right
were a set of predictions

428
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,430
about what primary
energy consumption would

429
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,340
be in the year 2000.

430
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,060
And every single
study overestimated

431
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,740
what-- nobody under
predicted what

432
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,430
energy consumption would be.

433
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,560
And I want you to
remember this example,

434
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,630
because I'm going to show you
some results from EIA that

435
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,140
exhibit the same
basic phenomenon.

436
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,100
OK?

437
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,630
Computer went to sleep.

438
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,330
So keep this in mind
because I'm going

439
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,370
to show you the results
that are going to follow

440
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,580
the same basic pattern.

441
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,570
We often anchor on what's
happening currently,

442
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,290
and we're not creative
enough about where things

443
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,140
might be headed in the future.

444
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,830

445
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,220
So shouldn't really
use models for--

446
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,030
these kind of models
for forecasting.

447
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,470
But what can we use them for?

448
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,428
What are they good for?

449
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:32,780
There's still lots of really
valuable uses for these models.

450
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,560
They can simply be an aid in
helping us think and hypothesize

451
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,610
about the future of energy.

452
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,760
They can help us
create a dialogue

453
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,990
among different stakeholders
on complex issues.

454
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,365
I mean, if we're thinking
about something like the energy

455
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,490
transition and we want
to start a dialogue,

456
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,070
there has to be some basis
for the dialogue, right?

457
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,610
So if you have a systematic
representation of the energy

458
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,710
system that you can
advance into the future,

459
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,890
we can start to have a
debate about the model

460
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,720
and what it means and so forth.

461
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,880
We can identify key system
features and effects,

462
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,490
pitfalls, and trade offs, right?

463
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,890
That's where a lot of the
insight from this modeling work

464
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,810
comes from.

465
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,820
We can also identify key sources
of uncertainty and knowledge

466
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,370
gaps.

467
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,370
It might turn out that
the model is particularly

468
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,320
sensitive to
assumptions we're making

469
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,060
about a specific
technology or sector,

470
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,880
but maybe we lack
the data to feel

471
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,720
confident about
how we're modeling

472
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,320
that piece of the system.

473
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,860
And then, finally, you
can use models to help

474
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,520
inform decision strategies.

475
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,560
I know there's a bunch
of future uncertainty.

476
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,360
I don't know what's
going to happen.

477
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,530
But I can incorporate that
uncertainty into my model

478
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,000
and help me come up
with a path forward.

479
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,890
This idea that
models should not be

480
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,160
used to produce forecasts
or precise projections,

481
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,320
they should be used for
insight, is an idea that's

482
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,610
been around a really long time.

483
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,180
So I want to give credit to the
folks at the Stanford Energy

484
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Modeling Forum who are making
this point four decades ago.

485
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,140
I also really like the quote
at the bottom by Bill Hogan.

486
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,380
It's not the individual
results of a model

487
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,590
that are so important.

488
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,890
It's the improved
user appreciation

489
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,020
of the policy problem
that is the greatest

490
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,150
contribution to modeling.

491
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:12,650
All right.

492
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:18,230
So I want to talk a little
bit about some past surprises.

493
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,370
There have been some
energy market developments

494
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:27,110
that have taken not just EIA,
but many analysts by surprise.

495
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,830
And I want to talk through
those a little bit.

496
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
Before I do that, I
do want to mention

497
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:40,080
that EIA does produce an AEO
retrospective report every two

498
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,990
years.

499
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,390
It compares the results from our
reference case against realized

500
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,920
outcomes, and it's really just
focused on statistical measures.

501
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,170
Things like percent difference,
average percent difference,

502
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,570
standard deviation.

503
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,250
And it is really useful.

504
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,470
But I do find that
it's hard to interpret,

505
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,470
and it also ignores all
the side cases that we run.

506
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,810
Every year we run a dozen cases
besides the reference case,

507
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,480
and it would be nice to
incorporate those as well.

508
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,440
And this is just a little
bit of a brief aside.

509
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,100
But this is-- there's a risk
in just relying on statistics.

510
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,960
So you might have heard
of Anscombe's Quartet.

511
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,860
This is a for data sets that
were developed by statistician

512
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,630
Francis Anscombe in 1973.

513
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,620
And all four data sets
have nearly identical

514
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,950
descriptive statistics.

515
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,950
So if you calculate the
mean and the variance

516
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,870
and the correlation, they're
basically all the same.

517
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,720
But when you plot them, you
get what you have on the right.

518
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,220
They are totally different.

519
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,510
And his point was we can't just
rely on statistical measures.

520
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,080
There's value in actually
visualizing the data.

521
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,240
So that's part of the
inspiration for this new tool

522
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,500
that we developed at EIA.

523
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,550
This has recently been
released on GitHub

524
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,787
as an open source tool.

525
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:02,870
You can see the link here.

526
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,860
You can download and play
around with this on your own.

527
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,550
I'm going to show you some
results using this tool.

528
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,820
Just a few things
before I actually

529
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,070
show you the animations.

530
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,920
One is that our data
management practices at EIA

531
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,560
have changed a lot, so
the further back in time

532
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,502
you go, those
early AEO editions,

533
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:24,460
it can be hard to mine
the data because they're

534
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,890
in different formats
and so forth.

535
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,310
In the earliest years of what
I'm going to show you here--

536
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,870
so far, we've only been able
to extract the reference case.

537
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,380
We're working to
include side cases.

538
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,660
And then just another
note that the model time

539
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,620
horizon has expanded.

540
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,580
So in the early years we only
ran the AEO through 2030.

541
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,900
Then it was 2040.

542
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,240
Now we're moving out to 2040.

543
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,520
So you'll see the end
points for the AEO

544
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,130
vary depending on the edition.

545
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,190
So with all of that set
up, surprise number one

546
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,710
was shale oil and gas.

547
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,650
There was a lot of
technology innovation

548
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,650
around horizontal drilling
and treatment into shale,

549
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,700
and that radically changed
oil and gas development.

550
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,260
EIA began examining the
impacts of shale resources

551
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,210
in earnest beginning
in about 2008.

552
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,540
But our long term modeling
was slow to catch up.

553
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,360
If you go back to
the early 2010s,

554
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,440
we didn't really have sufficient
data or modeling capabilities

555
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,460
to have the confidence to
project exponential growth

556
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,250
in the production of oil and
gas from shale resources.

557
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,150
By 2013, we were starting to get
a handle on some of the data.

558
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,830
We realized that the traditional
relationship between rig count

559
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,820
and production was changing.

560
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,800
So this drilling productivity
report was launched at EIA.

561
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,540
And you fast forward
today, and now we've

562
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,550
got a large database
of shale wells.

563
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,990
We can analyze how projection
will happen over the long term.

564
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,090
But it took us a
while to get there.

565
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,570
So here's the animation.

566
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,432
You all are the first
ones to see this.

567
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:05,140
I was playing around
with the tool myself

568
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,190
and created the animation.

569
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,890
So it starts in 2005 and then
sequentially adds the results

570
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,440
from each AEO edition
until we get to 2023.

571
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,210
That dark line that remains
is actual that is actual.

572
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,410
Here we're looking at domestic
dry natural gas production

573
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,330
in trillion cubic feet.

574
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,720
And the thing that jumps out
at you is in the early years,

575
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,220
we just were--

576
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,690
our projections were
just way too flat.

577
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,950
We did not pick up on all
of the production that

578
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,450
was about to come from shale.

579
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,150
And even if you look at--

580
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,790
I mean, in doing this,
I realized even in 2023,

581
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,660
I'm not convinced
that the highest

582
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,380
scenarios are high enough.

583
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,520
And to me, the goal would be,
if we're producing this outlook,

584
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,030
we should be able to develop
a set of cases that ultimately

585
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,330
encapsulate what turns out
to be the actual, right?

586
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,670
If we develop an
envelope like this,

587
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,500
and actual is above
or below that,

588
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,900
I don't think we're
doing a very good job.

589
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,420
So in my mind,
the goal is to try

590
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:16,540
and capture actual within the
envelope of cases that we run.

591
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,310
This is the same exact
setup, same format.

592
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,670
But now this is domestic
crude oil production

593
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,480
in million barrels per day.

594
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,180
And again, you see the
same basic phenomenon.

595
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,367
It took us several
years to really--

596
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,700
I mean, you see those early
years in the reference case,

597
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,470
they were just very, very flat.

598
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,200
And every year, we recalibrate.

599
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,580
So we move up the curve.

600
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,170
But then the projections
are too flat.

601
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,700
So that's surprise number one.

602
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,340
Surprise number two was
the rapid deployment

603
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,490
of wind and solar.

604
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,240
This is one that I often hear
about when I talk with folks

605
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,520
about renewables and EIA.

606
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,230
And I think there were two
factors that drove this.

607
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,370
One was the capital
costs of wind and solar,

608
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,740
PV really began to decline
rapidly in the 2010s.

609
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,610
And the problem at EIA
was our baseline capital

610
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,140
cost data did not keep
pace with reality.

611
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,770
We just weren't updating
the cost data often enough,

612
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,270
and our learning rates
weren't high enough.

613
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,030
So in the reference
case, we have

614
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,410
something called endogenous
technological learning.

615
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,760
So every time the
installed capacity doubles,

616
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,610
a learning rate gets applied,
and the capital cost comes down

617
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,150
a certain percentage.

618
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,910
And those learning rates
were not high enough.

619
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,840
Second thing is
we always at EIA,

620
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,580
because we're a
policy neutral, we

621
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,500
focus on existing
laws and regulations.

622
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,970
So whatever the policy is,
whenever it's set to sunset,

623
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,530
that's what we encode
into the model.

624
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,950
So if a production
tax credit was

625
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,340
set to expire six months
after we release the AEO,

626
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,790
we assume it expires
six months after we

627
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,580
release the AEO forever, for
the entire projection horizon.

628
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,820
And I'll show you
some data to indicate

629
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,630
that there are a lot of stops
in renewable tax credits

630
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,060
that cause some problems for us.

631
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,680
This is looking at estimated
capital cost data for wind,

632
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,970
not just from EIA,
which is the blue line,

633
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,680
but from some other agencies.

634
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,490
And you can see that
we were systematically

635
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:27,080
high for several years, higher
than these other sources.

636
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:34,830
This is the story about
the production tax credit.

637
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,670
So this is showing annual
wind capacity additions.

638
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,630
I know there's a lot
of detail on here.

639
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,740
But all of those labels
are like the production tax

640
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,460
credit for wind expires and
then it restarts and it expires

641
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,340
and then it restarts.

642
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,520
And wind development
is very sensitive

643
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,440
to whether that production
tax credit is in place.

644
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,660
And so again, year
after year, we're

645
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,440
making the best decision we can
about whether is the production

646
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,190
tax credit in effect or not.

647
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,420
But we've had so many starts
and stops over the years

648
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,010
that it's affected
our projections.

649
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,630
So here's what projected
wind generation looks like.

650
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,670
You can see, again, we're
making the updates every year,

651
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,100
but it just goes totally flat
after the first few years.

652
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,880
And again, it took us a while
before those curves actually

653
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,270
start to change.

654
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,310
And even now, they're
still pretty--

655
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,435
you can see they
still level out.

656
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:33,780

657
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,370
Just very similar
story with solar.

658
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,290
You can see that our
estimates, again,

659
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,310
they were systematically high
compared to several sources

660
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,780
from about 2010 to 2015.

661
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,760
And this is what
solar looks like.

662
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,260
I mean, we're barely producing
any solar generation at all.

663
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,380
Now, what's
interesting, though, is

664
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,590
solar didn't really start
to grow rapidly until later.

665
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,320
And so we were able
to get caught up,

666
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I think, with solar earlier on.

667
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,960
And you can see just
visually, if you

668
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,810
look at the range of projections
in the later editions

669
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,330
of the AEO, I think
we're doing a better

670
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,910
job of capturing the
actual Whereas wind started

671
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,210
to grow rapidly earlier
before I think we were really

672
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,890
keyed in to what was going on.

673
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,300
And then this is the final
example I want to show.

674
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,120
This is energy
related CO2 emissions.

675
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,990
CO2 emissions are just a
simple mass balance, right?

676
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,580
You have a certain amount
of fossil fuel consumption.

677
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,530
You multiply by an
emissions factor.

678
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,820
And you can figure
out total CO2.

679
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,630
Again, you can see
in the early years.

680
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,780
We were just assuming CO2
emissions were just going

681
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,630
to go on and increase forever.

682
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,130
And a lot of that
is due to the fact

683
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,840
that we assume that end use
demand was going to grow,

684
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,290
coal was going to remain
a significant fraction

685
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,030
of electricity demand.

686
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,900
I already explained how we
missed the shale revolution

687
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,040
in the early years in our
long term projections.

688
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,050
So we didn't know that
all that gas was coming.

689
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,400
And with all that gas
came lower prices,

690
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,770
which then pushed coal
out of the market.

691
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,870
We also didn't pick up on the
rapid growth in renewables

692
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,960
over the last decade.

693
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,290
And so for all those
reasons, we end up

694
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,590
with CO2 emissions that are
quite high compared to actual.

695
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,880
Now, where do we
ultimately end up?

696
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,750
Who knows.

697
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,870
And the final thing
I want to point out

698
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,240
is if you look as it
goes from 2022 to 2023,

699
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,850
you can see the effects of
the Inflation Reduction Act.

700
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,300
So that very last
light blue, you

701
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,400
can see that the curves
really did shift down

702
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,230
once the IRA was passed.

703
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,390
So what's going on here?

704
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,000
There seems to be a
pattern in all of this.

705
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,700
So these are my thoughts.

706
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,990
First thing is, as a
statistical agency,

707
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,980
our projections are based
on rigorously derived

708
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,930
historical data.

709
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,900
Again, we're a
statistical agency.

710
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,900
So we're really looking
carefully at the data.

711
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,900
But it can take some
time to identify

712
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,350
the signal through the noise.

713
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,600
But yet, we're producing
projections every year, right?

714
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,380
So again, it took time to
see what was happening.

715
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,150
The other thing is that I think
that judgments about model

716
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,860
calibration, how we design
scenarios and so forth,

717
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,400
are affected by
cognitive heuristics.

718
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,540
If you haven't heard of
cognitive heuristics before,

719
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,699
heuristics are just
mental shortcuts

720
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,670
that can facilitate problem
solving and probability

721
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,840
judgments.

722
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,320
This literature goes all the
way back to Kahneman and Tversky

723
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,830
in 1974.

724
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,429
But there's two heuristics
that I think really

725
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,790
matter for energy modeling.

726
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,730
One is the
availability heuristic,

727
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,639
that people assess the
probabilities of a future event

728
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,060
or outcome on the basis of
how easily they can remember

729
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,940
past examples, or
how easily they can

730
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,960
envision future possibilities.

731
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,639
And when you're focused
on the data that you have,

732
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,980
that's what's available
to you, and you're going

733
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,580
to make use of that heuristic.

734
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
The other is anchoring
and adjustment,

735
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,250
that people will often
start with an initial value

736
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,180
and they tend to anchor on it.

737
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,480
And even when you get
additional information

738
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,920
to move you off that anchor,
the adjustment off of the anchor

739
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,250
is often insufficient.

740
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,010
We don't make big
enough adjustments

741
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,370
once we learn new things.

742
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,900
And I think these
heuristics can be

743
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,570
hard to overcome,
particularly in an environment

744
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,340
where modelers can be judged
for errant projections.

745
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,090
If I'm going to be wrong,
and I get what happened?

746
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,180
I'd rather be able to say, look,
this is the data that I had.

747
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,070
This was the best guess I
possibly could make at the time.

748
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,650
It takes some courage
to really say, well,

749
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,400
it really could
grow exponentially.

750
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,110
Let's run a case
that looks like that.

751
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,090
And the thing I want
to emphasize is at EIA,

752
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,810
we're trying to be as
transparent as we can.

753
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,410
We have nothing to hide.

754
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,360
And the things I'm talking
about here, these heuristics,

755
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,830
this isn't limited to EIA.

756
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,930
This is like a
universal phenomena.

757
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,780
This is happening with
modeling all over the place.

758
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,390
And I'm just using EIA work
as an example to illustrate.

759
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,210
OK, so what can we
do about uncertainty?

760
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:15,440
In the process of overhauling
our long-term modeling program,

761
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,290
I spent a lot of time going
back to this National Research

762
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,880
Council report that
was released in 1992,

763
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,570
and they really emphasized
the importance of uncertainty.

764
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,610
That uncertainty is inherent
in the nature of models.

765
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,310
And we shouldn't just
ignore it or eliminate it.

766
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,470
We need to find ways--

767
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,220
EIA needs to find
ways to incorporate

768
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,490
the consideration of uncertainty
into NEMS explicitly.

769
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,280
And the whole report was based
around recommendations for EIA

770
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,707
to build and run NEMS.

771
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:46,290
So they thought it
was very important.

772
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,600
I think it's very important.

773
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,250
And to me the
question comes down

774
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,580
to how do you illuminate and
inform future energy pathways

775
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,450
given all of this uncertainty?

776
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,220
And I think it really depends
on the specific question you're

777
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,070
trying to ask.

778
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,430
There's not like one method
that you should always

779
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,802
use to assess uncertainty.

780
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,760
It really depends on the
nature of the question

781
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,320
that you're asking.

782
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,880
The other thing is
that I think it's

783
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,970
helpful to break down
uncertainty into two categories.

784
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,550
There's parametric
uncertainty, and that's

785
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,830
uncertainty in the
input parameters

786
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,820
that we put into our models.

787
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,753
So I talked about wind
and solar capital costs.

788
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:24,420
We have to make some assumption
about what those costs are going

789
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,930
to be out through 2050, right?

790
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,880
That's parametric uncertainty.

791
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,100
And we have a lot of
tools in the toolbox

792
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,410
in order to try and
address the effects

793
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,430
of parametric uncertainty.

794
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,210
We can do scenario analysis,
parametric sensitivity analysis,

795
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,830
we can do Monte
Carlo simulations.

796
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,860
There's something called
a method of Morris

797
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,460
that does a random walk in
the input parameter space.

798
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,100
Stochastic
optimization or robust

799
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,640
optimization if we're trying
to develop a decision strategy.

800
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,770
The second category is
structural uncertainty,

801
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,190
which refers to the imperfect
and incomplete nature

802
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,630
of the equations
describing the system.

803
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,250
So you've got this really
complex world out there, right?

804
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,050
And you're trying to distill
that into a computer model.

805
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:11,760
The equations that you come
up with to govern that system

806
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,540
are going to be highly
simplified, right?

807
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,576
That's structural uncertainty.

808
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:17,955
And there's also ways
we can deal with this,

809
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:19,330
although there's
been less of it,

810
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,980
I would say, in the literature.

811
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,130
But there can be alternative
formulations of the model,

812
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,422
different equations.

813
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:26,880
There's a technique
called modeling

814
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,540
to generate alternatives that
I can talk more about later on,

815
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,100
or just model
intercomparison exercises.

816
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,010
Again, Stanford Energy Modeling
Forum does a great job.

817
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,720
They get a bunch of
modelers together.

818
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,100
The models are different.

819
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,130
They focus all the
models on the same issue

820
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,930
and then see what comes out.

821
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,690
Why are there differences
in the outputs

822
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,100
across these different models?

823
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,910
So that's another way to
address structural uncertainty.

824
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,790
We know that moving forward,
the system is already

825
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,160
in a period of rapid transition.

826
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,420
And when things are
changing rapidly,

827
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,650
it heightens uncertainty.

828
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,420
And I've just got a laundry
list of things that keep me up

829
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,760
at night as a modeler.

830
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,535
What are the impacts
of climate change?

831
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,410
How is that going to
affect end user demands?

832
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,743
What are the impacts of climate
change on infrastructure

833
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:13,402
and renewable resources?

834
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,610
How are we going to build
out all this infrastructure

835
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:20,080
and develop new supply chains
for clean energy technology?

836
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,510
I showed you examples with
technology innovation.

837
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,430
At EIA, we underestimated
the role of wind and solar.

838
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,010
What's going to
happen in the future?

839
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,550
What about novel technologies?

840
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,588
What about enhanced geothermal,
fusion, space based solar power?

841
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:34,130
I mean, should those
be in the model?

842
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,838
What if there's a
technology breakthrough

843
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,990
and we're missing it?

844
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,470
Electricity demand growth.

845
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,600
There's a lot talk about
AI in data centers.

846
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,560
Does that matter-- is that
going to matter or not?

847
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,190
Or are we just going to improve
the efficiency of the chips

848
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,210
so much that it's
not a big deal.

849
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,430
I don't know.

850
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,988
Again, I've talked about
the role of policy.

851
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:57,030
If there's significant
changes in infrastructure,

852
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,583
what's the impact on people?

853
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,750
And then, of course, there
are the unknown unknowns.

854
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,625
There are the things
that I can't conceive of

855
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,780
to put on this list but are
probably going to happen

856
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,980
and we're going to
be dealing with.

857
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,370
So the bottom line
is we need to find

858
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,430
ways to deal with uncertainty.

859
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,890
Now, I want to talk a little bit
about what we're doing at EIA.

860
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,010
This example is specific to EIA.

861
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,240
So we developed something
called the reference case.

862
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,130
I've mentioned this a few times.

863
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,980
And people tend to
interpret our reference case

864
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,260
as though it is a forecast.

865
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,610
This goes back to AEO 2022.

866
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,190
This was before I joined.

867
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,910
And you can see on
the left hand side,

868
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,700
I think we define it-- the way
it's defined is exactly right,

869
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,380
that it's a baseline for
comparison between side cases

870
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,570
to explain alternative trends.

871
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,020
But on the right hand
side, 70% of the figures

872
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,420
that appeared in that AEO show
the reference case by itself.

873
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,200
So if you're just reading it
casually, you're going to think,

874
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,210
hey, this looks like
a forecast, right?

875
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,020
And I think that that's
really problematic.

876
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,420
I think as a modeler,
we never, never want

877
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,650
to put a single result or
the results from a single run

878
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,830
onto a figure.

879
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,890
Just think about it
mathematically, right?

880
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,240
Even if the reference
case was our best guess,

881
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,620
the probability of realizing a
single trajectory for anything

882
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,800
through a continuous solution
space is going to be zero.

883
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,890
In AEO 2023, we really
tried to emphasize again

884
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,360
the range of results
across the cases.

885
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,780
So this is looking at
electricity generation

886
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,380
by select technologies.

887
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,650
We're still showing
the reference case

888
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,330
as that black line,
but you can now

889
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:40,860
see that there's a gray band
around every reference case

890
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,060
result. And that shows the
range around the reference case.

891
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,820
So we're trying
to emphasize, hey,

892
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,620
there is a range
of outcomes here.

893
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,550
We don't know for sure
what's going to happen.

894
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,610
The other thing, we're
also experimenting

895
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,550
with other methods.

896
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,570
This is something that we
did publish in the AEO.

897
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,870
This is looking at
energy-related carbon dioxide

898
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,810
emissions.

899
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,750
And we actually
utilized an approach

900
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,760
that was published by
[? Kac ?] et al. in 2017,

901
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,350
and it was directed to EIA.

902
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,370
They took our--
they took the AEO

903
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,280
and they built these
uncertainty cones.

904
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,700
And we decided,
hey, let's actually

905
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,370
build this into the AEO.

906
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:16,870
All right.

907
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,100
So what do we do--
what do you do here?

908
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,800
For a given projection
horizon, let's say five years

909
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,220
into the future, you take--
you calculate the difference

910
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,300
between AEO projected CO2
emissions and actual CO2

911
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,390
emissions.

912
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,350
And then you do that
across all previous AEO

913
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,812
editions for that
projection horizon, right?

914
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:40,270
And then you repeat that for
different projection horizons.

915
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,970
For 5 years, 10 years, 15 years.

916
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,200
So for each projection
horizon there,

917
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,890
then you've got two
set of differences

918
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,660
between AEO and actual.

919
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,040
And you can use that information
to form a distribution.

920
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,110
And there's lots
of things to test.

921
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,330
And you can assume
that you can fit it

922
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,370
to a Gaussian distribution.

923
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,500
And this particular
case, we assume

924
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,150
that it was a
non-parametric distribution.

925
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,940
And so what you
do is if you have

926
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,800
a distribution for each
projection horizon,

927
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,880
you can then use
that to fit a cone.

928
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,860
And then you can apply that cone
to the current reference case.

929
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,780
And that's what we've done here.

930
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,990
So just to orient you, the
black line is a reference case.

931
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,200
The two gray lines
are the most--

932
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,610
the highest and lowest emissions
cases that we had in the AEO.

933
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,800
And then you can see the cones.

934
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,130
So the way to think
about the dark blue cone

935
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,820
is that it captures 50% of
the historical projection

936
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,880
errors in energy
related CO2 emissions.

937
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,730
And then the lighter
blue cone captures

938
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,192
95% of the historical
projection errors.

939
00:43:49,192 --> 00:43:50,650
There's a couple
of things I really

940
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,280
like about this technique.

941
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,770
One is that it's very
computationally efficient.

942
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,550
We don't have to run
them hundreds of times

943
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,560
because we have all of
this data lying around.

944
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,260
So that's a really
big advantage.

945
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,140
The other thing is that it
captures whatever bias there

946
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,470
is in our projections.

947
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,970
It's being captured
because we're

948
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,630
comparing actual to projection.

949
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,910
The thing that's the
weakness of this,

950
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,080
though, is who's to say that
those historical projection

951
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,070
errors apply to the future.

952
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,780
We don't know-- we
don't know that.

953
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,447
But I still think
that there's something

954
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:30,120
useful to be learned
from this exercise.

955
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,320
OK, final thing,
just very quickly,

956
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,020
I want to talk about our
long term modeling plans.

957
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,350
A couple of years ago,
we embarked on a plan

958
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,130
to overhaul our
long term models.

959
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,590
Before I get into that, I
wanted to explain, well,

960
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,600
what are the goals for our
long term outlooks at EIA.

961
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,930
I mean, we want to be
able to capture key market

962
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,420
dynamics that drive energy
related decision making.

963
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,870
We do want to provide that
policy neutral baseline.

964
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,680
We do want to capture
uncertainty and capture

965
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,240
the fullest range of
possible outcomes.

966
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,750
And we want to be
flexible and nimble.

967
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,180
We want to be able to
incorporate new model

968
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,100
features easily and
produce timely analysis.

969
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,340
And then, finally, we want
to make our modeling work

970
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,580
transparent and accessible.

971
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,440
The little snippet I
took here was actually

972
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,460
from the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act.

973
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,720
This is actually
directed at EIA.

974
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,440
And it's telling us
to strive to build

975
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,160
a single, consistent, and
open source modeling platform.

976
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,590
So we're on this
two-track approach.

977
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,530
Track one is we need to
continue to produce the AEO.

978
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:40,610
So we're updating the national
energy modeling system.

979
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,120
One thing we did was we
made NEMS open source.

980
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,910
So you can now go to GitHub,
you can clone the repo.

981
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,700
It's available under
the Apache 2.0 license.

982
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,790
So if you're feeling ambitious
and so forth, please have at it.

983
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,880
Make use of the model.

984
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,410
The data is also there as well.

985
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,900
It takes some effort
to get it all set up,

986
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,770
but we do-- but we are
making it available.

987
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,890
The other thing, though, is that
we've overhauled the modules.

988
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,343
So when we release
AEO 2025, it's

989
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:14,010
going to be using a
version of NEMS that

990
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,640
contains three new modules.

991
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,240
There's going to be
a hydrogen market

992
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,060
module that's going to represent
hydrogen production and pricing.

993
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,960
There's a brand new
carbon management

994
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,780
module that captures
whatever CO2

995
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,230
is produced across the sectors.

996
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,350
It can be captured
and then allocated

997
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,920
to either beneficial reuse
or geologic sequestration.

998
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,250
And then we also have a new
hydrocarbon supply module,

999
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,810
which will improve the
representation of upstream oil

1000
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,750
and gas.

1001
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,570
And among other
things, we're hoping

1002
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,870
that these updates will allow us
to better represent current laws

1003
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,500
and regulations, including many
of the provisions in the IRA.

1004
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,900
OK, track two is
Project Blue Sky,

1005
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,300
where we've embarked on a plan
to develop the next generation

1006
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,500
energy system model at EIA.

1007
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,930
And we want it to be modular
the way that NEMS is.

1008
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,770
We want it to be flexible.

1009
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,450
We want it to be transparent.

1010
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,130
It's going to be open source.

1011
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,830
And we're going to work
really hard on documentation

1012
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,720
so people can understand
what we're doing.

1013
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,163
We want it to be robust so
that we can capture uncertainty

1014
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:20,080
and that we have insights
that are conditioned

1015
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,640
on that uncertainty.

1016
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,900
And we've already released
a very barebones prototype.

1017
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,560
So you can scan the QR code,
takes you to that link there.

1018
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,800
There's a GitHub repo.

1019
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,870
So if you're a modeler
or you're a coder,

1020
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:35,270
please take it for a test drive.

1021
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,130
Let us know-- let us
know what you think.

1022
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,110
This is very, very early stage,
and we're very open to feedback.

1023
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,050
Anything from coding
practices to I don't like this

1024
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:47,090
or you ought to think about
doing it in a different way.

1025
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,860
We want this to be
a community effort.

1026
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,430
So I encourage folks
in the audience that

1027
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,870
are interested to give it a--

1028
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,250
give it a test.

1029
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,610
Again, we want to maintain
this modular structure

1030
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,970
similar to NEMS.

1031
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,110
We're hoping that will allow us
to test different approaches,

1032
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,010
different governing dynamics.

1033
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,950
We could even vary the level
of complexity by module.

1034
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,990
So if we have an
individual module,

1035
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,840
we can have a very
simple version,

1036
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,770
and then we can add a feature.

1037
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,470
And we can do that
systematically

1038
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,080
to build up the complexity
where at each step,

1039
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,290
we know when we add some
complexity, what does

1040
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,650
that bias in terms of insight.

1041
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,210
If it's modular, we can also
isolate particular modules

1042
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,100
and just run a subset
of those modules

1043
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,550
to answer a particular question.

1044
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:35,050
We don't necessarily need to
run the whole integrated system

1045
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,270
to answer every question.

1046
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,700
So I showed you the
diagram in the beginning.

1047
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,010
The idea here is that
you can essentially

1048
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,990
have different governing
dynamics, again,

1049
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,980
within each module, which gives
you the flexibility, again,

1050
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,750
to test different ideas.

1051
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,630
What if decision making
and transportation sector

1052
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,680
is driven by an
agent based model?

1053
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,630
What would that do?

1054
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,548
It's something you can test.

1055
00:48:57,548 --> 00:48:59,090
I don't want to get
into the details,

1056
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,100
but we've also worked
out some ways--

1057
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,000
different ways that we could
solve the integrated model.

1058
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,620
There's a way that you can solve
it as a single optimization

1059
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,490
problem where you take the
non optimization based modules

1060
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,270
through a set of
equivalence relations.

1061
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,540
You can convert them into
constraints and an optimization,

1062
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,240
or you can just use
iterative methods

1063
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,990
to seek convergence
the way we do in NEMS.

1064
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,707
This is what's in the prototype.

1065
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:26,540
We've got different
ways to solve the model.

1066
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,180
We've got three toy modules
to play around with.

1067
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,910
We've integrated
a couple of ways

1068
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:35,922
to analyze sensitivity
of input parameters,

1069
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:37,630
and then we have some
standalone features

1070
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,710
that we want some feedback
on as development progresses.

1071
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,200
OK, just to wrap up
here, parting thoughts.

1072
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,760
Energy system is highly complex.

1073
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,670
It's evolving rapidly,
it's uncertain.

1074
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,120
Long term forecasts.

1075
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,210
My opinion, bad idea.

1076
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,578
We shouldn't be producing
point estimates.

1077
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:56,620
I've tried to demonstrate
that there's this built

1078
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,490
in conservatism in the models.

1079
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,170
Remember cognitive heuristics.

1080
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,750
We all take these
mental shortcuts

1081
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:07,960
when we're thinking
about data and modeling.

1082
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,910
There's also that
wrong of being fear--

1083
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,420
or that fear of being wrong
or being an outlier compared

1084
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,020
with other modeling groups.

1085
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,780
And I think the
bottom line is we just

1086
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,550
need to find ways to explore a
wider range of possibilities.

1087
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,250
Kind of step through
what we're doing at EIA.

1088
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:28,720
And then this is just my plea.

1089
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,060
Despite our best
efforts, there are going

1090
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,200
to be unforeseen surprises.

1091
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,130
And if you're a student and
you're starting to model,

1092
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,020
or you're an experienced
modeler, whatever you do,

1093
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,930
don't start believing
the numbers.

1094
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,420
There's a tendency when you
sit in front of the computer

1095
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:47,290
and you're watching the shell
spit out numbers at you, maybe

1096
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,210
not in the beginning,
but you'll really

1097
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,410
start to believe those
numbers with high precision.

1098
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,150
And don't fall for it.

1099
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,395
Always, always remain skeptical.

1100
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:56,770
Which brings me
to my last point,

1101
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,370
that we have to remain humble
and intellectually honest

1102
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,095
about what we know
about the future.

1103
00:51:02,095 --> 00:51:03,470
That way we can
provide decision.

1104
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,830
Makers with an honest
assessment of what we think

1105
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,702
could happen in the future.

1106
00:51:10,702 --> 00:51:12,160
And then I won't
read these quotes,

1107
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,960
but these come from Daniel
Kahneman's book, Thinking Fast

1108
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:23,080
and Slow, about uncertainty
in judgments about decisions.

1109
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,110
And I think it applies
so well when we're

1110
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,100
thinking about energy futures.

1111
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,786
So I'll leave it up here
and happy to take questions.

1112
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:34,276
[APPLAUSE]

1113
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:38,760

1114
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,555
So thank you very much.

1115
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,430
Maybe we'll take questions
from the audience.

1116
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:46,320
And I would recommend you
read these quotes, too.

1117
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,890
Question.

1118
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:47,804
Yeah.

1119
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:48,720
Yeah.

1120
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,960
I want to start with some
heartfelt and admiring thanks

1121
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,430
for your work.

1122
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:54,520
I rely on it.

1123
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,300
It's wonderful.

1124
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,360
And thank you very much.

1125
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:56,860
Thank you.

1126
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,630
I'll pass that
along to our staff.

1127
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,130
OK.

1128
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:03,020
So I have a short question
and a slightly longer one.

1129
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,800
The short one is, do you
think about or can you model--

1130
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,456
[INAUDIBLE]

1131
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:10,180
Oh, sorry.

1132
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,490
Do you think about or can you
model the political aspects

1133
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,670
of local populations
deciding they

1134
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:21,690
don't want to see wind
farms within the horizon,

1135
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,860
and so they oppose them?

1136
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,550
Is that kind of politics a
varying part of your model?

1137
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,720
Do you include it?

1138
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,810
So I'm going to
take off the EIA hat

1139
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,328
and put on the academic
modeler hat and say that, sure.

1140
00:52:35,328 --> 00:52:37,120
I mean, I think that's
an interesting thing

1141
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,720
that one could explore, maybe
with an agent-based model.

1142
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,510
I think an EIA, that
would be a bad idea.

1143
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,750
I think there'd be
all kinds of questions

1144
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,070
about how are you doing this.

1145
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,760
It would violate
policy neutrality.

1146
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,230
But I think just as a
general modeling idea, sure.

1147
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,980
I mean, why not?

1148
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,480
OK.

1149
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,440
OK.

1150
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,800
Because my opinion is
that might be the throttle

1151
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,210
on a lot of our renewables.

1152
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,340
And so--

1153
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,292
Again, it really
depends on the question

1154
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:06,500
that you're trying to answer.

1155
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,200
If it's a technical question
about the limits of renewables,

1156
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,575
you don't really
need to do that.

1157
00:53:10,575 --> 00:53:14,180
But if you're a
sociologist or something,

1158
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,180
you're trying to understand
political coalitions

1159
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,030
and how that could
affect, then sure.

1160
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,640
OK.

1161
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,390
Well, I'll get to my
other question, which

1162
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:26,370
is, assuming you'll agree
that to reach 2050 net zero,

1163
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,940
we need to think about
great new things,

1164
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,210
great new opportunities--
and I think

1165
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,980
there is such a great
opportunity in front of us,

1166
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,080
which is remotely harvested,
zero carbon, liquid fuel, mainly

1167
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,680
ammonia, which can be
harvested in the Falklands

1168
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,470
and then shipped to
Philadelphia or something.

1169
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,102
And so my question is,
is that in your models?

1170
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:49,310
Or will it be in your models?

1171
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,290
Or what will it take to get
that considered in your models?

1172
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:52,830
Yeah.

1173
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,910
That's a good question.

1174
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:57,050
I mean, I'll just be
perfectly frank with you.

1175
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,720
Right now, we're not capable of
modeling a net zero scenario.

1176
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,700
We're getting closer to that.

1177
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,680
We don't have an ammonia pathway
in NEMS or WEPS right now,

1178
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,900
but I think we need to
add that capability.

1179
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,880
I mean, my view is we
want to have as many

1180
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,950
of those low-carbon
pathways in the model

1181
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,410
as possible, because
eventually, we

1182
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,270
are going to be asked to run
those kinds of scenarios, right?

1183
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,600
Someone's going to come to
us and say run net zero,

1184
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,470
and we need to be prepared.

1185
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,620
So ammonia is not in there right
now, but hopefully will be soon.

1186
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,460

1187
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,005
[INAUDIBLE]

1188
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:36,900

1189
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,400
Thank you very much.

1190
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,710
So I'm wondering if
you can say something

1191
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,570
about how you get the data.

1192
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:47,670
I see, for example, that there's
this [? E-864, ?] that has all

1193
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,730
the generator data.

1194
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:51,795
So say that you
realize for your model

1195
00:54:51,795 --> 00:54:53,920
that you want to make--
you need some kind of data.

1196
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,420
Do you go to the
government and say,

1197
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,680
please make a law to tell
them to give us the data, or--

1198
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,830
Yeah, good question.

1199
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,100
So the way that it works
is, as I mentioned,

1200
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,410
we're vested with the
authority to collect data,

1201
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,140
but we can't just
do that on our own.

1202
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,280
So there's a process.

1203
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,120
So let's say we collect a
lot of electricity data.

1204
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,930
The 860 or the 860M is
one of those surveys.

1205
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:19,300
Let's say we decided we want
to ask another question.

1206
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,330
There's some other
piece of data we want.

1207
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,990
The process is we go to the
White House Office of Management

1208
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:28,380
and Budget, and then
we request from them

1209
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,220
whether we can
change the survey.

1210
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,360
And there's a whole
approval process

1211
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,752
in order to make that approval.

1212
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:38,960
There's something called
the Paperwork Reduction Act,

1213
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,920
and they want to
understand, what's

1214
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,410
the public benefit of collecting
this additional information,

1215
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,170
and then what's the
burden on industry?

1216
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,620
And do those things
kind of balance out?

1217
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,900
So that's the process.

1218
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,450
If we want to set
up a new survey

1219
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,850
or we just want to
modify an existing survey

1220
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,800
to ask new questions,
there's a process

1221
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,780
we go through with OMB in
order to get that approved.

1222
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,380
And there's notices that
go in the Federal Register.

1223
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,070
So that the public
can comment and say,

1224
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,403
hey, that's a great idea, or
no, that's a terrible idea.

1225
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:08,040
Why would they want to do that?

1226
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,860
You could get this
data somewhere else.

1227
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,710
So there's an opportunity
for the public

1228
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:17,280
to weigh in on those data
collection proposals as well.

1229
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,253
OK.

1230
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,045
Maybe take one more
way in the back, there?

1231
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:26,630

1232
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,050
Thanks for the presentation.

1233
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,660
I just had a small question.

1234
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:35,450
Will the use of energy models
for long-term forecasting

1235
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:44,110
be made easier as time passes
by, because of the fact

1236
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,070
that we have more data
to verify your accuracy

1237
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,780
of the main projections and
therefore learn from it?

1238
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,410
I don't know if the question
was clear, with the micro.

1239
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,790
I'm not sure if I understand.

1240
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,000
You're saying--

1241
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,070
The point I'm making is
just that as time passes by,

1242
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:08,220
we'll have more data to verify
previous projections we have--

1243
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:08,720
OK.

1244
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,220
I see.

1245
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,100
Yes, yes.

1246
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,850
Would you consider that this
will allow us to better rely

1247
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,040
on long-term forecastings?

1248
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,770
So here's the problem
that you get stuck in.

1249
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,590
And it goes back to the
Hodges in [? DOER-- ?]

1250
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:24,860
their conditions
for devalidation.

1251
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,410
You could go back
in time, and you

1252
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,500
can do all the comparison,
all the validation you

1253
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,220
want based on historical data.

1254
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,320
But the problem is there's no
guarantee that it will work well

1255
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,620
into the future.

1256
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,280
And it's because of that
constancy and structure

1257
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,560
through time.

1258
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,060
Right?

1259
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,070
Unfortunately, the system
is not just physics-based.

1260
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:49,520
It's human behavior, it's
societal trends, it's technology

1261
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,550
innovation.

1262
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,880
So you could run your
model and realize, wow,

1263
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,860
I got everything right.

1264
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,948
My model is great.

1265
00:57:56,948 --> 00:57:59,240
And it could be wrong about
everything for the next two

1266
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,150
decades.

1267
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,540
So even though we
collect more data

1268
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,990
and we could do try and do
some validation exercises,

1269
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,290
you kind of get
stuck in this place

1270
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,900
where it doesn't
mean that you're

1271
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,350
going to do well in the future.

1272
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,420
So more data doesn't
necessarily make it better.

1273
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,270
That said, the
kind of exercise we

1274
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:20,090
went through, where we show the
projections against actual--

1275
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,750
I do think can learn a lot.

1276
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,160
I just don't view it as a
validation exercise to prove

1277
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,510
that the model is precise.

1278
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,270
All right.

1279
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,268
Well, thank you again.

1280
00:58:31,268 --> 00:58:32,560
That was a very fantastic talk.

1281
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,490
[APPLAUSE]

1282
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:33,990
Thank you.

1283
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:38,670

1284
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:42,360
And I just wanted to
put in a shameless plug.

1285
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,520
MITEI has a podcast,
and if you'd

1286
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,920
like to hear more
thoughts, maybe

1287
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,368
a little bit along
the same lines

1288
00:58:48,368 --> 00:58:50,160
as what you heard from
the speaker tonight,

1289
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,810
there's some really interesting
podcasts with MIT faculty.

1290
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:57,630
And so you can just use
the QR code to get to it.

1291
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:59,050
And thank you again.

1292
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,020
Thank you for your
attention, too.

1293
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,370
[APPLAUSE]

1294
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:09,000
