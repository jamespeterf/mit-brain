9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,599
>> Start with a little bit of recap from uh

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,359
actually two Fridays ago. Uh but just a

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,519
reminder of things to keep in mind while

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,719
you guys are testing. You know on on one

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,880
hand most of you are as are pretty much

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,040
the most expert players in your game at

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
this point in time as you know compared

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,079
to anybody else in the world. You know

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,280
the game better than anybody else and

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,079
the kinds of things that um I that that

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
means you suck as a tester but that does

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,840
you still have a a role to play as

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,680
testers. Um you can be looking for the

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,199
degenerate strategies. You can look and

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,160
you can be looking for exploits.

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,440
Sometimes it takes more imagination than

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
a sleep depth MIT student is available

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
has available to them to be able to see

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,799
these exploits. But because you know the

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,920
systems better than anyone else you're

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,880
in a good position uh to to spot that I

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,080
mean the kinds of things that you're

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
looking for are obviously you know

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
strategies where there like like a

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
dominant strategy and I mentioned that

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,960
uh uh the the last time we we were in

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,400
this room. Um but also look for those um

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,119
those strategies where like okay I have

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,280
to those those decision points where I

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,280
could do decision A or I could do the

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,840
decision B. But if I if I change my

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,759
strategy and nobody else has changes

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
their strategy, I'm just screwed, you

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,159
know, and and and that makes it really

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,920
really hesitant for someone to to to

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,240
say, "Well,

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
strategy B could be really interesting.

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,439
you know I could go for this kind of

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,520
play but on the assumption that the only

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,439
way how this is going to be beneficial

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,079
is if everybody else also changes their

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,719
strategy now you have a situation where

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,880
uh where nobody wants to try that second

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,039
option you know that's that's one way to

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,160
think about parts you know it's like if

54
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,280
you change your decision and and the

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
only way that you can change your

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,520
decision is at a cost to yourself you

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
know and the and the benefits of

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
changing that decision is going to be

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
like higher higher than it's going to be

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
lower than the risks that you're taking

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,879
on then you know you've got a situation

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,360
where it's very difficult to break out

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,640
of one dominant strategy. So I mean if

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
you got a situation where there are like

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
three dominant strategies then none of

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
them are dominant anymore. You know it's

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
like you know that that that's great.

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,000
You now have an option uh of different

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
things that you can choose. Um so that's

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
just one thing to keep in mind while you

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
guys are looking at your game. You know,

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
if you just end up if everyone just ends

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,280
up adopting the same strategy and you're

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
just hoping the chance of your, you

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,440
know, the chance of drawing the right

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
cards going to win your game, then you

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,599
start to think, then you've got a game

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,840
where the individual players decisions

79
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,640
aren't quite that influential on the

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,319
outcome. And uh um I still need to play

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
your games to be able to see what you

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,200
guys are going for, but on the most

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
part, it looks like you guys are not

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,239
going for a purely chance based game.

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
you're looking for something where

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,159
someone's decision actually matters. Um

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
so so that's so that's that's one one

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,319
reminder um from a game theory point of

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,920
view and um the other one I never really

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,120
got time to talk about games as a system

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,959
of conflict and we don't have a huge

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,440
amount of time because uh we have

93
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,319
today's readings to go through um but um

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,920
the I if you think about games as you

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,280
know a games where multiple people are

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
striving for some sort of goal and

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
they're going to be winners and they're

98
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
going to be losers and the idea of

99
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,159
thinking of games as some kind of

100
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,920
conflict makes sense. Um

101
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,159
uh and you can think of them as you know

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,920
are games competitive or games

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,920
cooperative uh folks throw out some

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,519
games that are known to be co-op

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,239
cooperative

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
>> perfect cooperative

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
>> there are certain modes in certain

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,040
different games that you know sort of

109
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
flip it from from from compet from

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,439
competent to cooperative

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,000
>> for dead

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
>> for dead is is designed for four people

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,040
to play all going for the same goal

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,639
>> of war of multiplayer. Yeah,

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,280
>> diplomacy is interesting. Yeah, because

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,479
like

117
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,479
>> it's kind of a risk of cooperation.

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> Pandemic uh pandemic is you against the

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,720
the the board actually you against the

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,440
game rules. Um and actually that that

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,759
that leads into today's uh lecture a

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,120
bit. So hang on to that idea of of

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,040
pandmic. But um but there is one

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,280
argument that all games are competitive.

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Even games like Left 4 Dead where you're

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
playing against a computer or Pandemic

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,320
where you're playing against the game

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,680
rules. Um or

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
>> Shadows or Camelot.

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
>> Shadows of Camelot. I'm not playing

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,520
>> those trader. Yeah,

132
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,360
>> you're you're mostly playing against the

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,040
game rules unless there's a trader.

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
There's not always one in the game.

135
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,000
>> But but you know that but but the the

136
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,600
the basic idea is that even in a purely

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
even a game that's generally assumed to

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
be co-op, you're still playing against

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
the world. So it's competitive against

140
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
the world and just just not you're not

141
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
comp competing against the other human

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,120
people that that are playing it. If if

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,720
you're competing against anyone is

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
probably the deciding you know who set

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
it up to to give you some challenge. So

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,840
that's one way to think of all games are

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,240
competitive. Obviously the games that

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,919
are that people generally think of as

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
competitive you know zero sum games like

150
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
you know chess for instance there one

151
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,680
winner there's one loser and there's a

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,120
draw out and nobody wins

153
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,600
uh or uh those those games people

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,600
generally think of as competitive but

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
then that's the other way to think about

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
cooperation is that all games are also

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
cooperative because if you don't agree

158
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,440
on the rules if you know if you all

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,160
decide not to play on the same rules

160
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
then then you've got uh that you don't

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
actually have game

162
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,479
anymore. So, you all have to cooperate

163
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,600
and say we have the same set we all we

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,360
have the same set of rules and we're

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,639
going to play according to to to them.

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
That's not necessarily the same thing as

167
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,080
saying that everyone knows all the

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,680
rules. Um, you know, there are plenty of

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,440
games, especially computer games where,

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,039
you know, you're going into the game not

171
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,639
knowing all the rules and you're going

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,520
to try to figure out the rules of being

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,120
what the system lets you. Um, role

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,360
playing games where you're just sort of

175
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,080
like, you know, I want to do this. I

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
want to, you know, get drunk now. And

177
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,400
how do I do that? And then the GM tells

178
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,479
you the rules, you know, role against

179
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,360
your your

180
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,960
>> constitution.

181
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
>> Constitution. Is it the constitution?

182
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,280
>> Yeah, probably. But

183
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,280
>> always good possibly.

184
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,360
Um then uh uh and then and then and then

185
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,600
you you get told the rules and then you

186
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
you go and do it. Um live action role

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
playing. I know there's a bunch of

188
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,759
people here who who play that. You

189
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,600
usually get a subset of all the rules

190
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,600
that were written for the game. like you

191
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,360
get the subset that pertains to you and

192
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,759
you assume that everybody else has the

193
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
subset that pertains pertains to them

194
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,680
and that they're playing according to

195
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
it. It's a strong order system and that

196
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,240
and even in a game especially the kinds

197
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,000
that have played in in in MIT which are

198
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,840
fiercely competitive you know it's like

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,080
you're literally there assassin games

200
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,440
you literally want to lead someone into

201
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,199
a dark alley and shoot them. uh because

202
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,880
even then you have to assume that

203
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
whatever rules that person you're

204
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,960
leading down a dark alley in order to

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
shoot them um whatever rules they got

206
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,080
they're playing by those rules. They're

207
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,599
not going to say you know it's like if

208
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,240
hey if you shoot them man say that

209
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,680
didn't work. You have to assume that

210
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,120
actually didn't work because they have

211
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,479
rules that tell them when it works and

212
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,160
when it didn't work. Um so so that's so

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,759
it's still cooperated even though it's

214
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,919
is competitive play and uh uh some

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,000
terminology now um the systemic

216
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,639
cooperation which is you know is what

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,639
I'm describing is the you are agreeing

218
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,199
that the system works and you are

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
agreeing how the system works. These are

220
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
the ways how I'm going to interact with

221
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,800
the system. when you're playing uh

222
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,759
Golden Eye or Perfect Dark um on a split

223
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,560
screen or Halo on split screen and you

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,919
agree not to look at somebody else's

225
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,400
screen. Um then you know then that's a

226
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,120
system then that's systematic rule. You

227
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,039
might also decide no it's on the screen

228
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
I can't avoid seeing it. Therefore we

229
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,919
can all look at each other's screen.

230
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,759
That also systemic rule

231
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,520
>> even though the goals are the same.

232
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,199
Let's shoot each other. Um and and then

233
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,039
there's player cooperation which is a

234
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,560
little bit more like uh the games like

235
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,400
pandemic and death or dead. So yeah,

236
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,640
explicitly trying to help each other

237
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,680
attain a shared goal. Um and that I'm

238
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,839
just trying to sort of like

239
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,159
differentiate the the the two because

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,800
it's useful sometimes to sort of try to

241
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,880
to figure out um the differences.

242
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
There's a game um that I don't think who

243
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm making you play called the war on

244
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,080
terror uh that we have in the uh in the

245
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,560
lab. And one of the things about this

246
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,880
game is that this game actually doesn't

247
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
end. Um if you look at the rules, it

248
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,600
seems like there are conditions for the

249
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,720
game to end, but they're really really

250
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,560
hard to reach. Um and and if you're

251
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,560
interested in seeing how the game ends,

252
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,760
you know, I I'll be happy to to pass you

253
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
the board and you can try and figure it

254
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,800
out or or play it. But of course, that's

255
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,920
the point that they're trying to make,

256
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,040
right? It's war and turn. It never

257
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,839
really ends. You just keep going. Uh it

258
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,760
perpet perpetuates your the audience

259
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,600
yourself. And it's designed to be a

260
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
cooperative uh to be a competitive game.

261
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,120
Everybody tries to take down all the

262
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,120
other states, the other nation states by

263
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,640
either sponsoring terrorist activity or

264
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,399
trying to put to defend themselves from

265
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,480
terrorist activity, which means

266
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,800
everybody's responsible for terrorism in

267
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,640
the end. in the game. Um, and but but in

268
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,240
the end, what they're hoping is that at

269
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
some point of time, the players are

270
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,600
going to cooperate because this game is

271
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,800
not going to end. That that was the

272
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,800
whole point of of of the game and and

273
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
the entire group coming to that

274
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
conclusion in a shared way, you know, is

275
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
kind of what the game designers were

276
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
trying to go for. Um, it's a funny game.

277
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,640
Anybody who play Crunch is the same is

278
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
done by the same folks, but it's uh a

279
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,560
little a little bit more on the we have

280
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,320
an opinion and we want you to hear it

281
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,200
than you know this is a game that you

282
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,480
actually want to try to play. Um it's

283
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,800
funny it has a butter color with the

284
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,920
word evil on it

285
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,920
and you wear it at a specific time.

286
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,519
So um so so that so that's some opinions

287
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
about uh cooperation. That's there

288
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,480
systemic cooperation where you're

289
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,120
agreeing on the rules or you're agreeing

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,560
that the system works. Um and there's

291
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
player cooperation which means players

292
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,560
are actually agreeing to work towards

293
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,880
some sort of shadow goal. And there are

294
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,480
games where it flips between cooperation

295
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,920
and player cooperation player

296
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,640
competition. It's like uh web um castle

297
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,640
crashes. Who's played Castle Crashers?

298
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
>> The game's awesome. It's a great game.

299
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,320
It's Xbox Live arcade game. You run

300
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,279
around. It's a sidescrolling game where

301
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
you're a little knight with, you know, a

302
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,200
sword.

303
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,680
>> Oh, it's a sword.

304
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
>> Well, no, it's it's an axe. Give me a

305
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
fish.

306
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,279
>> Some sort of legending device. Um,

307
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,360
>> yeah, fish.

308
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,519
>> A fish is awesome.

309
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,880
>> And and and in general, you know, if

310
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,399
you're playing with three other people

311
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
with controllers right next to you on

312
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,600
the couch, you're pretty much going for

313
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
the same goal. There are there are you

314
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,120
four and there are a whole bunch of

315
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,399
baddies on screen and you just prime and

316
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
kill it all.

317
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,040
>> But then as soon as you beat the last

318
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,279
one, the the game switches from defeat

319
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,640
all the baddies to save the princess.

320
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
And wait, wait a minute. That's one.

321
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
>> No, no, you've already saved the

322
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,320
princess. It goes from

323
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
>> to get the princess.

324
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,560
>> Yeah. Yeah, it's get it becomes get the

325
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,839
princess. There's one princess that has

326
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,839
four knights and it becomes a

327
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
competitive game. of it's like

328
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,519
everything that you're using against the

329
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,560
the baddies becomes something that you

330
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,519
use on your teammates. Um and and there

331
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,240
are games that flip-flop between that

332
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,000
diplomacy is a really fluid game with

333
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
their friends. It's like you have to

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
assume everybody's competitive in that

335
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,360
game, but the only way to attain your

336
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,720
goals is to cooperate occasionally. Um

337
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,160
and and so and so you all that's player

338
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,399
cooperation. No one's disagreeing on

339
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,760
rules. So that's there systemic

340
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
cooperation all the way through but then

341
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,839
there's clear competition and

342
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,560
cooperation back and forth. Um so you

343
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,240
know uh so that's cooperation.

344
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,800
Um finally uh

345
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,000
think think a little bit about level

346
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,839
playing field or what it means in your

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
game to have a level playing field. Cuz

348
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
you know in many of your games

349
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,760
especially car games you're going to

350
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,519
start with some sort of deal. you're

351
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
going to start with some sort of hand or

352
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,839
maybe a drawing in some sort of

353
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,720
systematic way from a shuffle deck. That

354
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,920
pretty much means that you know uh

355
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,279
you're starting out with something

356
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,279
that's effectively random, but then um

357
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,720
it could be also influenced by your

358
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,440
knowledge of the game, like skill of the

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,160
game. Um and uh and you want to see how

360
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,639
h at what point h how how do you want to

361
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,200
balance it between someone's skill

362
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,399
familiarity with the game against pure

363
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,480
chance right you know um a level playing

364
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,800
field means a lot means a different

365
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,120
thing to a lot of different people uh

366
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,360
some people's mean uh for some people it

367
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,959
may mean no matter what skill level I am

368
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
I have a chance at winning so you're

369
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,839
sort of biasing it towards chance for

370
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:24,959
some people it means Um a level playing

371
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:28,720
field is no matter what hand I I get

372
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,120
given there is a valid strategy or the

373
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
goals then get set in a way that allows

374
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
me to attain it. A lot of trick- taking

375
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,760
games especially games with with bidding

376
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,959
actually have auto automatic correcting

377
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,360
system in in there is like you only bid

378
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,000
a game that you think that you can win.

379
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,240
Um, and the whole idea is the game is to

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
push your opponent to bid on something

381
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
which they couldn't uh which they

382
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,839
couldn't actually get. So, you know,

383
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,160
that's that's a double playing field,

384
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:01,120
right? You actually have a crappy hand,

385
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,800
but that's not chance so much as

386
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,519
as the as the decisions that you're

387
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,680
making. So

388
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,000
um

389
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,440
so the

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,120
what I will advocate in this class um if

391
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,160
there's still time in the testing and

392
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,519
there's of course there's two more

393
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,079
coming back to this so so so so

394
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,800
is when you're trying to balance it out

395
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,920
towards whatever your interpretation of

396
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,040
a level playing field is going to be um

397
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,440
try to pick uh decisions that sort of

398
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,160
push you in the direction of meaningful

399
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,839
the decisions things that players can

400
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,680
make a decision and they can see the

401
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,399
consequences. They can understand how

402
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,480
those consequences play out in the game

403
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,440
um and the outcome and the outcome of

404
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,000
the overall game is going to be going to

405
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,920
be a result of that. Um that is again

406
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920
not necessarily the only definition. So

407
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
I want to be very very clear what I'm

408
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,680
asking of you here is not necessarily

409
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,399
the only definition of a well-designed

410
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,240
game. Um, you're designing a game to be

411
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,720
p played from ages 3 to 90. You know,

412
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,639
you probably want a game where making a

413
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
meaningful decision isn't going to bias

414
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
the game to the point that the really

415
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
experienced people or really smart

416
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,839
people are going to end up winning this

417
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,040
game because that's just not for the

418
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,760
three of us. Um now in this part in this

419
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,160
part particular class um try to bias it

420
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,440
so that in that competitive sense you

421
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,240
want everyone to feel like they have a

422
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,160
chance of winning but I want you to bias

423
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,839
your game towards the and whe and and

424
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,600
whether you win or lose is going to be

425
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,279
based on the outcome of these decisions.

426
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
clearly understanding the outcome of

427
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,399
position that you made in the game, not

428
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,760
necessarily just what you would what

429
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,760
what you were dealt or what you were

430
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,240
shar

431
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,600
um

432
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
you can still use those things in a

433
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,639
game, right? You know, sometimes it's,

434
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,399
you know, the whole idea of, oh my god,

435
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,440
I hope this red card, I hope this red

436
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,759
card, you know, it's like, oh, but then

437
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,959
but then you think things like

438
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,040
probability, right? You know, it's like

439
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,800
how much information are you giving to

440
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
the player about what the probability

441
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,440
that that's the right card going to be?

442
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
Are you letting them look at the deck

443
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,720
ahead of time? You know, are you giving

444
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,560
them information about how many of those

445
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,480
cards are in the deck, you know, so that

446
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,839
they can actually make guesses on all

447
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
right, we've played through half this

448
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,440
deck and we haven't seen any of those

449
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,440
cards yet, that means my the probability

450
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,279
of that card showing up is now gone up.

451
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,360
And that's now we come to the decision

452
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,320
that you get to make. Do I do I draw? Do

453
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,639
I you know do I hold that that so uh so

454
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,480
try so that's my suggestion for this

455
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,880
class I would love it to be able to see

456
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,560
a little bit to to to see those kinds of

457
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,440
uh those kind of things come out come

458
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,639
come out this class

459
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,480
um okay

460
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
so that's uh that's all the things that

461
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,360
have remaining there so now we can erase

462
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,800
that after this class

463
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,800
all right so uh now on actually Before

464
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,199
we move on, anyone have any questions

465
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,199
regarding that?

466
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,880
No.

467
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,400
Um, one point of administration. Um, who

468
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,559
here needs to print on Gambit printers,

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,919
right? Or who here has access to other

470
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,280
printers that you guys are fairly

471
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,679
confident about using for your

472
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,559
assignment?

473
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
>> You need

474
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,959
>> No, I mean, would you say that you need

475
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,679
a printer or you have access? You said

476
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,439
both.

477
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,000
>> All right. So, who needs to use camera

478
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,640
printers? Uh, who absolutely needs to

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
use candle printers? Okay, because we

480
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
don't we don't actually have like a

481
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,120
computer set up for anybody to to log in

482
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,520
and actually all our Europs just started

483
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,880
working. So, I would suggest not using

484
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,720
any of the computers in this lab because

485
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,919
lab work on it. Um, okay. So, if you've

486
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,960
all got access to printers, that's

487
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,360
awesome. Um, I know you sent an email

488
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,440
about card stock. Uh that that card

489
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,960
stock's actually out of stock.

490
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
>> That's ironic.

491
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
>> Yeah. I went to order it and I was like,

492
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,520
"Oh shit."

493
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
>> I'm going to take off with a long time,

494
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
but I'm sure there's other card stock.

495
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
>> Um

496
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,919
>> isn't there like a Staples or somewhere?

497
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
>> Tech has Staples. Stock Town has

498
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,160
Staples.

499
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
>> Copy Tech has I went to Copy Tech and

500
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
they said they can print and cut your

501
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,520
cards for you.

502
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,919
>> Nice.

503
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,039
>> Yeah. Yeah. They they they they have a

504
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:25,280
pretty awesome uh card printer. They the

505
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,880
their cutter is harsh harsh harsh. Um,

506
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,039
>> what does that what does that mean?

507
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,880
>> Well, first of all, really pointy at the

508
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,080
corners, which is kind of cool if that's

509
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,760
what you were going for, but I don't

510
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200
think

511
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,679
>> Can they Can they roundy it or do we

512
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
have to use

513
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,720
>> I don't

514
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,280
>> They can't.

515
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,280
>> They They can't. I have a rounder. Uh, I

516
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,799
have a corner punch that, you know, you

517
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
have to do it four times for each card.

518
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,720
So,

519
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,720
>> we can we'll do it. You can do it.

520
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,039
>> Yeah. just ask me and you can borrow it.

521
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,640
You may want to do it on some test cards

522
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,080
before doing it on all your questions to

523
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,760
get a sense of how it works. It works

524
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
better on card stock than it does on

525
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
paper. Uh and I wouldn't suggest

526
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,120
punching more than one card at a time.

527
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,559
The the other thing is um if you're

528
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,840
printing it on a um not like copy check

529
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,360
where they obviously know what kind of

530
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,559
paper goes best with their printers. you

531
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,360
know, if you're printing it on something

532
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,280
like a laser jet, uh, if you go to the

533
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,559
paper manufacturers's website, they

534
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
actually, a lot of them actually

535
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,480
specifically say laser jet compatible.

536
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
Um, and the problem isn't actually the

537
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,320
weight of the card. It's not like the

538
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,559
folding of the paper as it goes through

539
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,200
the printer. It's whether the toner will

540
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,039
bond to the paper, like does the paper

541
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,600
get hot enough, you know, without

542
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,880
catching fire. Um, does the paper get

543
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,000
hot enough for the toner to actually

544
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,520
bond? Um, and a lot of card stocks

545
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,039
actually don't because they're so thick

546
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,559
that the heat doesn't transfer well. And

547
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,760
as a result of that, other prints, it

548
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,120
looks great when it comes out and it

549
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,960
starts flaking. Uh, so that's that's

550
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,480
that's the problem that you can cast

551
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,360
off. Sure, some card stocks just jam

552
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,520
your printer, but majority of modern

553
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,919
laser jets actually deal pretty well

554
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,200
with that. It gets worse with it with

555
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,559
paper.

556
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,240
>> Uh, did you want us to print on card

557
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,799
stock for Wednesday or was that for when

558
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,520
it's due?

559
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,880
>> When it's due.

560
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,760
>> Okay. So when

561
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,720
>> and in fact printing card stock for when

562
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,880
it's due is not necessary. It is it is

563
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,400
much appreciated.

564
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
It was a great thing for you to do for

565
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,559
yourself if you want to make copies for

566
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,480
your friends or your team uh that you

567
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,280
actually want to end up playing. Uh to

568
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,080
be perfectly honest, if you say, you

569
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,880
know, we our printer wasn't working and

570
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,960
all we could do were these like regular

571
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,480
weight papers, but it's all been cut in

572
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,000
the right shape so that I can make so

573
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
that we can just play the game. That's

574
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,320
fine. We can still, you know, we're not

575
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,720
going to take the weight of your paper

576
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,600
into the cover.

577
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,919
>> Weigh the deck first.

578
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,840
>> G per card. It's in size.

579
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,400
>> All right. If anyone played what was it?

580
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,039
Modern uh high society books or

581
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,280
something.

582
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,640
>> Yes,

583
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,240
>> those are awesome.

584
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,039
>> They were like they were like they were

585
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,039
like kids books, you know.

586
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,200
>> All right, cool. Um if anyone does have

587
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
issues printing, uh before you jump

588
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,000
straight into the gamma print printer,

589
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,760
talk talk to Jason or I. Uh you know,

590
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,679
Jason is usually in a room right next to

591
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,159
TV lounge, my room, which is down the

592
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,080
corridor. Uh and we can and we might be

593
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,360
able to help you with with that. But in

594
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,280
general, if you got access to other

595
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,039
printers, go right for it because going

596
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,720
to run us like

597
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,280
again not for Wednesday. For Wednesday,

598
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,000
just have something testable so that uh

599
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,559
can uh folks can print but before the

600
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,679
date is due try to print something. Uh

601
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,360
you don't want to leave it till last

602
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,280
minute and you don't want to like

603
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,799
suddenly realize that your paper doesn't

604
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,960
work very well with the printer on the

605
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,960
last minute.

606
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,080
Okay.

607
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,360
Right. So uh today's reading was Bartle

608
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:00,559
and uh chapter 11 I think of the uh of

609
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,880
breathway as well and um in general

610
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,039
they have both them are asking the same

611
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,919
question which is who are you designing

612
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,280
your game for um on the assumption that

613
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,679
it's not you're not designing the game

614
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,120
for yourself and of course realistically

615
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,280
if you're going to get a job making

616
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,400
games that's the majority of the games

617
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,400
that you're going to design are not

618
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,400
games like uh games for something in the

619
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:26,640
game for some other demographic. Um and

620
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,440
um the bar paper is a little bit more

621
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,919
influential in sort of uh helping people

622
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,120
think about uh games because it kind of

623
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,039
shifted the question from what's the age

624
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,200
group, what's the demographic, you know,

625
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,240
what do people out there who are already

626
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,240
buying games going to want? Uh and he

627
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,400
kind of flipped that into what sort of

628
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,440
things are people looking for in the

629
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,760
game. um he doesn't actually take it to

630
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,080
the next step which is where well I

631
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,120
think he wrote that in the 70s or the

632
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,360
80s I did anyone remember

633
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,400
>> I think it was like 90

634
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,280
I think

635
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,799
was 1990s

636
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,000
>> right

637
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:13,840
he talks about actually

638
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,080
>> no ever that's right um but uh he but a

639
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,919
lot of the the ideas come from the 70s

640
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,880
actually because that's when he made the

641
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,400
first mod. Uh Richard B.

642
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
>> What exactly is a mud? They never

643
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,799
actually described. I just said assumed

644
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,880
everyone knew what a mud was.

645
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,919
>> Mud stands for multi-user engine. Anyone

646
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,960
want to describe that?

647
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,760
>> It's like

648
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,600
like an online text adventure thing

649
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,880
where everyone's kind of like

650
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,440
interacting with the same text base

651
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:48,559
dungeon thing. Let's describe is imagine

652
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,120
that wow was presented inactic fiction.

653
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
>> Yeah.

654
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,400
>> Okay.

655
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,159
>> So that's I found that kind of annoying

656
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,919
in the text. He just assumed everyone

657
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,840
knew what mud was but never actually

658
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
said this is what mud is.

659
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. Because because the the the

660
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,360
folks who are reading their article

661
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,200
actually I believe he formatted that for

662
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,280
a forum post for a mud community. So

663
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,360
that's assumption.

664
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,360
Um but yeah um apologies for that. Um

665
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,880
actually if you're interested he does

666
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,480
define it right at the bottom which is

667
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,679
like right at the end of the article.

668
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
here she talks about specifically this

669
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,640
is what I I mean by somewhere in the

670
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,559
footnote says there's like you know

671
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,080
these text text adventures uh text style

672
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,679
online games with multiple people

673
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,600
interacting and uh and if you look at

674
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,760
the rest of the website there's actually

675
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,400
a bunch of stuff about how work but for

676
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,360
the most part that was that was sort of

677
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,559
online multiplayer gaming uh back when

678
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,799
he started um he was he's he's credited

679
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,720
for having built the first the first one

680
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,440
and frankly

681
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,919
not all that different from MMOGs that

682
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,600
you get today. Uh, you know, the

683
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,600
difference being that they were all

684
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,400
text, but you still went out hunting

685
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,480
uh uh monsters. They call them mobiles

686
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,919
or mobs. And in fact, actually, there's

687
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,440
still some of the terminology they're

688
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,880
playing around. Um, they drop loot. You

689
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,600
know, you will pick up this loot and

690
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,279
show it off. And sometimes some games

691
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,679
that you sell off the loot, some that

692
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
most games that you exchange loot uh and

693
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
then you would use your loot to go and

694
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,520
kill other monsters and get better loot.

695
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
Uh sometimes you do it with other

696
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,799
people. Sometimes you attack other

697
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,320
people. Uh sometimes you just hang

698
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,840
around and chat and talk about things

699
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,640
that are completely not in game like

700
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,760
what if I have a bunch of

701
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,400
some awesome Um

702
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,240
and uh sometimes sometimes it will take

703
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,159
multiple people to take down a to take a

704
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
monster you know and it was just handled

705
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,880
that you know how fast can you type kind

706
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,880
of thing. Um you know attack monster

707
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,279
attack monster attack and I think you

708
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:56,720
can just hit repeat

709
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:59,120
um and uh but uh

710
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,440
the behaviors are also not all that

711
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,400
different. And um how he describes it is

712
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,600
a whole a a game kind will will kind of

713
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,360
sight sight itself in a position where

714
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,840
it is like ve variably

715
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,000
appealing to various kinds of players.

716
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,159
Uh and that's how he describes it. Where

717
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,720
game studies has kind of gone to on

718
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,960
since then is the realization that just

719
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:31,440
because you're uh actually some people

720
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,440
throw out the four types that he that he

721
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,440
>> explorers

722
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,240
and killers. Yeah. So you know it's like

723
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,279
there are these four types of players

724
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,640
and just like just because you're

725
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,440
achiever in one game doesn't necessarily

726
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,880
mean that you're going to be achie

727
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,360
nothing. different people play different

728
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
games or possibly even different times

729
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
of the day in the same game for

730
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,600
different reasons. Uh and uh and that's

731
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,640
where we go back to earlier concepts

732
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,000
that we brought up in this class like

733
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,120
the different kind kinds of fun. What

734
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,840
are people trying to get out of their

735
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,200
game, right? Um so but he was you know

736
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,679
um if you're looking at the context of

737
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,360
any one mud you know and a little slice

738
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,200
of what you saw of somebody's

739
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,799
personality when they were logged in and

740
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,799
all the things that they were doing and

741
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,240
it and the kinds of things that they

742
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,640
tended to keep doing every time you

743
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,039
logged in. It was fairly easy to sort of

744
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,279
stereotype them into somewhere along

745
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,080
those lines. Even he acknowledges that

746
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,200
nobody's really all the way on on one of

747
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,159
these lines. grief griefers I I think

748
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,640
are the words that I hear generally use

749
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,480
for killers nowadays, but even then

750
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,320
that's not quite the way that he's using

751
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,240
it. He's actually using it as somebody

752
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,480
who's generally still playing by the

753
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,400
rules of game, you know, u you know,

754
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,159
they're not they're out there to cause

755
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,640
misery to other people, but they're not

756
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,480
there to break the game. Um there's

757
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,679
there is a class of people of reavers

758
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,000
where they're deliberately trying to

759
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,799
find ways to exploit the system to just

760
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,600
make to make the game just kind of

761
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,600
silly. Um but all the other dynamically

762
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,200
it draws are very much there. It's like

763
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,559
you get a whole bunch of socializers

764
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,520
together, people who want to do nothing

765
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,799
but chat and have a good time. Uh don't

766
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,320
really care about game and it's going to

767
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,320
be a whole bunch of people going right

768
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,720
after them and saying these are great

769
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,919
people to grief. uh you know because

770
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,120
they are enjoying themselves so much. We

771
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,440
could end that.

772
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,200
Um Second Life, you guessed a lot of

773
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,200
this because Second Life has that whole

774
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,440
like uh um you know, you can do anything

775
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,760
you want and socializing is one of the

776
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,880
big things. Uh personalizing is one of

777
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:38,000
those big things. But um so so so do

778
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,159
keep in mind that you know um that the

779
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,360
way that he's talking about it sounds

780
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,399
like all of these different

781
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,080
personalities are somewhat mutually

782
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,080
exclusive when really the discussion has

783
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,279
come has now come on to how do you sort

784
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,960
of cater to all of these uh different to

785
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,200
all of these different desires at any

786
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,360
given time. I may be achiever today, I

787
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,159
may be an explorer tomorrow. And he even

788
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,919
talks about explorers thinking that

789
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,279
achievers are beginner explorers, you

790
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,960
know, because it's like once you've

791
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,399
already beaten the game, what else is

792
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,919
there left to do but explore what else

793
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,919
the game can do, you know? So, so, so

794
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,799
that's so he he himself acknowledges

795
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,720
that there's some personality transfer

796
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,480
that can happen.

797
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,080
Uh, but it's kind of interesting how he

798
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,600
talks about the feedback loops about of

799
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,279
people, right? You know, it's like you

800
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,159
get a whole bunch of um what was it? You

801
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:35,200
get a whole bunch of achievers and you

802
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,200
get a whole bunch of um

803
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
>> socializing

804
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,960
increases.

805
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,440
>> Yeah, increases because the competition

806
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,520
is now higher or something like that.

807
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,279
But he also makes this weird assumption

808
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,039
that there is a finite pool of people

809
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,440
who can be playing the game which is

810
00:29:53,039 --> 00:30:00,559
actually true. Even in a, you know,

811
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,880
a 10 to 20 million player game like

812
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,279
World of Warcraft, you know, all those

813
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,640
things have to be um like we don't have

814
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,679
20 million people logging on to one

815
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,039
server, you know,

816
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,000
they say I want eight eight heights of

817
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,200
sheep or something,

818
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
>> right?

819
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
>> Eight sheep.

820
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,279
>> Exactly. Exactly. And then like once you

821
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,760
hit level 80, you can start uh doing

822
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,480
these raids that are just really big

823
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,320
down

824
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,000
>> for lots of people. Uh like 25. It's

825
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,039
currently 25 is the highest. They used

826
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,039
to be like 40. Um but yeah, and you just

827
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,440
kill bigger monsters and get lots of

828
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:44,399
boot. Um, and then there's PvP, which

829
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,360
you go, the main thing right now is like

830
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,039
arenas, and you have a team of two or

831
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,279
three or five, and you fight other

832
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,000
players with your gear that you obtain

833
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:58,159
by doing battlegrounds and and lots of

834
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,919
arena. Uh, yeah, and it's that's

835
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,640
basically WoW.

836
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,760
>> They use um I can't remember. Are there

837
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,600
roleplay servers?

838
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,000
>> Yes, there are world roleplay servers. I

839
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,960
have actually never visited one

840
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,679
>> so I can't talk about that.

841
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,679
>> So it's a lot of dancing.

842
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,840
>> Dance is a you know typing in slash

843
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,279
dance made your your your character

844
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,720
dance and it was one of those things

845
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:29,039
that really is popular among socialized

846
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,559
type uh players all all over any

847
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,880
episode. Um but it's not just a I mean

848
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,799
slash dance means other things now. It

849
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
it could it could be I'm bored, right?

850
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,760
You know, it's like I have nothing to do

851
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,279
right now. I have to wait for this

852
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,640
stupid thing to respond. I guess

853
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,799
it's it's more fun than just standing

854
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,840
there. Um

855
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:55,120
but the uh uh there is a group in in WoW

856
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,799
and I I guess I would may maybe not a

857
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,519
group there is there there are folks who

858
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,519
play World of Warcraft um and they

859
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,320
engage in this thing called theory craft

860
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:10,080
which is how do we optimize uh the way

861
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,760
how you build a character um and uh to

862
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,600
the and the things that you equip a play

863
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,519
a character for to be make that

864
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,320
character really really good at doing

865
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,279
one or two different things. Um, so if

866
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,880
you're building up, you know, a

867
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,559
character that's designed to heal, you

868
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,000
know, what class should they be, what

869
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,919
race should they be, what equipment

870
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,519
should they be getting, you know,

871
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,279
depending on what amount of time you are

872
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,320
in in the game. Um, and uh, you know,

873
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,200
they're they're going to try to like

874
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,840
derive as much of math of of the kind

875
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,640
of, you know, cause and effect in

876
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,399
anything as we possibly can. Um, there's

877
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,880
a client called the STS uh, which uh,

878
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:50,039
which which is I can't remember if they

879
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,039
actually exclam

880
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:00,799
>> um it's actually kind of funny uh the

881
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,919
elitist jerks forums had one guy who

882
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,039
just happened to write a artic a forum

883
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,720
post about dressing up in real life like

884
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,159
you know like this is how you get like

885
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,519
really nice Taylor clothes and these are

886
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,240
things you'll be looking for because he

887
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,279
worked at a men so

888
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,120
uh fashion uh space. Um and it turned

889
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,039
out that that community was really

890
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,120
really really interested in learning

891
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,320
more about that. Uh you know, which is

892
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,840
actually not that weird, right? It's

893
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,000
like you care about what armor you get

894
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,120
in the game. If you care about what

895
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,480
clothes you wear in real life,

896
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,720
especially if it might have some impact

897
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,880
on your real life, the job that you're

898
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,960
looking for. Okay? You know, so um so I

899
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,039
would actually put those more in the

900
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,640
explorers part of thing, you know. Sure,

901
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,399
they're looking for to optimize. They're

902
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,159
looking to do the best, but they're not

903
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,600
looking to be necessarily rewarded by

904
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,679
the game system. They're using the game

905
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,360
system to test their ideas against, you

906
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,279
know, it's like, I'm looking for a

907
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,600
better way to to suck up more damage,

908
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,320
you know, because I'm a tank. I I'm I'm

909
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,320
supposedly absorbing all the damage all

910
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,519
all the other call it uh uh all the

911
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,720
attentions of the of the of the

912
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,639
characters being controlled by the

913
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,240
computer. while the rest of my folks who

914
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:17,280
put out a lot of damage, you know, can

915
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:22,240
do their job. Um, but I'm not interested

916
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,639
in what the system has deemed to be you

917
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,720
have absolved tons of damage. Good job.

918
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,040
I don't care what the system says. I

919
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,720
care how the system operates so that I

920
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,159
can optimize it through some sort of

921
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,440
metric that I figured out and my friends

922
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,200
have figured out and the community has

923
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,480
figured out. So, I want to understand

924
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,159
the system in the end. that's what it

925
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,839
comes down to the the metric that

926
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,480
they're using it is how do I optimize

927
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,079
but for the most part uh people who

928
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,079
engage in that kind of theory craft you

929
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,639
know it's like oh no this this armor

930
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,040
combined with those pants uh you know I

931
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,960
now find proof or something uh you know

932
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,879
those are those are well in the area of

933
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,119
explor

934
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,440
behavior seems very much let's find the

935
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,839
best solution whereas achievers are very

936
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,960
much folks like you know how do I get to

937
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,640
level you know it's like um how do I get

938
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,440
the coolest

939
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,359
in World of Warcraft right hands. Um,

940
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,000
you know, and every once in a while

941
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,400
Blizzard, the company that makes it will

942
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
release some of your stuff and the

943
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,920
achievers are like, I got to get that.

944
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,920
You know, it's like uh because the

945
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
stakes are usually high and it takes a

946
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,119
lot of effort and a lot of money to be

947
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,960
able to get one of those things, but and

948
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,359
to be able to get it gives you some

949
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,880
recognizable status. You'll see someone

950
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,720
with the limited edition some kind of uh

951
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,000
amount and you only and you know that

952
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,520
the only that they could have done that

953
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,760
is to spend a heck of a lot of time in

954
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,960
this game and play the game really well.

955
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,240
You know, that's that's the kind of

956
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,119
recognition they're looking for. So,

957
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,040
that's kind of the difference between

958
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,240
achievements and sports.

959
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,599
Um so I actually want to try one little

960
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,520
activity which is I got that I got the

961
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,240
chart that um uh

962
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,440
uh lays out the whole player versus you

963
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:08,079
know player interacting and acting

964
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,800
player and and the world um and he uses

965
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,960
this to describe where your game could

966
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,280
be at any given time. you know, if

967
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,119
you're acting on players, then you know,

968
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,720
you're the kind of person uh then then

969
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,000
your game is kind of biased towards

970
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,680
killers. Uh if you are in if you're more

971
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,119
if you're designing your game to be more

972
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,640
about interacting with other players,

973
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,800
then you're sort of biasing it towards

974
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,119
the socializers. Interacting with the

975
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
world is more the achievers, you know.

976
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,119
Oh, sorry. No, acting on on the world is

977
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,359
more the achievers, you know. And given

978
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,000
these quests, I've beaten all the quests

979
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,000
and like 100 per

980
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,400
the the quest told me that's

981
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,320
achievements. And uh interacting with

982
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,800
the world is more of the explorance.

983
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,839
It's like you know um what else can I do

984
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,119
with this world? You know, there are

985
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,040
these goals that are set. That's great,

986
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,560
but other than this world that I can do

987
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,720
good stuff. I found the distinction

988
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,320
between acting and interacting

989
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,119
incredibly

990
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,960
hard to get at. Like I didn't really

991
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,079
understand what he was trying to say. It

992
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,920
was it was easier. I think he he came

993
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,320
across those two terms because they

994
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,079
sounded cute. Uh you know acting

995
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,760
interacting is like

996
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,040
>> I mean how do you interact without

997
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,880
acting?

998
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,760
>> Well what does what does that mean?

999
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,480
>> Yeah it's um

1000
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,240
>> and like the the really classic example

1001
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,599
they use like that acting on a player is

1002
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,160
like a killer

1003
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,160
>> trying to attack another player but like

1004
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,760
the other player fights back. There's an

1005
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,960
interaction there. Right.

1006
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
>> Sure. But the thing about it,

1007
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,240
>> what's he trying to say?

1008
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,000
>> Ah, so what so I believe what he means

1009
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,680
by that is that the killer is actually

1010
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,520
less interested in what the the player

1011
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,280
does back to them. I mean, in some

1012
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,400
sense, they are interacting because

1013
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,079
they're trying to see what sort of

1014
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,839
response they get, right? And it's like,

1015
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,440
I'm going to do something to this

1016
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:56,560
player. This player is either going to

1017
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:59,359
die or fight back or whine uh about the

1018
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,839
fact that I'm hating them so much. Um,

1019
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,599
but they're not looking for the

1020
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,599
competitive fit. They're they're not

1021
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,040
really interested in you and now that

1022
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,599
person going to turn around and attack

1023
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
me.

1024
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,119
>> I know. But the whole point is supposed

1025
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,119
to be that the killers are griefers. So

1026
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,440
they really care about how people

1027
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,440
respond to them. Like he he says later

1028
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,599
on that like one of the most annoying

1029
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,520
things you can do to a griefer is just

1030
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,599
ignore them, not rise to the debate,

1031
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,760
right? So interacting

1032
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,280
>> seems to be the crucial thing. So again,

1033
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,079
I feel like he's

1034
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,000
>> well, okay. So yeah, I I admit that the

1035
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:39,280
terms are, but uh well, I guess if I can

1036
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,680
jump how I kind of perceive it as like

1037
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,480
does the person care about how the other

1038
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,079
thing works in a sense, you know what I

1039
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,440
mean? So it's like it is it is the case

1040
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,240
that a griefer wants to get a certain

1041
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,560
reaction, but like beyond that, it

1042
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,880
doesn't matter, right? So in the same

1043
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,880
case with the game system, right? like I

1044
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,640
want it to do this thing. I want it to

1045
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,079
give me points, but why it did that or

1046
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,160
how the mechanic works is kind of

1047
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,320
irrelevant. I don't know. I mean, that's

1048
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,480
kind of how I understood it.

1049
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,359
>> Well, well, in particular, like with the

1050
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,440
the interacting

1051
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,240
when when somebody is like trying to

1052
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,800
player kill or something, it the the

1053
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,720
reaction is not necessarily the reaction

1054
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,200
they're looking for is to like piss

1055
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,960
somebody off, right? Um, and that

1056
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,960
reaction is not necessarily part of the

1057
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,720
game.

1058
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,000
So like the the the the it it is acting

1059
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,000
on them because you are taking like what

1060
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,440
the game allows you to do and using this

1061
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,359
against a person but you don't care

1062
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,119
about what they use in the game against

1063
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,800
you. You you more care about this like

1064
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,640
abstract idea.

1065
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,880
>> So I think the the interaction is not

1066
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,720
actually part of the game. So acting is

1067
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,720
specifically to do with game mechanics

1068
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,359
whereas interacting is to do with

1069
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,599
something which is so maybe acting is

1070
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,599
like something mechanical whereas

1071
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,359
interacting is something dynamics

1072
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,920
related or like well I I see it as like

1073
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,680
acting is

1074
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,240
um sort of like a a single direction

1075
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,240
with mechanics. So, for example, the

1076
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,599
mechanic there is is being able to like

1077
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,040
hit somebody in the head with your

1078
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,480
sword, right?

1079
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,119
>> Um whereas interacting would be the case

1080
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,680
where you're hitting each other on each

1081
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,760
other's heads with your sword, which is

1082
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,680
an entirely different thing and is more

1083
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,560
of like a competitive thing rather than

1084
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,640
the I just want to make you angry.

1085
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,480
>> Well, and I think the unidirectional

1086
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,680
perspective makes sense. Um you could

1087
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,680
think of it as going with the hitting on

1088
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,680
the head example, right? If I'm acting,

1089
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,160
then I care that information is flowing

1090
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,880
one way. I am dealing damage to you. If

1091
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,640
I'm interacting, I'm curious as to like

1092
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,880
how that is computed and what that means

1093
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,400
for me in return.

1094
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,119
>> Does that make sense? So like if I'm

1095
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,280
>> really bad terminology

1096
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,240
a bunch of other examples of things that

1097
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,760
you do to like maximize interacting

1098
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,599
versus acting and like the interacting

1099
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,440
examples are things like make make

1100
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,560
simple puzzles and then the acting ones

1101
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,280
are like make hard puzzles and like

1102
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,440
>> wait what what

1103
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,720
so so in the context of a mud a puzzle

1104
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,079
is often like a door right you know it's

1105
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,079
like you've got to solve this puzzle be

1106
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,640
able to get into a new area because

1107
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,240
that's really the only thing that like

1108
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:32,800
sometimes you get new loot. Um, and the

1109
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:35,520
idea behind that is if you're sort of if

1110
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,000
you're sort of either privileging it to

1111
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,599
getting people to uh talk with each

1112
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,520
other more and socialize with each other

1113
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,680
more or you're privileging it to getting

1114
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,400
people to look at the world more, see

1115
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,200
more of the world and and and and

1116
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,359
understand how how it works. Then in a

1117
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,839
sense you don't want to put too many

1118
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,040
barriers between you know the people

1119
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,400
who've been playing for a long time and

1120
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,240
people who just started playing the

1121
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,680
people who uh uh uh you know who are in

1122
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,880
one area of the world and people who are

1123
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,680
in another area of the world you kind of

1124
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,359
want quick flow. So in muds that's that

1125
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,359
that's one thing where the the

1126
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,760
definition of puzzle is very specific.

1127
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,359
It's like but I have to move this set of

1128
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,440
levers. This is another another point

1129
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,720
that I found was really strange because

1130
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,480
I would expect an explorer who is a

1131
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,079
supposed to be a world interacting

1132
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,560
person

1133
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,560
>> to really enjoy deep puzzles which

1134
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,280
reward them for knowing a lot about the

1135
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,720
world.

1136
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,480
>> Ah but the problem with puzzles in Merks

1137
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,400
is that they're usual they're usually

1138
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,960
single solution.

1139
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,960
>> That's the so there's less pleasure to

1140
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,640
be uh to be found in a very difficult

1141
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,839
puzzle because all that told you was you

1142
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,200
just solved this one thing. There is

1143
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,839
still puzzle that there is still some

1144
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,720
pleasure there. The interest that most

1145
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,040
that that explorers are way more

1146
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,280
compelled by kind of like that uh like

1147
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,000
the dynamics right is like understanding

1148
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,319
the interaction of how of mechanics

1149
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,920
especially if they behave in a way that

1150
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,599
might not have been originally designed

1151
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,720
that way you know it's like that's what

1152
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,319
they're looking for. They're not looking

1153
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,920
for what is the solution that was

1154
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,079
designed in the game. They're looking

1155
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,040
for how do I get this game to do

1156
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,960
something that it might not have been

1157
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,280
designed to do originally but will be

1158
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:18,079
cool once they figure it out. Um so so

1159
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,760
that I mean that that unfortunately

1160
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,000
you're absolutely right that one but

1161
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,720
that one suffers from the very specific

1162
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,200
terminology of what a puzzle is and as

1163
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,400
opposed to the sort of more general

1164
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,760
definition of what a puzzle is. Um, the

1165
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,079
reason why why at least for achievers,

1166
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,839
hard puzzles are very important because

1167
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,200
there's because if you make a puzzle

1168
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,760
that most people aren't going to be able

1169
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,480
to get, being able to get that puzzle

1170
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,400
gives you some bad status. Usually some

1171
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,839
sort of visible reward even. It's like

1172
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,760
you're now in a location that nobody

1173
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,240
else can get to or you're now you now

1174
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,280
have have a piece of equipment that that

1175
00:43:52,240 --> 00:44:00,240
that no one else has. Whereas explorers,

1176
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:03,200
you know, they will probably have a

1177
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,960
advantage in solving difficult puzzles,

1178
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,040
but they're not necessarily the sort of

1179
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,839
thing that makes them want to interact

1180
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,359
well. You know, they lots of mechanics

1181
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,200
that sort of interact with each other in

1182
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,560
really really interesting ways, more

1183
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,560
likely to be interested to explore.

1184
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,200
Um, but you're right, acting and

1185
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,640
interacting crappy crappy terminology.

1186
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Like

1187
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,119
>> I mean you're talking about how reefers

1188
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,520
are more like actors where they just

1189
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,839
they try to get people to interact with

1190
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,160
them or try to get people to get annoyed

1191
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,760
them. I've definitely seen actually it

1192
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,520
was last year we took game design but

1193
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,000
not not game inter uh 300 where we

1194
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,240
watched a video of briefers in uh Team

1195
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,800
Fortress 2 where there's a

1196
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,240
>> like there's a certain door that if they

1197
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,839
stand in a certain spot that it won't

1198
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,200
open. So this person started making

1199
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,319
everyone interact like, "Okay, we're

1200
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,079
going to play a game show. Do you want

1201
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:00,240
to leave? You have to answer correctly."

1202
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,839
>> Yeah. What is the capital of

1203
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,680
>> See, like that that I see that as more

1204
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,680
of like an explorer thing. Like you you

1205
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,960
found some some weird combination of the

1206
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,200
interaction and the mechanics that

1207
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,119
allows you to do something new,

1208
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,960
>> which is turn Team Fortress 2 into a

1209
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,640
game show.

1210
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,599
>> It was pretty funny.

1211
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,640
>> Can't fight.

1212
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,319
>> Grief Explorer is a combination of

1213
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,040
bubble types, right? if you're going to

1214
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,040
be a successful breeder.

1215
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,640
>> I mean, and and that's absolutely true,

1216
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,240
right? In all in order to be to if your

1217
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,839
personality is oriented one way, you may

1218
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,480
have to engage in some other behaviors

1219
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,079
in order to be able to

1220
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,680
in order to be able to maximize that

1221
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,680
that core behavior that you're looking

1222
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,599
for. So yeah, you know, people who are

1223
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,880
looking at exploits uh at at at try

1224
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,720
trying to understand how the world works

1225
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,880
so they can cause maximum damage and

1226
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,560
maximum grief to other people, you know,

1227
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,240
uh it's that's definitely one good way

1228
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,960
of doing it. But what I find is that as

1229
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,079
soon as they find it, they're not

1230
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:02,240
interested in finding more ways until

1231
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,640
that first way gets boring, you know,

1232
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,240
or or or gets fixed.

1233
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,839
So, Team Fortress, I know there's a lot

1234
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,920
of like teleporting you directly in

1235
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,280
front of turret and stuff like that.

1236
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,880
Teleporting your own teammates in front

1237
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,359
of turret. It's like

1238
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,920
that.

1239
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,680
>> I don't understand.

1240
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,800
>> You don't understand. What?

1241
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,839
>> It's grief.

1242
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,319
>> No, it's not actually fun.

1243
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,520
>> It's like I'm going to mess with you

1244
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,839
just for the hell of it. Um, I remember

1245
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,160
in Sims Online, an effective way to

1246
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,280
greet would be to organize a band of

1247
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,960
people and arrive in a property since

1248
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,599
there was a population limit.

1249
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,000
>> Mhm.

1250
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,040
>> Like 12 people or something on any given

1251
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,400
lot. If that lot was a business that

1252
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,319
required a lot of people to come through

1253
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,240
and then you just had 12 of your people

1254
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,240
show up and then like mill around and

1255
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,520
sell out profanities, you could tie the

1256
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,520
place and lock it up. No one else could

1257
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,040
go there, visit it, sometimes including

1258
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,760
other owners and stuff like that. It was

1259
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,200
very frustrating.

1260
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,160
>> Um, in fact, some of that behavior they

1261
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,720
got towards organized crime level

1262
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,000
actually. I mean, I would call it real

1263
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,440
crime. It was virtual. But um there

1264
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,480
there are actually good number of

1265
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,599
articles about the Sims online mafia

1266
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,119
because um that game had so much so much

1267
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,280
built in for actually for socializers um

1268
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,319
to be able to communicate, express

1269
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,240
yourself. I mean, if you played the

1270
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,440
original Sims, there's the whole range

1271
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,119
of different expressive things that you

1272
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,079
can do to sort of communicate how you're

1273
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,880
feeling and and uh and and to be able

1274
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,480
chatting with people. And um someone I

1275
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,319
think it might have been Max itself

1276
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,000
actually like charted out the web the

1277
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,200
web of influence of all the players and

1278
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,800
there was like one alpha player, you

1279
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,319
know, that was kind of in charge of

1280
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,560
everything. Uh and if and if she decided

1281
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,280
that nobody was going that that you know

1282
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,920
that this person was someone that she

1283
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,000
didn't want uh spending too much time

1284
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,480
with online because somehow pissed her

1285
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,520
off or or you know pissed one of her

1286
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,119
friends off or something and then she

1287
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,000
organized it like that very very

1288
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:12,000
effectively. Um it was called the second

1289
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,119
market. Uh and you get that in in you

1290
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,720
you'll get that similar behavior in

1291
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,720
second a lot. Um, but and it's kind of

1292
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,720
interesting to see how different worlds

1293
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,160
respond to that. Eve online, I think, is

1294
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,640
the world which is well actually one one

1295
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:31,599
thing I'd like to do is I like to throw

1296
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:34,079
different games up on that chart. Um, so

1297
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,319
um I am looking mostly at multiplayer

1298
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,559
games, specifically

1299
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,359
pre preferably online multiplayer games.

1300
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,800
Um, but and I don't know all all the

1301
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,480
games that are out there. So, I'd like

1302
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,800
people to like sort of call out games

1303
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,960
and tell me roughly where it should be

1304
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,640
put up. If you disagree, then by all

1305
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,720
means, put up your hand and suggest that

1306
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,480
it should be moved.

1307
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,240
>> Uh, Minecraft should go definitely

1308
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,520
towards like world interacting like

1309
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,119
explorer bit.

1310
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,800
>> You're far far.

1311
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,480
>> So, what is Minecraft? I've heard of it.

1312
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,160
I just don't know what exactly.

1313
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,839
>> Basically, go around mining things and

1314
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,440
creating objects and you can create like

1315
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,880
your own worlds. So it's kind of like I

1316
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,640
guess

1317
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,960
>> Eve is definitely a world interacting as

1318
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,160
well.

1319
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,400
>> Yeah.

1320
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,280
>> So about that same as Eve.

1321
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,000
>> Uh I would say Eve is also player

1322
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,480
interacting.

1323
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,960
>> Yeah. I mean I guess then I see it's in

1324
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,880
the middle then like you have to form

1325
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,520
corporations of bunches of people in

1326
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,319
order to do anything.

1327
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,000
>> That's true. You have to you have to be

1328
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,440
really good at social skills actually.

1329
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,680
Is that one of the games that's like

1330
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,680
most ruthless?

1331
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,280
>> Yeah, I interact with people and the

1332
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,680
world a lot.

1333
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,000
>> Like I think it's more strongly player

1334
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,559
interacting and world interacting than

1335
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,119
most games.

1336
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,040
>> You cannot you cannot ignore this in any

1337
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,359
particular

1338
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,880
>> but there's also like a huge amount of

1339
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,640
achievement and player versus player

1340
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,280
conflict and this kind of stuff, right?

1341
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,079
So clearly surely it shouldn't be that

1342
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,000
far down the interacting scale.

1343
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,319
I mean consider for instance Second Life

1344
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,200
instead which would be like way further

1345
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:19,880
down the interacting

1346
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,880
end of the spectrum online surely

1347
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,800
>> assuming that

1348
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:26,319
>> I'm not sure like PvP is the opposite.

1349
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,760
>> Yeah. No, I mean it's not

1350
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,480
>> I think it's definitely player

1351
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,040
interaction more than player action.

1352
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,559
>> Yeah, I believe something like having

1353
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,359
PvP tournaments I think would be

1354
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,119
definitely a lot of interaction. Yeah, I

1355
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,880
think that's that's like the distinction

1356
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,920
between griefing and like people

1357
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,760
fighting each other.

1358
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,760
>> Griefing can be interacting too. Like

1359
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,559
how he put it. I what I got from his

1360
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,240
article is that acting was like I go and

1361
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,680
kill someone and ha I killed them and

1362
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,200
that's it. Or I go through the world

1363
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,480
like I killed monster, I killed monster

1364
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,760
and you just have a goal and you want to

1365
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,040
get the goal instead of emerging from

1366
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,880
your goal. Um so I don't know. I

1367
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,119
definitely think there griefing can be

1368
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,960
hugely interactive. Like there could be

1369
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,720
a whole bunch of like if you in Eve if

1370
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,079
you infiltrate someone's company

1371
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,240
>> and you like steal$10.

1372
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,880
>> Exactly. Like that's hugely interactive

1373
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,079
griefing.

1374
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,599
>> But the briefing consider Team Fortress,

1375
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,359
right? Is Team Fortress player

1376
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,680
interacting because that means it's a

1377
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:24,240
socializer game.

1378
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,839
>> I I I personally do not think Team

1379
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,680
Fortress calls them a player

1380
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:32,640
interacting. Yes, but but um Left for

1381
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,880
Dead is

1382
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,920
>> uh

1383
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,440
>> definitely interaction.

1384
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,760
>> I would say probably more well it

1385
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,240
depends on what way you're doing.

1386
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,520
>> Horrible.

1387
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,280
>> So

1388
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,440
>> with Left for Dead, you can play you're

1389
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,079
interacting but then you're also like

1390
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,839
online you can go against other players

1391
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,160
who are actually the zombies against

1392
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,520
you.

1393
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,559
>> Right. So So let's talk about the basic

1394
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,319
mode where you don't have that.

1395
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,880
>> Yeah, that's about those modes

1396
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,599
separately.

1397
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:02,800
>> Yeah. Right. So the basic most common

1398
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,400
mode it's going to be four players

1399
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,079
playing cooperative cooperatively

1400
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,359
against the game world.

1401
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,079
>> Um

1402
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,760
>> that's just interacting world

1403
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,200
>> and

1404
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,839
there is

1405
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,680
a lot of interaction that goes on uh

1406
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,760
between players because you cannot

1407
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,160
basically survive unless you get keep

1408
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,440
each other's backs. So, I would say

1409
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,400
>> and there's and there's built-in Well,

1410
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,680
one second. And there's built-in

1411
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,800
functions to help other people. So,

1412
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,240
someone might get knocked off the ledge

1413
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,960
and be holding on. You have to pull it

1414
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,319
back up. Um, at the same time,

1415
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,000
>> at the same time, there's also an

1416
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,720
intelligent engine that sort of plans

1417
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,599
that level for you and places zombies

1418
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,839
strategically to maintain you in a state

1419
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,520
of nervousness. Um, and so it's

1420
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:48,240
different every single time you play.

1421
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,440
Uh, so those kind of balance out and

1422
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,880
probably place it somewhere in the

1423
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,119
middle. maybe a little bit more player

1424
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,119
bias than world bias because you really

1425
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,160
have to stick together.

1426
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,760
>> So, so it's weird because it almost like

1427
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,720
you want to have like a plane.

1428
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,480
>> It's in like Yeah.

1429
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,160
>> I think it' be Yeah. I think the big

1430
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,240
problem with this sort of graph is that

1431
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,960
you can't really necessarily separate

1432
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,839
games into one of these quadrants.

1433
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,760
>> Um

1434
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:17,359
>> games

1435
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,200
world and that is actually more

1436
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,440
interaction. It might be a little more

1437
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,359
useful to actually draw like areas

1438
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,839
within the graph to sort of like

1439
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:28,720
represent a game. I guess draw an area

1440
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,640
that encompasses like all the pieces the

1441
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,319
game sort of

1442
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,839
can be complicated with games that have

1443
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:39,200
very distinct modes, you know, like Halo

1444
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:41,280
co-op and Halo multiplayer and Halo

1445
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,520
Slayer very different.

1446
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,520
>> Uh but yeah,

1447
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,839
that will probably be a good refinement

1448
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,240
is just like create some sort of like

1449
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,440
scatter charts all over again

1450
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,280
>> because I could definitely see there

1451
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,359
being a game where there's a lot of

1452
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,040
acting on the world and interacting with

1453
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,040
players and if you're just separating

1454
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,640
you know these into distinct points that

1455
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,960
isn't possible with this graph

1456
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,599
>> right so that's another problem problem

1457
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:10,640
is the assumption that

1458
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:12,400
acting and interacting are like like

1459
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,319
mutually opposite at least for these two

1460
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,160
axes it almost seems like you know do

1461
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,640
people generally accept

1462
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,559
No, that one less than that interacting.

1463
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,839
>> If you just warp space and then you can

1464
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,839
have like different quadrants

1465
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,839
overlapping

1466
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,880
>> I think different values for like player

1467
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,480
world interacting and acting. They

1468
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,680
shouldn't necessarily be connected.

1469
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,880
>> I think Eve definitely world is very

1470
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,200
high and player is very high. World is

1471
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,480
very high. Player is very high. But as

1472
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:49,760
player is interacting and the world is

1473
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,480
active world,

1474
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,720
>> I mean because I mean you don't I mean

1475
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,319
you're exploring the world spatially a

1476
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,559
lot. Are you exploring the systems of

1477
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,559
the world or not or you really exploring

1478
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,480
the system by people?

1479
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,040
>> That's true.

1480
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,760
I mean the nice thing about um what you

1481
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,960
know things like uh EO 9 uh for folks

1482
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,079
who don't know EVA line is a space

1483
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,640
exploration game basically where uh

1484
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,920
where you start off as a captain correct

1485
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,839
me if I'm wrong or people

1486
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,359
>> pretty much a super sandbox game.

1487
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:23,599
>> Yeah. Well um but for the most part

1488
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,359
you're traveling in space that's that

1489
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,319
that you get out of your ship and like

1490
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,680
walk on foot.

1491
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,280
>> Have they added that? cuz I know they

1492
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,440
wanted to add an expansion where you

1493
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,280
could actually walk on planets. Last

1494
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,000
time I heard they hadn't.

1495
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,720
>> Last time I heard they had dust 66 or

1496
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,160
something like that.

1497
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,800
>> Yeah, which is a separate game.

1498
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,559
>> It's a separate game. So So no, you're

1499
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,839
traveling through space. You're not like

1500
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,359
landing anything. Uh but you're but the

1501
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,599
whole idea is that it's all built around

1502
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,319
this economy where you know you can do

1503
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,520
things like mining. Of course you and

1504
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,359
can cash. But the real power in in in in

1505
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,520
the game comes when players start to

1506
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,319
ally with each other. Form form armadas,

1507
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,359
form trade trade groups, you know, form

1508
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:07,280
areas that you can patrol and control uh

1509
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,760
uh and you know, areas where if you

1510
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,280
don't agree if you don't get along with

1511
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,599
the the people who are in control of the

1512
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,960
space, you will die once you fly there.

1513
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,960
And the only the only thing that's

1514
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,720
really making that happen are other

1515
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,359
players deciding that this social

1516
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,680
contract is is

1517
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,200
so it's pretty damn amazing. What uh

1518
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,160
some folks were talking about earlier

1519
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,880
was there was a big story about how um

1520
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,359
basically one person got into very very

1521
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,839
powerful position in one of these plants

1522
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:39,680
and decided to be back taking the

1523
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,920
majority of one uh of one plant's

1524
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,240
financial resources with that person.

1525
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,680
And remember, this is a this is a fairly

1526
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,079
modern people online game. All in game

1527
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,680
assets cannot be traded for real money.

1528
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,760
>> It's it's illegal. So that

1529
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,040
>> illegal like in game so you can get your

1530
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,640
account banned.

1531
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,599
>> But so what I so what happened was if I

1532
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,440
talking about the one that you're

1533
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,920
talking about, someone got to a really

1534
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,480
power place in like this banking clan

1535
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,760
and then took all of their assets and

1536
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,839
traded for real money. So got $10,000 by

1537
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,440
trading by selling it on

1538
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:16,079
One,

1539
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,839
>> one was a guy who infiltrated heck of a

1540
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,359
bunch of money. One was like a parent

1541
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:21,280
who was going through financial trouble

1542
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:24,240
and held like a fifth of the assets of

1543
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,200
some of like the major bank and cashed

1544
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,640
it in for like $6,000 to help pay off

1545
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,960
part of his house and like his kids

1546
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,559
medical bills and then posted a poly and

1547
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,160
quit the game.

1548
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,680
>> I thought you got banned from the game.

1549
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,720
>> He was banned from the game, but he he

1550
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,160
also quit the game.

1551
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,680
because there's no coffee.

1552
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,760
>> Yeah. He was like, "I'm sorry everybody,

1553
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,000
but uh this guy."

1554
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,319
>> I mean, the the amazing one was the guy

1555
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,200
who actually infiltrated the company and

1556
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:52,799
just like took it down as like a year

1557
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,160
years longer.

1558
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,839
>> He was their friend and all that.

1559
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,440
>> Yeah.

1560
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,520
Trying to get in and then managed to

1561
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,000
take down this gigantic in-game

1562
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,520
corporation.

1563
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,160
>> How many How many players are you

1564
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,359
online? Active players.

1565
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,480
>> No, I feel like active players are It

1566
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:13,040
sounds a lot moment.

1567
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,119
>> Yeah. No, I mean

1568
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,799
active we have active accounts.

1569
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:20,480
>> Are they are do they have like new

1570
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:21,839
players arriving regularly?

1571
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,880
>> They're the kind of game that's they've

1572
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:27,040
been like

1573
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,880
>> it's like a ridiculous learning curve.

1574
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,119
>> Yeah. It's like four months or

1575
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,880
something. It's insane. But it's uh but

1576
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,920
but the interesting thing about the

1577
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,240
particular case where someone

1578
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,240
infiltrated, took all their money and uh

1579
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,319
uh and and basically decimated uh this

1580
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,000
plan deliberately was that that person

1581
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,280
didn't actually give a compound for it.

1582
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,079
I believe it was like

1583
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,079
>> he was totally sell the most recent one

1584
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,480
I read about theoretically had the tens

1585
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,240
of thousands of US dollars of assets in

1586
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,760
the game and did not cash in any of it

1587
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,160
for real money because there is no

1588
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,319
authorized mechanism. And the article I

1589
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,440
read basically an end note was no one

1590
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,240
knows what you can do with it. He's

1591
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,720
technically rich but it's not there's no

1592
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,079
good legal mechanism of illegal gain

1593
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,319
allowed. I don't think he got banned at

1594
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,200
all because it's part of the game. is

1595
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:15,839
it's considered part of and and once and

1596
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,640
at least for the definition of Eve uh

1597
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,880
stories like that tends to have helped

1598
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,799
its reputation or anything as this is

1599
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,559
the this is this is the wild west in

1600
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,480
space you know and we're trying to

1601
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,720
encourage this kind of creative play

1602
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,000
>> and you know uh other than the real

1603
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,160
money transaction part where you get

1604
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,760
your content all that's part of the game

1605
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,520
so I'm not entirely sure it became

1606
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,680
really confident at griefing you know it

1607
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,680
was an incredibly smart practical

1608
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,920
>> see I I would not call that griefing

1609
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,920
Like it was not I mean it may have been

1610
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,520
done to like annoy the people who are

1611
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,040
running the company that he took down

1612
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,880
but like I see it as exploration like I

1613
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,160
am going to try and exploration and

1614
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,680
player interaction you know like

1615
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,280
>> I would say achieving because I mean

1616
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,920
a major corporation all by myself. Yeah,

1617
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,400
it might actually be

1618
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,400
do you put that in your resume like

1619
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,280
single-handedly?

1620
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,040
>> I think if you're

1621
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,000
>> we could get hired by a lawyer

1622
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,960
>> and you don't mind

1623
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,520
this company.

1624
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,040
>> So, okay. So, what I would actually like

1625
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:20,000
to end this um this with we've got about

1626
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,480
15 minutes um the special time I would

1627
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:27,440
say how how many here we have 1 2 3 4 5

1628
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:31,839
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 positive.

1629
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:34,480
Awesome. So, groups of four and uh what

1630
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,920
I'd like folks to do, am I doing this

1631
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,880
right?

1632
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,920
>> Yeah. Okay. And and um I'd like folks to

1633
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:45,680
come up with other axis. um you know not

1634
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:48,319
necessarily anything having to do with

1635
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,559
with with models. Just give me two

1636
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:54,160
things that you kind of feel are

1637
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:56,559
diametrically opposed but you know in

1638
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,480
describing a game or any series of games

1639
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,440
you could sort of like place games along

1640
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,200
some axis. Um, if you have time, we can

1641
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,359
talk about another two different terms,

1642
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,240
but you know, something to help describe

1643
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:09,760
to people, you know, okay, this game is

1644
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,920
kind of on the far extreme of one, this

1645
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,160
game is on the far extreme of the other.

1646
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,040
Um, the goal here is to come up with

1647
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,559
terms that are that will help you sort

1648
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,079
of identify what this who this game

1649
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,079
might be targeted towards, you know,

1650
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,160
what kind of player this game might be

1651
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,960
targeted. not necessarily using bottles

1652
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,559
terminology at all, you know, but borrow

1653
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,880
terminology as we have said is kind of

1654
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,960
weak. Uh so let's so let's throw out

1655
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,480
some some some other words, some other

1656
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,960
things. Use things that you use to

1657
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,040
describe games already, but you know if

1658
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,559
that fails because you haven't really

1659
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,160
thought about it that way. Come up with

1660
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:48,040
some new words, you know,

1661
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,040
>> real English words.

1662
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,480
Random versus strategy.

1663
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,829
[Music]

1664
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,200
Oh,

1665
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,200
>> original versus copy.

1666
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,040
>> Really? That's why it resonates, right?

1667
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:29,680
It makes it fairly sort of easy to sort

1668
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,040
of like discuss this, you know. I mean,

1669
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,799
I'd rather use the word trans, but

1670
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,799
randomly, you know, get the point across

1671
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,799
pretty clearly.

1672
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,960
>> Strategy or random versus deterministic,

1673
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:42,400
>> right? So I think that should be random

1674
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,640
deterministic and or reactive and

1675
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,799
deliberative.

1676
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,960
>> I like that.

1677
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:52,599
>> That's fancy.

1678
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,599
>> We use good words.

1679
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,400
>> Wait. So reactive and deliberative.

1680
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,799
and deliberate

1681
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,799
>> or random

1682
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,480
>> because you can definitely still have

1683
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,799
randomness and have strategy,

1684
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,640
>> right?

1685
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,400
>> But random deterministic.

1686
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,240
>> Yeah, then it'll be somewhere on the

1687
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,559
axis, right?

1688
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,680
>> So,

1689
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,960
>> well, I mean, the problem is you can

1690
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,680
have like incredible amounts of

1691
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,039
randomness, but if you're can just like

1692
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,640
figure out the probabilities, you can

1693
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,359
still have like an optimal strategy,

1694
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,720
right?

1695
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:26,559
>> But then that's rander. Deterministic is

1696
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:29,760
because you can't have a system that's

1697
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,359
so complex yet deterministic that

1698
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,400
there's no way you can predict what's

1699
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,359
going to happen next.

1700
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,359
>> Yeah.

1701
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,359
>> Robot

1702
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:43,400
is theoretically possible. But uh but

1703
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,400
yeah, this is this is

1704
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:52,160
>> player versus system agency. player

1705
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:54,720
versus Oh, so system player is a system

1706
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,480
and agency is kind of your it's

1707
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,280
distributed.

1708
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,599
>> It's a name of your of your tactics,

1709
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,960
right?

1710
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,359
>> Yes.

1711
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,319
>> You also had low learning curve versus

1712
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:10,520
high learning curve.

1713
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:10,520
>> Definitely not into that.

1714
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,760
>> Fast versus slow.

1715
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,480
So,

1716
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:28,960
>> so another learning another uh axis we

1717
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:33,039
had was um I guess if you call it

1718
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:36,640
the like freedom and like the

1719
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,920
predetermined like paths in the game,

1720
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,880
>> huh?

1721
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,680
>> Constraint.

1722
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,440
>> Yeah. Well,

1723
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,280
>> freedom versus constraint. Yeah, I can't

1724
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:47,200
remember the terms. Was it like glutus

1725
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,440
and py or something like that?

1726
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,079
>> Well, okay. So, one word that I use that

1727
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,240
I hear often to some describe games on

1728
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,039
rails.

1729
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,640
>> Yes.

1730
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:02,760
>> Um I mean

1731
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,760
13 hours of Final Fantasy

1732
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:12,240
unreal. You get to do one thing, you get

1733
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,240
to push the X button for 60 hours.

1734
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:24,400
I would say a subset of what you're

1735
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,319
talking about, but it's a very broad

1736
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,960
one. It's one that people generally

1737
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:32,319
understand as embodying this sort of

1738
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:34,000
like freedom like you you get to dig

1739
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:37,200
around basically, right? You know, you

1740
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
get to play Grand Theft Auto totally not

1741
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,400
following the story line and you know As

1742
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,559
time goes on, it becomes a little bit

1743
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,160
less of that. You can you get to do less

1744
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,000
crazy things. But the whole idea is that

1745
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,160
that world has ramps everywhere so that

1746
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,359
you can drive cars and vehicles and

1747
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,640
anything.

1748
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,720
>> Okay. Anything else?

1749
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:57,119
>> Uh there's like realism versus

1750
01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:00,000
abstraction.

1751
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,920
>> What something? So, so like the the

1752
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,359
difference between you know like Eve

1753
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,839
Online for example which is supposed to

1754
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:08,720
be very realistic simulating something

1755
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:10,240
whereas poker for example is just cards

1756
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,960
and numbers

1757
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,200
>> something on the on the freedom sand box

1758
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,039
versus preturn on rails there's a very

1759
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,440
interesting thing in uh at least I've

1760
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,200
seen it done in Balders game too there's

1761
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,960
a pre-triven point in the game where you

1762
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,880
are told you need x amount of money to

1763
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,319
be able to pay for the ship out of here

1764
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,319
and you're placed in a sort of sandbox

1765
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,839
environment and you are given

1766
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,440
It is not you're not told that you can

1767
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,720
have whatever ways you can think of to

1768
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,839
make that amount of money whichever

1769
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,880
amount of money you can leave that part

1770
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,280
of the game.

1771
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,440
>> So it's a predetermined sandbox section.

1772
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,039
>> No I mean yeah I mean if it's a you know

1773
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,119
a lot of adventure games a lot of role

1774
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:46,559
playing games are largely predetermined

1775
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:49,280
with areas of of freedom. Even in a game

1776
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,520
like Final Fantasy maybe not 13 but in

1777
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,000
in in other games in the in the series

1778
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,559
the story is largely predetermined but

1779
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,799
what you do in combat is very very

1780
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,079
fluid. uh you know and and that's kind

1781
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:04,079
of like the the dichotomy that those

1782
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,039
that square

1783
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,599
and in the past kind of decided that

1784
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,000
that was okay. This helps us cater to

1785
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,680
people who want some flexibility in how

1786
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,359
they're going to play by making the

1787
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:19,200
combat system fluid enough that they can

1788
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:21,520
do play they want as but also lets us

1789
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,559
cater to the people who really want that

1790
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,720
that long overarching epic narrative you

1791
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:31,440
know and we can only we can only create

1792
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:34,400
one we can branch into different because

1793
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,160
so that's

1794
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,359
>> there others

1795
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:42,359
I mean might be a

1796
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,359
figure

1797
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:49,000
there's only one way to do it whereas

1798
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
sol

1799
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,520
you you could have multiple solutions

1800
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,559
and

1801
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,559
>> you know solution

1802
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,280
that tells you

1803
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,520
the game is catered to it Can I tell you

1804
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,039
something about the constraints on the

1805
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,200
budget of the

1806
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:16,520
>> No, I would I mean I prefer games that

1807
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,520
are much more

1808
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,799
>> right because the the interesting thing

1809
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,679
about multiple solutions to single

1810
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:26,799
solutions and multiple solutions

1811
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:30,480
um it could be all design like I I could

1812
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:33,279
design in a game in fact if you play DSX

1813
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,359
uh or any of the sequels uh they

1814
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,880
specifically stated that they made this

1815
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:42,719
game with multiple solutions in mind and

1816
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,960
for DSX 2 they designed it so that um

1817
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,960
they thought this puzzle needs kind of

1818
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,600
three solutions and they actually will

1819
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,520
design the environment for it. So while

1820
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,120
the game kind of like touted it as you

1821
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,199
know you get to play with the system you

1822
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,239
get to you know figure out how all these

1823
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:58,719
things combine and come up with

1824
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:01,120
solutions at your own really that they

1825
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:04,000
tried to like design it so that you have

1826
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:06,000
three very clear options but they wanted

1827
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,319
people to realize that they had options

1828
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,560
and so you can have multiple solutions

1829
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:13,679
whereas like freedom sandboxing kind of

1830
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,359
implies not necessarily design like you

1831
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,880
know you got lot lots of little things

1832
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,319
that you can do and lots of different

1833
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,120
spaces that you can explor

1834
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,799
But u it's not like um you've got one

1835
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,359
obstacle and three different ways to

1836
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,239
solve it. You've got all kinds of

1837
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,960
different things that you could be

1838
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:30,480
doing. You could be like choosing not.

1839
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,000
So these are different axis. I just want

1840
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:36,520
to point out that these are different

1841
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,520
ways to different things.

1842
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,759
>> Um you can have in terms of rule

1843
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:41,520
changing games whether it's dynamic

1844
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,920
rules or static rules.

1845
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:49,279
>> Okay. So so

1846
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,279
uh I'll put dynamic static and

1847
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,440
Are the rules going to change in the

1848
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:59,640
game? Yeah, that's there are some games

1849
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,640
over here. The whole point is change

1850
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,120
versus

1851
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,360
>> the rules.

1852
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,360
>> We had this before and then PvP version.

1853
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,440
time scale of decisions.

1854
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,239
>> So short model.

1855
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,920
>> Yeah. Like Twitch games versus games

1856
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:28,719
>> contemplate decisions.

1857
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,199
>> Sort of like contemplative and reactive.

1858
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,800
>> How is that compared to reactive? Is

1859
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,880
that are you guys going for basically

1860
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,880
the same thing? Like reactive means

1861
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,040
things are coming at you and you have to

1862
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,960
respond really really quickly. Maybe not

1863
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,600
even about it. And deliberate is like

1864
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,199
like a turnbased game.

1865
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,040
as much time as you want to think about

1866
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,880
how long you want to make a decision.

1867
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,159
Doesn't necessarily mean that, you know,

1868
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,040
you can have a turnbased game that's

1869
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:57,520
very fastpaced, you know, uh because the

1870
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:01,040
the weight of any given decision is not

1871
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,199
going to be so huge. So pace, you know,

1872
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,000
I'm I'm just going to put pace up here

1873
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:10,199
because

1874
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,199
you know, slow and fast,

1875
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:16,239
you know, as one way of describing the

1876
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:19,199
game, uh uh reactive versus libertous

1877
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:22,239
a related way of starting game. I bet

1878
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:26,239
you could take like two of these and put

1879
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:27,600
them on axis and then you can

1880
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,280
but you know I guess every once in a

1881
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,800
while you find that game that you like

1882
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,239
both here and here at the same time

1883
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,199
which is fine. It's just not a way to

1884
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,719
talk about these things.

1885
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,679
Okay,

1886
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:45,000
these are really really useful terms uh

1887
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,000
better than

1888
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,520
is more

1889
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,280
>> a little bit more boxing.

1890
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,280
It's a little bit more restrictive than

1891
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,760
freedom

1892
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:07,360
is more like values that box on rails

1893
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:10,400
are more like back of the box. you know

1894
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:12,000
the future

1895
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,239
really

1896
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,239
you wouldn't
