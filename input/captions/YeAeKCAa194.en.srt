1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,279
Fusion energy is sort of a miraculous

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,919
solution um in some ways to our energy

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,330
problem um once we figure out uh all the

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:15,120
engineering challenges to it.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:20,160
[Music]

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,279
It's able to provide uh clean energy um

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,359
with a virtually unlimited fuel source

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,720
which is hydrogen. It can be turned on

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,519
at any time which is its advantage over

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,719
um other energy sources such as uh

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,880
renewables. I am working on uh additive

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
manufacturing which is metal 3D printing

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,200
to help advance fusion energy by

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,360
manufacturing key components with more

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
specialized materials which are suitable

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,680
for the extreme environments which

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,840
fusion energy must be produced. 3D

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,520
printing allows for the use of more

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,399
specialized alloys such as this NASA

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,280
alloy which has high strength at high

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,640
temperatures. I was interested in fusion

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,879
energy because to me it's sort of at the

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,880
intersection of two areas that I'm very

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,520
interested in which is physics and

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,240
engineering. I really enjoy this work

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,479
because um I love tinkering with things

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,360
like 3D printers. something I can design

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,000
on my computer can be in my hands. That

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,000
brings me a lot of joy.
