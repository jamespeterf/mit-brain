1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
And um and now finally, last but not

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,200
least, we have Anelise Maya who's um

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,210
from MAT Hoy joint joint program. Take

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:24,969
it away, Anelise.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:24,969
[Applause]

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,120
Who are you? Really think about that for

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,160
a

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,399
second. Now, I don't want to give anyone

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,879
an existential crisis just yet. So, I'll

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,879
give you an

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,399
answer. This is you. You're around 30

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,680
trillion human cells all stuck together.

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,640
Now add 38 trillion microbial cells to

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,159
your self-image. Those 38 trillion

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
microbes are spread throughout almost

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,600
every part of your body, but the vast

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,119
majority are located in your digestive

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,479
tract. Given that slightly over half the

19
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,640
cells in your body belong to your

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,479
microbial roommates, it perhaps isn't

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,159
surprising that keeping those roommates

22
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,360
happy is critical for your overall

23
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,920
health. Dispiosis or an imbalance in the

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,680
community composition of your gut

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,439
microbiome affects every system in your

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
body. It's linked to everything from

27
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,840
acid reflux to Crohn's disease to

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,479
cardiac disease, even depression,

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
schizophrenia, and

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,159
Parkinson's. These aren't tentative

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,759
correlations either. A recent reanalysis

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,640
paper showed that across multiple

33
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,759
disease types, significant alteration in

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,000
species richness and diversity occurred.

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
Now, while microbiome changes can be a

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,399
result of many things things,

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,280
environmental effects, diet, stress,

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,560
genetics, etc., we also know that these

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,920
links to disease aren't even just

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,399
correlative. Multiple studies have shown

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
that disease phenotypes can be induced

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,479
by replicating the disease associated

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,200
microbiome in an otherwise healthy

44
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,120
individual. In a notable case,

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
depression was induced in rats that were

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
grown in a micro-free environment by

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,319
inoculating them with the fecal

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,720
microbiome from depressed

49
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,640
humans. From acid reflux to anxiety,

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Bbots are here to

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,160
help. Bots are tiny autonomous machines

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
that act sort of like synthetic

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,239
superpowered probiotics. These tiny

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,760
machines integrate into your gut

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
microbiome.

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,120
Depending on the type of Bbot, they

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
might set up shop in your stomach, small

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
intestine, or colon. There they perform

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,879
the chemical reactions that your gut

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,200
micro microbiome needs to get back on

61
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,720
track. Bots are inspired by nature.

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,319
These reactions are performed by

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,879
proteins just like they are by the

64
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,920
microbes inside you. Unlike in those

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,080
microbes, our proteins are ultra stable.

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,760
Years of testing and modifications to

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
the protein sequence ensures that once

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,239
you swallow the capsules containing your

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,040
Bbots, the proteins we've packed in can

70
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,239
do their job for

71
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,480
years. Though they're located in the

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
gut, different Bbots are curated to

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,480
perform reactions that benefit many body

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,400
systems. I'll give you a couple

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,239
examples.

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,080
In the stomach, Bbots might perform

77
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,640
reactions needed to synthesize vitamin

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
B12, release compounds that will inhibit

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,680
helicoacttor pylori, or stimulate the

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,840
growth of lactobacillus acidophilus.

81
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,159
Bbots can even add new functionalities

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
to your microbiome. One of the most

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,200
popular is a Bbot that can produce

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,720
fotadine and sissue. Fotadine is the

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,040
active ingredient in Pepsid. There's

86
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,080
some in my bag. It's a proven way to

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,000
control acid reflux. Vitamin B12 is

88
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,640
critical for many bodily functions and

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,319
statistically probably I said 20 but I

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,920
think it's going to be more like 30 uh

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,000
30 of us in this room have insufficient

92
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,400
levels. H pylori is the causitive act u

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,400
agent for most stomach ulcers but

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,640
lactobacillus acidophilus on the other

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
hand can help reduce the bloating and

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,439
nausea associated with IBS and lactose

97
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,200
intolerance among other things.

98
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,959
Now, I'm sure all the grad students in

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
this room want to hear what Bbots can do

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,840
for the brain because I don't think

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,199
anyone makes it through grad school

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,959
without developing crushing

103
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,880
anxiety. Bbots stimulate and in some

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,840
cases perform synthesis of compounds

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,400
like short chain fatty acids, indole3

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,240
propionogic acid, GABA and pilo lactose.

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,479
The role of these metabolites is

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,120
complex, but in the right amounts they

109
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,080
can reduce central nervous system

110
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,479
inflammation, increase bloodb brain

111
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,759
barrier integrity, prevent degradation

112
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,720
of neurons, and balance

113
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,800
neurotransmitters. These all serve to

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,440
alleviate anxiety and depression. They

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,360
can make ADHD symptoms more manageable,

116
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,720
prevent neurodeenerative degenerative

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,479
disease, among other

118
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,880
things. Okay, the biochemistry is mostly

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,160
over, I promise. So let's switch over to

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,840
the mechanics of how Bbots work. So this

121
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
is an image of some Bbots that'll take

122
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
up residence in your stomach. So note

123
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,759
the scale. Bbots are about the same size

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,280
as most of the other microbes in your

125
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,120
gut. These strings at the end are

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,000
fimbria and they allow specific

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,560
attachment to in this example the mucosa

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,560
cells that line the

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,080
stomach. This honeycomb texture prevents

130
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,199
other microbes from tethering to them

131
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,120
and interfering with their function.

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,360
Bbots are ready to go when you receive

133
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,720
them. Once you ingest the capsules

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,680
they're stored in, they'll find their

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
spots in your gut and get to

136
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,919
work. Let's quickly run through the

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
simplified BBOT diagram. So, here are

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,919
those attachment fibria we've already

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,120
discussed. In the middle is the energy

140
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,199
source for Bbots. Using chemical energy

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
like real microbes do requires too much

142
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,560
metabolic flexibility. Instead, we've

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,280
designed this tiny energy harvester. It

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,560
uses pzo electric energy. So that means

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,320
it gleans uh energy from vibrations.

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,880
We've designed it to be able to respond

147
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,720
to a large number of frequencies

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,759
enabling it to get sufficient energy

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
just from your natural

150
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,520
movement. Those cloudy shapes are the

151
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,280
protein catalysts. Depending on the

152
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,520
type, some might be docked on the BBOT

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,240
membrane, others free floating, and

154
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,680
still others linked to the energy

155
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,240
harvester. The latter proteins need an

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
energy input to do their job. When the

157
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,160
desired substrate comes in through these

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,199
transporter pores,

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,639
uh, it brings these two protein subunits

160
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,160
together. Proteins are conductive, so

161
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,080
we've keyed these to undergo the

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,280
confirmational change needed to do the

163
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,520
reaction when a current passes through.

164
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,520
The last few components are engaged only

165
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,120
when deactivation of a Bbot is

166
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,280
required. If a user decides they no

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,639
longer want a certain BBOT, they can go

168
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,639
into the Handy User app and trigger its

169
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,080
deactivation. Of course, consumer uh

170
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,960
customer support can also do this

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
remotely if

172
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,080
necessary. There are three simple

173
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,319
components needed for deactivation. The

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,880
Bluetooth receiver, a lipid vesicle

175
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,520
holding signal peptides, and a receptor

176
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,039
attached to the polar

177
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,599
fimria. First, the Bluetooth signal is

178
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,440
received from the user app that allows

179
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,479
an electric pulse to be transferred from

180
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,400
the energy harvester to the vesicle.

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,360
that then disrupts the lipid membrane

182
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,360
allowing the peptides inside to

183
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,720
escape. The signal peptides bind to the

184
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
dissolution receptor and that uh binding

185
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,080
lets the receptor start a cascade that

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,720
results in the dissolution of those

187
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
attachment fimria. Once the Bbot is

188
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
loose, it'll be flushed from the body

189
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,840
like food

190
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,160
waste. Okay, thanks for holding on

191
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,319
through that sprint introduction to

192
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,400
Bbots. But we here at BBOT Incorporated

193
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,319
aren't just here to offer you a nature

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,800
inspired single dose treatment that can

195
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,599
be customized to fit your needs. That's

196
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,080
not enough for us. We're continually

197
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,919
pushing the envelope. For example, due

198
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,879
to our recent breakthrough, we're

199
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,039
offering new Love Bugs Bots. They

200
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,800
augment your natural pherommones just to

201
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,599
give you that extra sparkle out there.

202
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,919
We've also developed uh specialized BBOT

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,400
mixes that emphasize efficient nutrient

204
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,319
extraction from poor quality diets and

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,120
we offer them at a subsidized rate to

206
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,599
low-income families. Just doing our part

207
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,960
to help fight food insecurity in

208
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:25,319
America. Okay, give me a sec to let me

209
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,160
my break

210
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,479
character. In my piece presubscribe, we

211
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,240
opened on a young scientist named Katie

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,080
as she presents Bbots to various

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,760
possible

214
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,599
investors. If I was trying to leave here

215
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
with all of you having in committed

216
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,519
money to my new BB bots venture, I'd

217
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
probably stop the presentation

218
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,560
here. However, that's not what I'm here

219
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
to do. I don't need to explain to this

220
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
audience that all technology comes with

221
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
drawbacks and social and ethical

222
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
complications. For example, this behind

223
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,360
me, uh, those are the terms and

224
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,240
conditions for the Amazon

225
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,120
Alexa. Yikes. In presubscribe, we meet

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Brier, a young man from Ellensburg,

227
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,920
Washington. Throughout this piece, he

228
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,240
experiences some of the major benefits

229
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,640
of Bbots. Brier elected for their

230
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,880
balance mix to address his anxiety and

231
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,320
recurrent panic attacks, but then

232
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,560
unfortunately discovers how the

233
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,320
magnitude of those benefits might serve

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,080
to amplify the drawbacks of medical

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,080
technology when it's controlled by

236
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
corporate

237
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,200
interests. It's no secret that

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,839
privatized for-profit medical industry

239
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,800
in the US propate propagates systemic

240
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,200
inequities. Health in health outcomes

241
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,920
for marginalized groups for even routine

242
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
pro procedures are significantly worse

243
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
than they are for white wealthy

244
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,760
cisgender people and these statistics

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,720
will undoubtedly continue to worsen

246
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,560
given the policy changes we're seeing

247
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,480
today in presubscribe I touch on a few

248
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,920
separate factors that come into play

249
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,760
because of the for-profit nature of

250
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,519
bbots first I question how regulatory

251
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,080
bodies will regulate technology like

252
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,000
bbots that to some degree transcend

253
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
traditional

254
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,200
categories. Here, bubots are marketed

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,240
effectively as a supplement, so they

256
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,680
don't require the same level of FDA

257
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,120
approval. They can be put to market much

258
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,920
more quickly and don't require

259
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,040
prescription or costly doctor's

260
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,320
appointments. However, supplements are

261
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,000
rarely covered by insurance

262
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,480
providers. Secondly, industrial

263
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,240
innovation require relies on patents.

264
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,640
Patents provide protection and thus

265
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,640
safer profitability for 20 years once

266
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,320
initiated. and strategic modifications

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,760
to the technology can enable effective

268
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,079
extensions. The ethics of patents in the

269
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,399
medical world aside, it does mean that

270
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,920
in the early days of Bbots, meaningful

271
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,360
competition would be easily

272
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,360
nullified. However, the main focus of

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,880
this piece rests on the decision to

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,079
convert access to Bbots to a

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,839
subscription model. Given the meteoric

276
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,360
success of the subscription economy,

277
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
this probably seems like a logical

278
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
choice and one that might seem logical

279
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,320
to consumers given that we already pay

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,560
monthly for our prescriptions among a

281
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,000
myriad of other

282
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,959
things. Subscription services offer a

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,760
guise of affordability. What's $8.99 a

284
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,760
month for unlimited streaming, right?

285
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,000
However, incremental price increases are

286
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,959
a near ubiquitous practice among subs

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,200
subscription services. Even if advanced

288
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,680
notice is obstensively provided, these

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,240
changes are often missed by subscribers.

290
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,839
For example, how many of you have

291
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,360
Netflix? Netflix just increased. Thank

292
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,000
you. Uh its standard plan rate to $17.99

293
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,680
a month this year, and our regular

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
prescription drugs aren't exempt from

295
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,720
these sorts of cost increases.

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,920
The top 25 Medicare Part D drugs have

297
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,920
about doubled in price since market

298
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,839
launch and 21% of US adults have

299
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,959
foregone necessary prescriptions because

300
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,760
of the cost. Now, Bbots aren't Netflix

301
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,680
and nor are they your daily SSRI.

302
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,839
However, in presubscribe, the monthly

303
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,640
cost of Brian's Bbots follow the same

304
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,240
trend. And like many of us, Brian wasn't

305
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,000
keeping a close eye on the automatic

306
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,640
withdrawals for what he thought would be

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,320
a consistent monthly expense. It wasn't

308
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,240
until he received notice of failed

309
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,480
payment from the company and a warning

310
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
of imminent termination without payment

311
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,959
that he realized the price had rocketed

312
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,800
out of range of his budget. The

313
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,200
Bluetooth enabled termination pathway of

314
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Bbots grants the company unfettered

315
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,839
ability to do just that. Terminate with

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,760
limited notice and recourse in a way

317
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,600
that's less like cancelling Hulu and

318
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,560
more akin to the bank repossessing your

319
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,399
house and then burning it

320
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,399
down. Briar's Bbots had been effective.

321
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,800
His baseline anxiety was minimal and

322
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,880
flare-ups were manageable. Like all

323
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
Bbots, they performed critical functions

324
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,800
within his stabilized microbiome and

325
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,880
were efficient producers of important

326
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,360
cellular

327
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,720
metabolites. Those Bbots may by

328
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,240
necessity end up being the primary

329
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
source of some of these important

330
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,639
metabolites.

331
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
So each circle here represents a microbe

332
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
and each line that connects them

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,399
indicates a relationship based on one or

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,279
more

335
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,279
metabolites. Especially if those

336
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,920
metabolites produced by Bbots have

337
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,839
widespread downstream uses, other

338
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,720
microbes in the ecosystem can become

339
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,639
dependent on Bbots for these products.

340
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,560
This can result in Bbots becoming a

341
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,600
central node in that the metabolic

342
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,760
network, a keystone if you will.

343
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,440
If you suddenly remove the keystone, you

344
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,519
lose the source of those products and

345
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,320
the functions needed to keep the e

346
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,040
ecosystem stable and functioning. As a

347
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,279
result, the ecosystem falters or might

348
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,800
even collapse, leaving it vulnerable to

349
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,079
replacement by an unhealthy disbiotic

350
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,760
system. This would manifest as

351
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,519
aggressive, long-asting withdrawal

352
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,120
effects. After Brier's BBOT were

353
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,880
deactivated, his anxiety returned worse

354
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,120
than ever, accompanied by depressive

355
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,880
symptoms, severe cramping, bloating, and

356
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,120
nausea. If you stop paying, no company

357
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,200
that I know of would offer to slowly

358
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,399
wean you off, connect you to a doctor to

359
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,760
manage the transition, and find cheaper

360
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,040
alternatives. Presubscribe ends with a

361
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,399
statement from one of the founders of

362
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,399
the company. Dr. Badachara severed ties

363
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,800
with Bbots shortly after they introduced

364
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
their subscription

365
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,639
model. Bbots were never going to be a

366
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,399
oneanddone cure. They're closer to a

367
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,160
prosthetic, a pacemaker for your gut. No

368
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,440
company should be able to suddenly turn

369
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,440
that off if you can't make a payment one

370
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,839
month. I still think that BBOT can and

371
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,120
will do a lot of good if they're put in

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,650
the hands of those that aren't in it for

373
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:43,010
the profit. Thank you.

374
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:43,010
[Applause]

375
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,920
Yeah. Uh, super interesting. So, I guess

376
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,839
to first to start this question, I will

377
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,000
divulge my medical history. So, I have

378
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,639
an autoimmune condition as do something

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,800
like 10% of all Americans. So, it's

380
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,120
actually really common. And one of the

381
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,320
annoying things about that is as you get

382
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,399
older oftentimes certain foods no longer

383
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,560
agree with you. Um, and it turns out

384
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,560
it's really hard to figure out what

385
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,600
exactly might be the issue because if

386
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,120
you think about it, you know, you like

387
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,240
eat a piece of pizza, you don't know

388
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
like all a sudden your stomach hurts.

389
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,639
You're like, "All right, is it the

390
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,160
cheese? Is it the gluten? Is it the

391
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,560
garlic? Is it the onions?" You know, you

392
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,480
don't know. So, um, I'm wondering if you

393
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,480
think Bbots instead of just being able

394
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,320
to use to treat something could also

395
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,320
have a use to diagnose as well.

396
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,920
Yeah, that's a great question and I

397
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,440
guess a great suggestion. Um, I think

398
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,720
there's definitely a possibility for

399
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,600
that. Uh I would imagine that that would

400
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,720
have to do with kind of characterizing

401
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,040
which metabolites might accumulate that

402
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
aren't being processed as they should uh

403
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,440
either by your microbiome that for some

404
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
reason isn't being you know maintained

405
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,600
by your

406
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:00,880
uh body as it is um

407
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,360
or you know just like by your ability of

408
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,759
your cells to process those ingredients.

409
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,880
However, I think at the moment our

410
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:12,839
understanding of the kind of

411
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,440
metabolic structure of the gut

412
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,199
microbiome isn't quite advanced enough

413
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,480
that we could say, "Okay, we're seeing

414
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,199
you that seeing that you have an

415
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,759
accumulation of

416
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:25,600
fructose. That means that you need to

417
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,880
cut out these things." Something like

418
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,839
that might actually be a little bit

419
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,639
simpler. It might be okay, you cut out

420
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,639
apples. Um, but for anything beyond kind

421
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,959
of a general intolerance, I don't know

422
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,440
that we're there yet. Um, but I

423
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,759
definitely think we could get there.

424
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Great.

425
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,079
Thank you for for that. And I I sort of

426
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,800
share your sense of some of the the

427
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,120
pitfalls of technologies like this in a

428
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,880
for-profit health care system. But I I

429
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
wonder if you could say a bit about how

430
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,000
things look in a not for-profit

431
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,720
healthare system. So there's still going

432
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,279
to be limited resources and there will

433
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,039
be kind of decisions about in investment

434
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,120
in kind of speculative potentially uh

435
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,000
resource in startup resource intensive

436
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,439
technologies like this versus proven

437
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,559
technologies that might be distributed

438
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,480
more widely. So could you say

439
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:21,039
like how you see the the sort of ethical

440
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,439
scenario of things like this playing out

441
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,360
uh potentially better or maybe not in in

442
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,079
that kind of not for-profit uh

443
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,320
environment. Yeah, definitely. So, full

444
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,559
disclosure, uh I'm Canadian. I grew up

445
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,559
with universal healthcare and I think

446
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,760
something like this and you know, most

447
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,760
things would work much better in that

448
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,600
environment.

449
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,160
Um I think for this to work out the best

450
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,400
way it possibly could would be for it to

451
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,760
probably start in an academic

452
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,520
environment and kind of stay within that

453
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,520
for much of the development.

454
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,720
um

455
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,720
the at least within Canada the funding

456
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,679
available for research is in general

457
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,679
much smaller than it is in the US and

458
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
you know the venture capital is just not

459
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,039
there in the same way which does make

460
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,360
that sort of development more difficult.

461
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,039
Um but I think if there were you know

462
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,640
governmental

463
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:22,919
uh regulations in place that stipulated

464
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,600
if you are creating a medical technology

465
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:29,840
um first that it must

466
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,120
undergo rigorous classification as to

467
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,640
you know what we class this is. So Bbots

468
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,400
I think you could get through as a

469
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,200
supplement but they really aren't. Um,

470
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,919
and if you had to do uh once you've kind

471
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,160
of determined what it is, if you're

472
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,799
going to do some sort of clinical trial,

473
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,400
it has to be paired with multiple

474
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,320
academic labs that maintain a connection

475
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,440
throughout the entire process. Something

476
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,440
like that.

477
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Great.

478
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,000
Thanks. I think I want to ask a question

479
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,919
about the economics rather than the

480
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,919
technology. So, oh no.

481
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,919
Um,

482
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,080
so the beat bots are developed by a

483
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,440
for-profit company that presumably

484
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,200
wouldn't have been incentivized to

485
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,240
develop it if there had been no prospect

486
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,960
of making money off of

487
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:31,039
it. And so I'm not really sure

488
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,320
what you're describing some some bad

489
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,480
thing that goes on when they increase

490
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,440
the price. And I agree it's bad when

491
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,360
prices go up,

492
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,120
but there's a reason. When prices go up,

493
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,720
it incentivizes other companies to get

494
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,559
into the market or develop alternative

495
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
technologies. And if there's no profits

496
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,760
to be made from healthcare innovations,

497
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,559
then things like this won't be invented

498
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,440
in the first place. So, I just feel like

499
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,200
you're being a little bit too uh

500
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,600
throwing too much shade on the profit

501
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,880
motive. You can never throw too much

502
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,400
shade on the profit motive. Um, no, I

503
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,799
mean it's a good point and the question

504
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,559
of um, for example, patents in the

505
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
medical

506
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,400
industry goes back and forth kind of on

507
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,960
that point. Is it giving a monopoly or

508
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,960
is it actually inciting competition and

509
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,240
iteration? And I think most schools of

510
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,919
thought land on the latter that, you

511
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,960
know, patents are important. Um, and

512
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,960
that's in terms of, you know,

513
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,200
profitability. That's kind of why I do

514
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,039
think it should start from an academic

515
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,360
setting and be linked to that throughout

516
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
development because there is motivation

517
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,600
that isn't just how much money can we

518
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,280
pump out of this and then once it

519
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,840
becomes

520
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,679
um something that is produced by a

521
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,080
company but regulated um and dispensed

522
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,080
by the

523
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,760
government then you know prices might

524
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,440
still go up but that's not landing on

525
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,360
the consumer.

526
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,200
and you're not putting consumers in a

527
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,039
place where they have

528
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,679
to see if they can make that every

529
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,480
month, which I know is the case with all

530
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,640
prescriptions in countries that have

531
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:19,120
non-universal healthcare. Um, I think BB

532
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:22,280
bots just kind of take that to a a next

533
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,720
level of what that would look like.

534
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:30,400
Um, I do recognize the

535
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,240
I think the underlying question is an

536
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,000
extremely debated one. So, I'm really

537
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,360
only offering my opinion there. Um, but

538
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,720
I do think it

539
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,720
is it's an important thing to consider

540
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,520
all sides and I definitely don't want to

541
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,799
discount that.

542
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,320
I disagree. Uh, I think profit is bad.

543
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,880
So, you know, I think you're right. Um

544
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,760
so my question is actually about

545
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,400
um not about capitalism at all. Uh it's

546
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,000
about um if you think about maybe

547
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,159
something similar which is insulin

548
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,559
pumps, right? Insulin pumps are a

549
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,720
fantastic technology um that keep lots

550
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,559
of people alive. There's a whole sub

551
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,320
community of people who hack their

552
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,720
insulin pumps because they don't like

553
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,240
the schedule that it's on, right? And

554
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,760
they've noticed it doesn't work well for

555
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,159
them, right? And so there's whole

556
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,679
subcommunities of patient advocates that

557
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,080
hack them and try to make sure that the

558
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,559
insulin delivery works well for them,

559
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
right? Which has dangers, right? But

560
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,039
there's a lot of people who are very

561
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,360
happy with that. Um, you could also

562
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,320
imagine somebody, especially if it's

563
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,080
Bluetooth enabled, hacking a device and

564
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,240
having it do something really bad to

565
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,159
you, right? So not the company, right?

566
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,039
But, you know, a person who wants to do

567
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:51,039
something bad. Um, do you have any

568
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,799
thoughts on how you can maybe uh make

569
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,480
technologies that are acting in your

570
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,440
body like we already have for insulin

571
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,120
pumps safe to this kind of sabotage

572
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,240
hacking? I mean, hospitals are already

573
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,640
held hostage by hackers, right? Yeah,

574
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,240
it's a great a great question.

575
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,320
Um, with Bbots, the way they're

576
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,120
currently designed, really the only

577
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,720
thing the user can do is turn them off.

578
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,280
And once they're off, they're out of

579
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,919
your body. Um, that's not to say that if

580
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,600
someone is turning them off willy-nilly,

581
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,760
there won't be adverse effects. Clearly,

582
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,799
we're seeing that when the company is

583
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,280
terminating them.

584
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,440
Um, however, I'd imagine in a case where

585
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,200
a user is choosing to terminate them

586
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,440
voluntarily,

587
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,280
um, there would be kind of safeguards in

588
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,840
place and suggestions that you contact

589
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,559
customer support on how best to do that.

590
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,039
Um, so because the Bbots that you choose

591
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:53,640
are preloaded with proteins, those

592
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:56,159
proteins can only do certain reactions.

593
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:01,679
Um, yeah. So I think the potential for

594
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:03,760
abuse in that way is is lower and the

595
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,039
customizability that is inherent in

596
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,480
having this Bluetooth

597
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:12,240
technology would actually potentially

598
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,559
give users the opportunity to make small

599
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
changes that benefit them in the way

600
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,600
that potentially slightly changing the

601
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:24,000
insulin schedule would

602
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,000
without giving undue harm.

603
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,559
Great. Nancy,

604
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,880
thank you. This is fantastic. Um, thank

605
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,880
you for presenting this one. And I say

606
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,120
this as a Sloan graduate student. So,

607
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
back to the business thing. Oh, no. But

608
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,279
as some as someone who like see, you

609
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,279
know, principled uh innovative leaders

610
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
underscore the principled part. So, I I

611
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,799
understand where we're coming from from

612
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,200
like the profit piece, but I can't help

613
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,480
think about how the revenue model could

614
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,159
be different here. I'm curious to get

615
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,640
your thoughts because I think in the US

616
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,520
we have a huge issue with like sick care

617
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,159
instead of healthare. Um and so this to

618
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,400
me when I was like just like reflecting

619
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,000
on the beginning of your presentation

620
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,080
comes across as like could people pay

621
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,720
instead of the subscription piece but

622
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,400
pay for like the benefits that they get

623
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,080
like the healing that they get as a

624
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,240
result of like having a healthier gut.

625
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,679
I'm just curious if like have you

626
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,520
thought about that in terms of you pay

627
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,000
for result as opposed to just like

628
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,320
access on like a monthly cadence which I

629
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,159
agree is a slippery slope and you know

630
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,520
capitalism has all these tentacles and

631
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,600
etc. But like I'm curious to get your

632
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,679
thoughts on if how we could start this

633
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
could also be a way to change the way we

634
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,320
think about healthcare in the US and

635
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,840
beyond. Thank you. Yeah, that's a

636
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,000
fantastic point. Um, and the kind of

637
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,080
subscription idea that I uh offer here

638
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
is just one example of how that could

639
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:50,760
kind of go wrong. I think the um paying

640
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
for results is really a great option.

641
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,400
Um, I do think I think you would kind of

642
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,360
need to have

643
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,039
uh impartial evaluators in place. And I

644
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,480
don't know exactly who that would be. if

645
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,279
it would still be your primary care

646
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,120
physician who then starts you on this

647
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,320
regimen, which I guess is kind of the

648
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,600
case um with uh prescriptions and

649
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,159
treatments nowadays. So, if something

650
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,080
isn't working, you change it.

651
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:21,600
Um but in that, you're not really you're

652
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,559
not really paying for results. Um Oops.

653
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,240
Yikes.

654
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,679
Um, I definitely see that as something

655
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,440
that would

656
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,279
um produce innovation because a company

657
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,880
would

658
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,799
be dedicated to making something that

659
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,200
works better and works faster and works

660
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,880
longer. Um, yeah, the the mechanics I'm

661
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,720
not exactly sure of, but I definitely

662
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,039
think that's a really good uh potential

663
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,039
route to keep

664
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,320
this safe and beneficial for everybody.

665
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,720
Great. So, the last question is from

666
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,480
Amanda. So what is the advantage of

667
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,960
these kind of approach compared to

668
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,360
actually using real bacteria maybe

669
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,880
genetically engineered to actually uh

670
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,840
you know do what they are that just

671
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,880
seems like a a much simpler technology

672
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,080
to to uh deploy than than something like

673
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,559
this uh which uh seems much more

674
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,400
complicated. Yeah. Um great

675
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,640
question.

676
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:22,480
So a lot of us already take probiotics.

677
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,480
If you don't you probably should.

678
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,919
Um,

679
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:32,640
and those definitely really can help.

680
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,039
And if you have a gut microbiome that is

681
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,600
really

682
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:40,480
disregulated, using, you know, eating a

683
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,960
lot of yogurt is not going to fix

684
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,679
everything. We do already have

685
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,600
treatments in place that are a little

686
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,960
more extreme to kind of replace an

687
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,520
unhealthy microbiome and that's

688
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,120
primarily through fecal transplants.

689
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,559
Um

690
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,480
those offer less control and

691
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,080
customization than something like Bbots

692
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,440
would. Um, it

693
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,440
also while you could genetically

694
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,760
engineer these bacteria,

695
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,600
um, I think having the security of the

696
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,679
longevity of something like Bbots and

697
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,080
the understanding that this is exactly

698
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,120
what they're doing, they are producing

699
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,840
just these compounds and responding in

700
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,039
just these ways would make them a lot

701
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,399
uh, easier to implement and would likely

702
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,039
act faster than trying to get uh,

703
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,600
natural bacter to establish a foothold

704
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,600
uh in your body.

705
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,399
Thank you.

706
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,320
Well, um thank you so much, Anelise.

707
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,960
Thank you. So, now it's time for the

708
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,360
judges to sequester in your special

709
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,360
room. Um,
