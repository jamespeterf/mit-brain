00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,880
after a summer of weather extremes where

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,960
does the world stand in its gold to stem

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,000
news the summer of 2023 has been a

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,840
season of weather

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,840
Extremes in June uncontrolled wildfires

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,199
ripped through parts of Canada sending

quality alerts in dozens of downwind

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,600
states in July the world set the hottest

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,840
Global temperature on record which had

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,480
held for 3 days in a row then broke

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,760
again on day four from July into August

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,079
unrelenting heat blanketed large parts

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,800
of Europe Asia and the us while India

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,440
faced a torrential monsoon season and

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,320
heavy rains flooded regions in the

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,280
northeastern us and most recently

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,879
whipped up by high winds in dry

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,080

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,360
through Maui devastating an entire town

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,479
these extreme weather events are mainly

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,400
a consequence of climate change driven

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,320
by humans continued burning of coal oil

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,360
and natural gas climate scientists agree

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,439
that extreme weather such as what people

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,960
experience this summer will likely grow

31
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,320
more frequent and intense in the coming

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,799
years unless something is done on a

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,400
persistent and Planet wide scale to rain

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,560
in global temperatures just how much

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,280
raining in are they talking about the

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,520
number that is internationally agreed

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,320
upon is 1.5° C to prevent worsening and

38
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,320
potentially irreversible effects of

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,200
climate change the world's average

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,119
temperature should not exceed that of

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:50,000
pre-industrial times by more than 1.5° C

42
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,280
2.7 de f as more regions around the

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,479
world face extreme weather it's worth

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,920
taking stock of the 1.5° bar where the

45
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,240
planet stands in relation to this

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,880
threshold and what can be done at the

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,000
global Regional and personal level to

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,039
alive why

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,599
1.5c in 2015 in response to the growing

51
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,280
urgency of climate impacts nearly every

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,080
country in the world signed on to the

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,440
Paris agreement a landmark International

54
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,519
treaty under which 195 Nations pledged

55
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,239
to hold the Earth's temperature to well

56
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,680
below 2° C above pre-industrial levels

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,000
and going further aim to limit the

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,760
temperature increase to 1 1.5° C above

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,599
pre-industrial levels the treaty did not

60
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,720
Define a particular pre-industrial

61
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,720
period though scientists generally

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,120
consider the years from 1850 to 1900 to

63
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,599
be a reliable reference this time

64
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,760
predates humans use of fossil fuels and

65
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,360
is also the earliest period when Global

66
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,519
observations of land and sea

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,920
temperatures are available during this

68
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,640
period the average global temperature

69
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,280
while swinging up and down in certain

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:05,280
years generally hovered around 13.5 C or

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,319
56.3 de F the treaty was informed by a

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,440
fact-f finding report which concluded

73
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,519
that even global warming of 1.5° C above

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,840
the pre-industrial average over an

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,760
extended decades long period would lead

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,920
to high risks for some regions and

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,319
vulnerable

78
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,360
ecosystems the recommendation then was

79
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,480
to set the 1.5° C limit as a defense

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,560
line if the world can keep below this

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,959
line it potentially could avoid the more

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,920
extreme and irrv ible climate effects

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,040
that would occur with a 2° c increase

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,560
and for some places an even smaller

85
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,879
increase than that but as many regions

86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,560
are experiencing today keeping below the

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,200
1.5 line is no guarantee of avoiding

88
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,799
extreme global warming effects there is

89
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,040
nothing magical about the 1.5 number

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,280
other than that is an agreed

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,280
aspirational Target keeping at 1.4 is

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,799
better than 1.5 and 1.3 is better than

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,239
1.4 and so on says Sergey PV deputy

94
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,920
director of mit's joint program on the

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,519
science and policy of global change the

96
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,159
science does not tell us that if for

97
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,640
example the temperature increase is 1.51

98
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,799
De C then it would definitely be the end

99
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,840
of the world similarly if the

100
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,440
temperature would stay at 1.49 De

101
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,959
increase it does not mean that we will

102
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,079
eliminate all impacts of climate change

103
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,040
what is known the lower the target for

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
an increase in temperature the lower the

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,720
risk of climate

106
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,960
impacts how close are we to

107
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,479
1.5c in 2022 the average global

108
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,039
temperature was about 1.15 de C above

109
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:41,560
pre-industrial levels according to the

110
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:43,880
World Meteorological organization wo the

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,800
cyclical weather phenomenon lenia

112
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,440
recently contributed to temporarily

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,919
Cooling and dampening the effects of

114
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,960
human induced climate change lenia

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,680
lasted for 3 years and ended around

116
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,320
March of 2023 in May the wo issued a

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,240
report that projected a significant

118
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,360
likelihood 66% that the world would

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,039
exceed the 1.5° C threshold in the next

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,280
4 years this breach would likely be

121
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,680
driven by human induced climate change

122
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,320
combined with a warming El Nino a

123
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,560
cyclical weather phenomenon that

124
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,880
temporarily heats up ocean regions and

125
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,639
pushes global temperatures higher this

126
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,479
summer an El Nino is currently underway

127
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,120
and the event typically raises global

128
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,240
temperatures in the year after it sets

129
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,600
in which in this case would be in 2024

130
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,680
the wmo predicts that for each of the

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,759
next four years the global average

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,080
temperature is likely to swing between

133
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,240
1.1 and 1.8 de C above pre-industrial

134
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,520
levels though there's a good chance the

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,080
world will get hotter than the 1.5 Dee

136
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,479
limit as a result of El Nino the breach

137
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,520
would be temporary and for now would not

138
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
have failed the Paris agreement which

139
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,560
aims to keep global temperatures below

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,440
the 1.5° limit over the long term

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,479
averaged over several decades rather

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,800
than a single year but we should not

143
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,800
forget that this is a global average and

144
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,960
there are variations regionally and

145
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,199
seasonally says alphat elah here the HM

of civil and environmental engineering

148
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,599
at MIT this year we had extreme

149
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,160
conditions around the world even though

150
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,039
we haven't reached the 1.5c threshold so

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,160
even if we control the average at a

152
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,840
global magnitude we are going to see

153
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,960
events that are extreme because of

154
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,080
climate

155
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,639
change more than a

156

number to hold the planet's long-term

157
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,280
average temperature to below the 1.5°

158
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,120
threshold the world will have to reach

net zero emissions by the year 2050

160
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,400
according to the intergovernmental panel

161
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,160
on climate change ipcc this means that

162
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,919
in terms of the emissions released by

163
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,120
the burning of coal oil and natural gas

164
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
the entire world will have to remove as

165
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,400
much as it puts into the atmosphere in

166
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,520

170
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,120
the task of curbing emissions in time is

171
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,720
particularly daunting for the United

172
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,440
States which is second only to China in

173
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,080
generating the most carbon dioxide

174
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,720
emissions in the world the US's burning

175
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,800
of fossil fuels and consumption of

176
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,560
energy is just way above the rest of the

177
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,919
world that's a persistent problem Ela

178
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,599
here says and the national statistics

179
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,199
are an aggregate of what a lot of

180
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,960
individuals are doing at an individual

181
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,720
level there are things that can be done

182
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,240
to help bring down one's personal

183
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,520
emissions and potentially chip away at

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
Rising global temperatures we are

185
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,000
consumers of products that either embody

186
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,560
greenhouse gases such as meat clothes

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,280
computers and homes or we are directly

188
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,199
responsible for emitting greenhouse

189
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,319
gases such as when we use Cars airplanes

190
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:49,360
electricity and air conditioners PV says

191
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,800
our everyday choices affect the amount

192
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
of emissions that are added to the

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,240
atmosphere but to compel people to

194
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,960
change their emissions it may be less

195
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,840
about a number and more about a feeling

196
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,639
to get people to act my hypothesis is

197
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,479
you need to reach them not just by

198
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,080
convincing them to be good citizens and

199
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,159
saying it's good for the world to keep

200
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,919
below

201
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:12,520
1.5° but showing how they individually

202
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,360
will be impacted says Ela here who

203
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,479
specializes on the study of regional

204
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,120
climates focusing on how climate change

205
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,960
impacts the water cycle and frequency of

206
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,159
extreme weather such as heat waves true

207
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,120
climate progress requires a dramatic

208
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,680
change in how the human system gets its

209
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,240
energy Pelt says it is a huge

210
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,360
undertaking are you ready personally to

211
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,519
make sacrifices and to change the way of

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,560
your life if one gets an honest answer

213
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,680
to that question it would help to

214
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,640
understand why true climate progress is

215
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,640
so difficult to achieve
