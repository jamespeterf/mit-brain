1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
The farthest human beings have ever

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
traveled away from the earth was during

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,160
the Apollo flights to the moon from 1969

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
through 1972. [music]

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,679
I like to do an experiment with my

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,519
students to give them an idea of what

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
was really involved in leaving the

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,685
Earth. And you can see that this moon is

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,520
about the right size for this scale.

10
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,680
[music] The challenge is for them to

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,199
position themselves so that the Earth

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,240
and the Moon are the right distance

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,039
apart. And the results can sometimes be

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,000
amusing. The moon is about a quarter of

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,160
a million miles away, roughly 400,000

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,440
km. [music] And the circumference of the

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,879
Earth is about 25,000 miles or about

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,600
40,000 km. [music] So the distance to

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,200
the moon is about 10 times the

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
circumference of the Earth. [music] You

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,200
get the point. The moon is pretty far

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,600
away. Big hand for our demonstrators

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,520
here. [applause]
