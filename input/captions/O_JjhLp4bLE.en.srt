1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,160
All right. Well, my name is Tony. I'm

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,240
the CEO and co-founder of Stack Aai. I

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,880
did my PhD here at MIT together with my

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,720
co-founder. And Stackai is building AI

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,199
agents for the enterprise. We are having

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,240
an approach that basically connects very

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,519
much data with LLM with SAS platforms.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,680
The way we do it is um with a platform

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,519
that is basically encapsulating

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,199
everything as nodes that you can connect

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,079
together. The nodes that we have are

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,040
from the most common databases and where

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,480
uh uh content management systems that

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,960
you have in enterprise. It goes from

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
SharePoint, Salesforce, Snowflake to the

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,040
different LM providers that you have

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,960
there. OpenAI, Coher, Anthropic and so

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,399
on. The idea is very much that you can

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
drag and drop nodes and connect them

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,760
with a visual editor that you can see

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,120
here. It's very small but hopefully you

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,039
can see that there are nodes that you

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,280
can connect. Once you have this back end

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
which by the way is LLM agnostic,

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
knowledge base agnostic and SAS tool

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
agnostic. You can deploy it with

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,960
different interfaces. We connect with

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
all your communication channels. It can

29
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,400
go from email, Slack, teams. Um it can

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
be from messaging systems but also end

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,040
to end interfaces. This means with UI

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,799
and UX included. Chat GPT interface is a

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
very common one but also form interfaces

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
with fixed inputs and fixed outputs.

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,159
badge interfaces that looks like

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,000
spreadsheets and of course API endpoints

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
that you can call uh your IT department

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
can connect to very easily. The idea is

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,360
that once you deploy this platform and

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
these AI agents it can go from mostly

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
back office automation uh from IT

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,600
support desk to other kind of tasks that

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
are repetitive or those that are not

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
that repetitive but that have like some

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
level of reasoning and then you feel

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,400
confident they can uh you could auto

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
automate. Once you deploy that, you have

48
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,560
an analytics dashboard where you can

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,960
monitor all the runs, users, tokens

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
used, errors, and so on. It's a very

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
visual interface so that even CIOS can

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
plug in, see what's happening, what are

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,079
the AI agents that you're deploying.

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,520
We're working with very big companies

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,360
that are deploying many of those and

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,320
observability, predictability, rolebased

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,560
access control is critical for them. Uh

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,800
we are so two type two compliant, HIPPA

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,399
compliant for all our teleaalth medicine

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
uh customers that we have. We have

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,720
public uh companies in the tele health

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,440
space as well and GDPR for all our

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,879
customers in uh Europe. We uh also offer

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
on premise deployments. We have a

65
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,560
defense company for example that needed

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,319
everything in their on premise and I'm

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,760
not even talking about Azure kind of

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,680
deployments. I'm talking about raw

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,560
servers but we also do virtual private

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
cloud Azure AWS GCP you name it. We've

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,879
done deployments across the world even

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,959
in Australia. Um we operate across the

73
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,879
world as I was saying US, Canada and uh

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,840
Europe are the main customers but also

75
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,080
Asia Pacific, Japan and so on. Uh in

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,000
terms of uh industries we're a very

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,560
horizontal platform where we focus on uh

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,239
healthcare companies, finance and also

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
logistics though we are working with

80
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,120
defense companies, public sector,

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
Massachusetts government is also

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
interested in our platform and so on.

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,000
MIT is actually a big customers of ours.

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,959
We have 3,500 users here. So very proud

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,599
partners and um in terms of like use

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,159
cases uh I'll just touch on some of

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,480
these but Freya is one that I love

88
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,040
because they were uh operating in Europe

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,720
and they had uh lots of logistics kind

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,720
of like operations there and they have

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,560
to handle a lot of languages Nordic

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
languages mostly Norian Swedish and so

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
on and the idea that they could do

94
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,879
everything in Stati without using all

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,560
the third party software was very

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,920
enticing to them also they've deployed a

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,120
lot of use cases right now they have

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,200
more mostly on the support desk IT side

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,360
of things and uh since then I mean

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,159
they've automated uh many things that

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,000
are from operations to uh business to

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
even marketing and SEO optimization of

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,159
the website like there's lots of use

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,879
cases that can be applied with stack

105
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,200
we're also working with uh live MD

106
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,799
public healthcare company uh in the tele

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
health side of things what they mostly

108
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
do is like conversations patients to

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,080
doctors and what they've done is like a

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,560
copilot that helps doctors interact with

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,280
the patients without having to change uh

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
tabs and and and windows. So basically

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,799
they have the conversation with the

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,959
patient and the right information about

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,599
the patient is displayed right next to

116
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,599
their conversation. The we're also

117
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,680
working these are anonymized use cases.

118
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
Unfortunately I cannot share uh push the

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040
customer but basically one of the

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
biggest digital banks in the world. They

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,560
have 100 million customers right now and

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,759
they've automated risk and compliance

123
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,840
via copilos that they deploy in Slack.

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,680
And then we have one of the top 10 civil

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
engineering firms in the US that are

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
building billions of dollars for bridges

127
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,919
and stadiums and things like that. And

128
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,440
they've indexed 7,000 of the employ the

129
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,759
CVS of the employees that they have

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
internally. And now they are managing to

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,440
connect these employees to the right

132
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,479
RFPs, the requests for proposals or

133
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,360
projects um to automate this whole uh

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,160
process of creating these uh

135
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,680
documentation. And with that they are

136
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
able to apply to projects much faster

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,479
than their competition. Something that

138
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
they were before doing by calling the

139
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,840
Ohio office. Hey, who do you know that

140
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,360
is an expert in glass ceilings for

141
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,120
stadiums? Now they do it

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,960
conversationally uh much faster with our

143
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,720
platform partnership asking for

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,280
distribution partners. Now we're talking

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
with big uh consulting firms that are

146
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
happy to partner with us to distribute

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
this uh platform but also on boarding

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,560
new customers in different industries,

149
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
regulated industries that deal with a

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
lot of unstructured data are our you

151
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,639
know bread and butter of sorts. So if

152
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,320
you are one of those, let me know and uh

153
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,720
feel free to reach out directly to my

154
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,120
email or the

155
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,120
enterprise.com. Thank you so much.

156
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
Thanks Claus. How do you compare your

157
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
solution to hyperscaler solutions like

158
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,880
agent space or copilot? Very good

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
question. Um one customer put it really

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,600
well. Copilot studio feels like internet

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,560
explorer versus Google Chrome. So your

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,720
choice to select one or the other. Um

163
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,800
but it's much much easier, much faster.

164
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,280
Um you you'll see the value in minutes

165
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,280
instead of days.

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,440
Um and how long are your sales cycles

167
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,800
considering everything that you said? So

168
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,479
for example, the the civil engineering

169
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,639
firm, it took two weeks. It's kind of

170
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,440
funny because the CIO saw a video about

171
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,680
us and and and he was like, "Hey, I like

172
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
this." And he skipped through the whole

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,039
process. He was the CIO also, so he

174
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,960
could skip a lot and we went straight to

175
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,960
that. But for example for life MD it

176
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,720
took three months through procurement

177
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,160
compliance. There's also like all the

178
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,560
red lining for the contracts and stuff

179
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,000
like that. So it can take uh longer than

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
that of course like the defense company

181
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,759
I was telling you about took about six

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,880
months and that was the most complicated

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,880
one I would say. Thank you.
