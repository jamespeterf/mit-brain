created over 8 years ago to support MIT

00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,160
connected startups as they grow expand

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,399
and help solve some of the world's

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,440
greatest challenges by fostering

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,359
Partnerships and collaborations with

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,280
industry and primarily ILP members

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,280

and

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,439
Beyond these startups in our program are

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,720
based on MIT licensed technology or

29
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,439
founded by MIT faculty staff or alumni

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,159
and they can also be vetted by some of

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,320
our MIT peers including the engine

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,280

entrepreneurship just to name a few

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,759
and so our program our Network um has

36
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,119
around a thousand startups and they

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,640

startups and I've highlighted in bold

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,560
those represented by those that will

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,079

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,240
AI and machine learning also big data

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,920
and analytics sustainability renewable

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,360
energy energy storage and lifestyle

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,119
science and

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,840
healthare so as far as

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,000
value um when it comes to that um the

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,360
startups in our program have exposure to

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,080
a Global Network of Industry decision

52
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,200
makers and the corporates have access to

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,840
vetted MIT connected

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,239
startups also events is a critical

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,200
component of this we host over 30 per

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,360
year locally and internationally

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,400
including demo days like today

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,160
conferences where startups have um

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,360
participation in lightning talks and

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,319
Exhibits also workshops trainings

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,920
one-on-one meetings and so much more the

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,720
benefit of this for the ILP members is

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,480
that we can tailor an event according to

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,080
your needs and the benefit to the

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,879
startups is that we can take you to

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,360
other markets that you're expanding into

67
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,840
and you can have visibility into new

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,560
ecosystems we also launch calls for

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
startups these are what we call

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
opportunities and they're based on

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
corporates priorities and intern

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
internal challenges and so startups can

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,599
apply on our website and if they are

74
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,080
selected they can work with an ILP

75
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,480
member to help you solve a problem or

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,959
challenge that you're facing in your

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,440
industry so all in all um we have a very

78
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,280
curated um and customized approach and I

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,720
hope everyone is uh being able to take

80
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,720

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,879
