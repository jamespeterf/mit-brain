9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,600
>> Before we move on to the rest of the

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,880
topics, uh maybe just a some

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,720
administrative stuff about the next

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,520
assignment. Uh so the idea is to model a

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,760
system right? Uh so the idea is to pick

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,079
some sort of the old system. Um

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
in the past people have picked stuff

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,680
like applying for college because they

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
knew all about that. Uh they you know

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,200
people have talked about uh an example I

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,879
give is you know running a nuclear

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,680
reactor or something. That's basically

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,760
there's a there's a uh but hey, you

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,760
know, if if any of you are new to

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,559
science majors, you know,

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,720
>> Oh, perfect. Okay. All right. Well, one

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,799
of one of my favorite 2 games was was

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,520
actually uh nuclear reactor simulation.

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,920
It always melted down. That's why it was

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,640
fun. Awesome. Um but yeah, you know,

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,280
pick pick a real world system to model

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,560
um to start uh modeling. Obviously,

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
you're trying to find a fun. Obviously,

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,479
you're trying to make something that

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,479
people are going to enjoy playing. Uh uh

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,479
but the the idea is to start from a

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,600
slightly different place from where we

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,119
had uh uh um in the first assignment.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,040
Now, a couple of you guys already did

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,640
that for the first assignment though. I

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
mean, things like picking up girls at a

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
party. I mean, you're modeling real

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,799
system in a sense. Uh still haven't

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,240
played the genealogy game yet. So So, so

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
we're going to play that tomorrow. So,

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,600
so

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,759
we'll see that. Um the the survival

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,880
horror game I would say is not a real

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,240
world system.

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
>> It was a system.

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
>> Tasers.

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,040
>> Yeah. Or wizards enemies.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,800
>> But uh so so yeah, pick pick something.

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:13,760
Um uh we've seen games um uh negotiating

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,080
around like negotiating uh greenhouse

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,400
gas emissions. There was there was one

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,319
uh which was really really cutthroat as

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
you'll probably imagine.

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,640
>> Yeah.

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
>> Um actually I'll try to I'll try to get

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
the team to come in late in the semester

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,560
to talk about the card game. Uh this was

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,480
a freshman team on Periscope.

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,920
Um let's see. Uh you on Wednesday we're

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
going to do the usual brainstorming

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,360
exercise in the second half of the of

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,640
the class. You know everybody throw out

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
your ideas come in with a bunch of

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,440
ideas. We'll try to build on that. Um

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,680
but uh this time around you're allowed

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,760
to actually pre-build your team. You

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
you're allowed to to to ask people, you

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,080
know, hey, you guys want to work

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,599
together? Um you don't actually have to

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
like figure it out on the spot if you

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,440
don't want to. Um I don't really care

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
how you do it as long as by Friday you

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,640
know who your team is. Um and and who's

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,400
on team sizes are are the same.

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,879
So

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,360
any questions? Are we able to simulate

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,680
things that aren't from like this era?

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,000
>> Yeah.

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,440
>> Okay.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
>> Like like from history?

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
>> Yeah.

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
>> Okay. Not from like the future.

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,760
>> Oh,

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,760
>> no.

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,879
Future.

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,480
>> Yeah. Yeah. Sure. It's like this is how

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,560
things are going to work.

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,959
>> Well, well, I mean I mean Okay. So, so

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,239
yes. Yes. Absolutely. Historical stuff.

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,280
Uh um and but you do have some

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,280
liberties. Uh I'm not saying that your

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,239
game has to be a faithful simulation. Am

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,560
I getting a little bit more into

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,560
simulation? say um but it doesn't have

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,640
to be a faithful simulation necessarily

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
of what you're talking but you know in a

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,000
sense you're trying to like capture the

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,920
spirit of it um you know if if if the

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,680
point is I'm running a nuclear reactor

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
and you can sort of capture the oh my

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,040
god it's so dangerous or the oh my god

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,239
it's so boring aspect of it uh have you

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,319
actually worked on nuclear reactor

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,319
>> well there

108
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,879
>> and I know like the mechanics of it but

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,319
I think there I I've been told it's not

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,239
necessarily the most exciting job in the

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
No. Yeah, you just sit there and do your

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,400
homework and every once in a while you

113
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,959
look up

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,880
very reasonable

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
>> and they get paid for like I know 12 or

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
13 bucks an hour or something.

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
>> Yeah. So, so you know if the whole idea

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,520
of the game is let's try try try to get

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,800
as much homework done without

120
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
>> that might be more entertaining than

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,919
just like

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
>> cool

123
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,360
critical

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,000
>> um

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,479
but I got my problems then

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,080
>> just plus one points you have to do

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,600
homework while you play

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,199
>> Wow

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
Terrible be the worst game Whatever.

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,720
What happens if you

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,960
>> guys

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
may be too meta at that point?

133
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
>> And besides, but I think we still have a

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
time limit like half an hour or

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
something like that. You know, it's like

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,479
homework.

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,479
>> We have really easy homework.

138
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,080
>> Um, let's see. Just a reminder for

139
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
everyone who hasn't uh who's been

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
falling off on the forum post, please

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
make sure that you keep up on your forum

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,280
post. Those things actually do affect

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,000
your grade. Uh so um again we're

144
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,160
expecting one in person not one team. Uh

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,240
so if you have any uh opinions since

146
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
we're in between reading uh assignments

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
right right now you can write about the

148
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,360
assignment but if you wrote up something

149
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
let's say a reflection on how the past

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,880
assignment went. You know that that's

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,960
fine. We're not expecting more than one

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,320
forum post a week. Of course, feel free

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
to comment on other people's forum posts

154
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,759
as well. And those if you want to like

155
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,039
if you if there's a discussion or a

156
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
point that's been raised that's kind of

157
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,080
interesting and you want to kind of

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
develop on that, you know, put some

159
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,720
thought into it. Write something

160
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,280
interesting that's going to keep on the

161
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,720
conversation that that counts too. Um

162
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,720
and and that's fine.

163
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay. So, puddles. Um

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,840
so, Brenda's Okay. So actually before I

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
start the renders, let's let's start

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,720
with Scott's Scott. What what what were

167
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,639
some of the definitions or some of the

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,360
things that Scott King was mentioning

169
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:18,000
that were good for puzzle design?

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,840
>> I was reading

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
>> that was in the book or not in the book.

172
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,199
>> Uh this was the the the web page

173
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
>> web page

174
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
difficulty

175
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
>> fun and has the right answer.

176
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,280
>> Yeah,

177
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,880
>> that's actually a solution. Yeah. could

178
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,160
actually create.

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,759
>> He he he he didn't really differentiate

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
between like kind of like puzzles that

181
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,120
could be generated uh you know like a

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,880
sudoku or something where you have you

183
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,600
kind of have an algorithm that lets you

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,840
create multiple puzzles and but as long

185
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,000
as that that particular iteration had

186
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,840
right answer. Uh so that was really

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,440
fair. Um anything else you remember

188
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,160
talked a lot about difficulty.

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
>> Mhm. make it accessible but not super

190
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,759
easy,

191
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,319
>> right?

192
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,120
>> And targeting a specific audience.

193
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,120
>> There's also the ability to uh change

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,800
the difficulty. Was it dynamic

195
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,280
difficulty?

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,280
>> Uh so some areas may actually be easier

197
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,199
easier settings and then actually what

198
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,639
they want it to be in harder settings.

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,080
>> I think that was Brenda's but yeah.

200
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,000
There's there's also the distinction

201
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,000
between sort of like type of difficulty

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
like you know things where

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,520
>> you know the letter puzzle that he has

204
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,280
at the beginning where it requires

205
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
>> sort of like thinking about it figuring

206
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,120
out how

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,440
>> yeah it's it's it was patience versus

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
something else I can remember

209
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,919
>> but then you have things like mazes

210
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,880
where it's all patience where you have

211
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,560
to like be very like careful and and

212
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,919
your way through

213
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,479
>> and sometimes they're like bringing in

214
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,319
information from from other domains from

215
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,680
outside from outside of the console it's

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,720
just like all the information that is

217
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,639
currently in the puzzle. Um

218
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,639
uh but but the interesting thing about

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,360
the puzzle that he particularly shows is

220
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,360
that he shows a range of different ways

221
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
to actually solve it. None of which are

222
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,440
actually satisfying except for that

223
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,440
final answer which which he irritatedly

224
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,440
does not tell you like gives you another

225
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,440
puzzle.

226
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,960
Um but um you know it's kind of

227
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
interesting to think about actually

228
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,479
what's the audience for those kinds of

229
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
specific puzzles. I mean there there are

230
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,199
magazines out there like games magazine

231
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,160
in particular but um sometimes you see

232
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,840
um stuff nestled into magazines um uh

233
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,039
that are not just about games. you see

234
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,279
stuff like cross word puzzles and

235
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,519
newspapers and everything like that and

236
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,719
now things like Sudoku and all that are

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,320
becoming way more popular um that are

238
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,720
you know that are meant to be really

239
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,640
really mass audience whereas a magazine

240
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,640
that is specifically targeted at puzzle

241
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,240
enthusiasts can be like super hardcore

242
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,760
but of course if the whole magazine then

243
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
you can have like a whole range of

244
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,760
different difficulties in there you know

245
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
the the assumption that you can solve

246
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,920
something not so

247
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,600
>> out of interest does anybody know like

248
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,440
really actually know how people in

249
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,519
newspapers generate cross word puzzles

250
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,360
and pseudo puzzles? Like does anybody

251
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,800
know what the actual process behind that

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,839
is? Cuz I don't know, right?

253
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,519
>> I think

254
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,800
>> I mean I imagine how you might do it.

255
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,800
You might start with the filled out

256
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,160
thing and then like remove bits to get

257
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,040
your sudoku

258
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,880
>> or you might brute force dictionary

259
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,399
search to come up with words which fit

260
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,320
together in order for

261
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,800
>> what they do with sudoku now is they

262
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,000
have some like computer algorithm to and

263
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:37,120
has scales difficulty and it generates a

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,240
random sudoku puzzle from your input

265
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
powerful

266
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,200
>> sudoku is solved enough that you can

267
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
actually just algorithmically generate

268
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,120
for like

269
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,800
>> a an actual ual, you know, numerical

270
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
difficulty.

271
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,200
>> You scale it from, you know, like 1 to

272
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
10. 10 being where

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,080
>> where there's like literally only one

274
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,920
step to take at each point.

275
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,839
>> Oh, the one the one that takes three

276
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,279
months that took him three months to

277
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,440
solve or something.

278
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
>> But but like cross there's there's

279
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
people actually just get paid to sit

280
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,640
down and generate those.

281
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,640
>> Will shorts

282
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
times takes submissions from other

283
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,560
people. That's why it says edited by

284
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
Will Schwarz because people submit stuff

285
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,480
and then he kind of like just touches it

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
up.

287
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
>> So he he kind of crowdsources cross word

288
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
puzzle

289
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,079
>> generation. I'm sure I'm sure

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,560
>> in the past you had to created it own.

291
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,200
>> Yeah.

292
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
>> But I mean so the difficulty in a cross

293
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,040
word puzzle isn't just like in the sort

294
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,680
of geometric layout of how the words the

295
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,120
words go is the the specific clues that

296
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
they give you can be more or less

297
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,680
obuscated in some ways. And New York

298
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,800
Times in particular with this is, you

299
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,040
know, they they'll give you like two

300
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
words that don't that that with with no

301
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
grammatical context about how that's

302
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,600
supposed to fit in.

303
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,760
>> Well, it gets harder during the week.

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,240
So,

305
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,279
>> yeah.

306
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,040
>> Yeah. So, so so and and and so you you

307
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,560
you can actually compare and see how

308
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
that difficulty scaling is just by

309
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,000
looking at the clues, not even looking

310
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,480
at the puzzle itself. Um and of course

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
the other thing about crosswords is uh

312
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,920
you know just just to bring up a point

313
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,320
that we talked about in earlier class

314
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,760
you know it's that the cross words that

315
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,360
we're familiar with at least are

316
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,120
dependent on the redundancy of the

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,839
English language right you know there

318
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,839
you don't need every single letter in a

319
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,279
in of a word in order to figure out what

320
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
that word is so that if there's a word

321
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
that you couldn't otherwise have gotten

322
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
from the clue you can still get it just

323
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,839
by seeing the letters that are available

324
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,560
that's because English language is kind

325
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,640
of about 50% redundant information. If

326
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,079
you dropped every single vowel in in in

327
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,959
in a sentence, you could probably still

328
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,760
make out what that sentence said. And

329
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,640
you don't necessarily get that with

330
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Chinese, for instance.

331
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,120
How many folks here have like some or

332
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,959
there probably are other languages here

333
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
where like every single character can

334
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
mean means a word or something like

335
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,920
that?

336
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,959
>> Hebrew has no vows, right?

337
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,880
>> Well, they do like third grade and they

338
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,880
start dropping them after that. So it's

339
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,800
basically because it is understandable

340
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,440
without vowels, you eventually just stop

341
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
using them.

342
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,240
>> Oh yeah. So that's interesting. If you

343
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,600
had a cross word in Hebrew that where

344
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,160
you expected to write in the words with

345
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,720
vowels, you probably could actually uh

346
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,959
do it one very similar to to an English

347
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
one.

348
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,079
>> It's difficult because the vowels in

349
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,480
Hebrew are attached to a letter, not a

350
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,000
separate character.

351
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,000
>> Below letters or barow.

352
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
>> No.

353
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
But you wonder if in the in a cross word

354
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
in a letter can make a different sound

355
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
with both.

356
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,160
>> Mhm.

357
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,440
>> Soft C or hard C

358
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,000
>> because a V can be vo or va or they you

359
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,880
don't know. You only know by context.

360
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
>> English like C could be a hard soft

361
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,000
>> or G could be J.

362
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
>> Yeah.

363
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,040
>> Yeah. It's true. that although in

364
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,639
English in particular the phonetic

365
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,480
meaning

366
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,200
the the way how a certain word is

367
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,880
pronounced isn't necessarily uh isn't

368
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,480
necessarily essential for solving a

369
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,440
puzzle puzzle unless the clues happen to

370
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,279
be phonetic clues you know sounds like a

371
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,920
fish uh so so so

372
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,560
that may not come in so much play when

373
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,720
it comes to English in particular

374
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,839
>> um Jason you had your hand up earlier

375
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,040
about

376
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,320
>> it There's going to be count

377
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,920
algorithmically generated.

378
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,160
>> Well, also one thing about algorithmic

379
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,760
about Sudoku difficulty, a lot of it

380
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,839
comes on the selective removal of

381
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,600
numbers. It's not what is the final

382
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,600
number, the final pattern going to look

383
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,519
like. That's actually the difficulty.

384
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,120
It's how do we remove the numbers in a

385
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,920
way that gives multiple possible answers

386
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,079
uh or multiple possible dead ends uh

387
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,399
because really there's only one solution

388
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,000
at the end of it. Um I'm not actually

389
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,360
familiar with the algorithm which does

390
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,560
so but it seems to be very clear that

391
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
there are at least two algorithms. One

392
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,040
of which is very easy which is just

393
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,959
provide a a legitimate pseudogu solution

394
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,560
and then one slightly harder is which

395
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,600
now which numbers to be removed so that

396
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,600
it's still solvable.

397
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,440
Um can people take picross? Um yeah,

398
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
>> some someone want to describe it for the

399
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,480
folks who haven't aren't familiar with

400
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,199
with with it. We can use the whiteboard.

401
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
>> Sure.

402
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:23,839
>> Um I think on the

403
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,399
>> I think the green one works better.

404
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,480
>> Yeah, I remember read

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,480
only familiar across 3D.

406
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, that's the best way.

407
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,000
>> Sorry to put you on the spot.

408
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
>> The idea is that you'll have words and

409
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,639
poems

410
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:54,360
>> and then they'll have some number.

411
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,360
>> Oh, this

412
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,839
>> this one you fill in the blocks.

413
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,240
>> Okay. And then and then given this

414
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,720
information we have to work out which of

415
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,760
these blocks is filled and which can be

416
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,880
removed.

417
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,519
>> And the idea is that

418
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
>> the numbers

419
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,240
>> the number tells you the number of

420
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,600
blocks in that row or column which has a

421
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
filled block in it.

422
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
>> So it's like

423
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,639
>> so in this case like

424
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,360
>> they're also given

425
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,600
>> nothing in this column

426
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,320
this column and that column can have

427
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,639
anything in it. Um and this is probably

428
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,440
not actually example because it's

429
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
probably the numbers are

430
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,839
>> the subs are not the same.

431
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,360
>> But yeah,

432
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,079
>> so

433
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
you get the idea.

434
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,720
>> It's not going to work, but you get the

435
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,560
idea. And then things can get more

436
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
complicated. So the

437
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,000
>> additionally, if there's just I think a

438
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,920
three, then it means that there's a

439
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,800
connected block of three. So for

440
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,920
instance, this that and that might all

441
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,079
have to be. Um, but if there's a three,

442
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,279
which I think is in like a square or

443
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,839
something along these lines, that means

444
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,600
that there are three in that column, but

445
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,839
there's a gap in there somewhere. And

446
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,079
then if it's like a three in a circle or

447
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
something else complicated like that,

448
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,639
then it means that there are three, but

449
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,880
they all have gaps between

450
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
where they have a list of numbers and

451
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,160
those are the

452
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
>> there are consecutive blocks of that

453
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,399
length. Yeah.

454
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,800
>> So, so, so, so for one column you might

455
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,880
say like 2 three five which means there

456
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,320
is a block of two followed by a block of

457
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,680
three followed by a block of five

458
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120
>> and they have to have a gap between them

459
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
>> and they will have a gap in between

460
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
them. So, it's not like if there's

461
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,560
actually a block of eight in there

462
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,480
somewhere.

463
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,880
>> But but that's the but the whole idea is

464
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
that you know you've got this um

465
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,079
information that that is actually

466
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,920
redundant. you know, you've got more

467
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,360
information in there than you

468
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,040
necessarily need to be able to figure

469
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,959
out which blocks in the solution should

470
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,600
be filled and when it should be empty,

471
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,079
but you know, it's presented to you in

472
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,759
this opuscated way. The the evidence the

473
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,759
the clues that are given to you in a way

474
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,600
that you know that requires you to

475
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,120
perform these algorithms in order to

476
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
figure out which one is created and

477
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,240
usually that's an algorithm that you can

478
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,519
use yourself. Uh although you know like

479
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,679
um I think Kim was the one who was

480
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,760
talking about pattern matching although

481
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
was

482
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,360
uh but you know eventually as you get

483
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,640
good at these things you start to you

484
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,120
you start to recognize patterns right

485
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,959
off the bat right like that's a zero oh

486
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,480
wow okay so that entire row is empty

487
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,720
that that that's that's that's the sort

488
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,760
of thing that you that becomes automatic

489
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,760
after you you you

490
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,679
>> um so let's see I'm not sure if I much

491
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,600
more to talk about Scott Kim, but you

492
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:40,080
know these are these are more like

493
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,720
generated stuff. Tip over has

494
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,120
so this is this basically is um it's

495
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,880
along the lines of what uh Scott Pin uh

496
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,280
is talking about, but obviously this is

497
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,679
more physical, not a pen and paper kind

498
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
of thing.

499
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,120
>> Can you move for the coffee yet?

500
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,640
>> Oh, move the coffee.

501
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,480
>> No, I just want you to look at this.

502
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
>> Okay, good.

503
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,960
Look at this first. Don't look at that.

504
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Uh don't look at that. Um so the basic

505
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,440
idea is let me just start with one. Um

506
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,000
you get a card that's actually a a

507
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,080
puzzle. Um I wish we were doing this

508
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,480
outside now because I could have zoomed

509
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,919
this out. Um but the puzzle basically

510
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,720
just tells you how you're supposed to

511
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,600
set up your board initially. So there's

512
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,679
a Oops, wrong.

513
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,760
There's a green guy there. There's a

514
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
green guy there. This is supposed to be

515
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,960
an easy puzzle. I hope it is because I'm

516
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,960
really bad at this.

517
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,039
Red guy goes there, I think. Yeah. And

518
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,640
that's the puzzle.

519
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,799
And then and there's one with a little

520
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,080
square on it and then you have this

521
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,600
chat. What?

522
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,000
>> That's cool.

523
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,919
>> That's awesome. So the basic idea is you

524
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,559
tip over the pieces so that um so that

525
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,559
the guy moves um and you don't want to

526
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,320
be tipping over the pieces in a way

527
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,280
where uh the um where the guy can't move

528
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,280
anymore.

529
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
>> Um

530
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,799
>> yeah. So you're you're tipping over

531
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
things to make a path that he can walk

532
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,679
along, right?

533
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,640
>> Yeah.

534
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,160
>> And then make a closed loop

535
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
>> and he has to touch every piece.

536
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,679
>> I think he just has to get to this one

537
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
get to the red one. Um,

538
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,919
>> there's a plus mark.

539
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
>> So, knock it that way and then green

540
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
this way.

541
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,320
>> Yeah. Yes, I agree.

542
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,679
>> Yeah. I'm not exactly sure how to solve

543
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,200
this one.

544
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
>> So, yellow that way, green.

545
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
>> Yeah.

546
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,440
>> Yellow that way.

547
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,520
>> Yeah.

548
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
>> Wait, you're allowed to tip him over?

549
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
>> Yeah.

550
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
>> Did he die?

551
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,080
>> My understanding is that he needs to

552
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,919
fall onto another piece actually.

553
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
>> Oh, so let let me just confirm I set

554
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,679
this up right actually. Yeah, I did.

555
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,799
>> No. So, you push the yellow that way and

556
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
then the green that way and the other

557
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
green that way.

558
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,360
So with the yellow one goes.

559
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,039
>> So do the green ones first.

560
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,840
>> Yeah. I don't understand the rules for

561
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,480
yellow.

562
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,799
>> Exactly. And then

563
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
>> there.

564
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,360
>> No, it doesn't.

565
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,600
>> Yeah. I I

566
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,600
>> How does he

567
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,960
Yeah, he he's he's actually allowed to

568
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,600
move on anything that that's

569
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,240
continuously connected. So as long as

570
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,200
you can continuously

571
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,720
connect up to this, you're fine. So tip

572
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,960
tip the second green over.

573
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,520
>> So tip that first green.

574
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,280
>> No other way.

575
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,559
>> Yeah.

576
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,880
>> Doesn't that wrong path right now? If

577
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,880
you tip that.

578
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,679
>> Are you sure tipping over means move on

579
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
spot or not?

580
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,360
>> Well, if it doesn't then you can't reach

581
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
the red effort. Yeah, I am absolutely

582
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,640
sure it means that you're supposed to

583
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,440
tip it over in a way that might be a

584
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,600
>> screw. Tip the yellow over first and

585
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,280
move the move the guy onto the green,

586
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,120
then tip over the green.

587
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,960
>> Oh, right.

588
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,480
>> You think you are? I think you are.

589
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,600
>> What? Why?

590
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
>> That was crazy.

591
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,520
>> That was why That is why it's supposed

592
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,679
to be a beginner puzzle. You can

593
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,919
actually do it. You can actually do it.

594
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,840
This is This is why this is puzzle one.

595
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,400
>> Uh you don't have to fall on top of

596
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,200
anything.

597
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
>> It's bizarre.

598
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
>> Yeah. Like the instinct is you know you

599
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,720
want to build a path that you can walk

600
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,159
makes no sense.

601
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,640
>> Yeah.

602
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,799
>> The guy does not make any

603
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,240
>> but you know this is not entirely unlike

604
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,919
the kind of puzzle that Scott does. I

605
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,679
mean, sure, this is there's this one

606
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,200
particular uh uh piece of plastic that

607
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,039
uh that the game is designed to work

608
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,320
with, but basically it's just, you know,

609
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,200
it's like a book, right? It's like a

610
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,039
book of puzzles. Um

611
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,600
so there there are also solutions in

612
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,559
here, but I I find the solutions harder

613
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,039
to read than others.

614
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,000
>> Pad recognition was in the book.

615
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,240
>> Was it brand book?

616
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,559
>> Yeah.

617
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,880
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, actually that's um

618
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,520
that's probably a good a good excuse to

619
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,039
switch over to Brenda's. Uh well,

620
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,240
actually before that I want to talk a

621
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:01,039
little bit about tangs. I mean everyone

622
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,520
play the tangs.

623
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,200
>> No. Okay. So, you know the basic idea is

624
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,039
you got these shapes. Um is this

625
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,400
magnetic? Yeah, it is.

626
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,840
>> Cool. Um, you've got these shapes and if

627
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,760
you assemble them right, as the box,

628
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,679
this is usually displayed on the side of

629
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,840
a box somewhere. Where the heck are we

630
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,080
on the inside?

631
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,720
>> I I've got a big P picture on the side

632
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,760
is that um you can actually fit all of

633
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,080
these uh shapes inside that square. So,

634
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,720
these are basically just a square that's

635
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,520
been divided in in in a specific way.

636
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,440
So

637
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,480
once I got this assembled, everyone can

638
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,000
just like pass this around. Anyone who's

639
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,840
already seen it can pass it on. That one

640
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,760
doesn't fit very well, but I think it's

641
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:58,000
cool now. Hey, that's tada. Hey, so this

642
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,640
is the basic set. This is No.

643
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,880
Um, this is now this is how it's been

644
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,520
sold at least is that this is actually a

645
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,559
calendar. So every day you get a

646
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,240
different shape.

647
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,240
>> It's a cute little thing. You know, some

648
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
of them have pretty rudimentary like

649
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,440
geometric shape. Some of them have like

650
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,600
I think this is supposed to be a sphinx

651
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,240
or some kind. Yeah, it looks like a

652
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,880
frog.

653
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,880
>> But this looks like a Pac-Man.

654
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,360
Um

655
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,360
you know and you know

656
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,159
um so the idea is that uh you know you

657
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,960
rearrange those particular shapes into

658
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,880
all of these different shapes and uh you

659
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,799
know it's it's you could play the game

660
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,559
without getting these puzzle solutions,

661
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,320
right? And Scott Ken talks about a lot

662
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
about like first if you've got a toy

663
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,200
that's worth playing with, now you've

664
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
got the beginning of something that

665
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,799
would be a good thing. The nice thing

666
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
about tipover is that it's kind of fun

667
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,720
to tip over things.

668
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,320
And the thing about tangs is that I

669
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,679
actually had more fun playing with tangs

670
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,039
than trying to solve specific problem

671
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,760
just like just trying to rearrange

672
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,840
these. Who hasn't seen these before?

673
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,840
Get a sense of

674
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,840
>> wow.

675
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,240
be ashamed to yourself

676
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,919
and uh

677
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,919
>> and all the work that you did is gone.

678
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,039
>> But that's the thing is that you know as

679
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,200
a toy you know it doesn't really matter

680
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
right because it's just it's just a it's

681
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
just a piece a set of pieces that can be

682
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,480
configuring anything and you kind of

683
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,039
want to take it apart and you know make

684
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,039
new shapes with it like little house.

685
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,880
Um,

686
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,880
so you know, if you've got something

687
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,360
that's kind of fun to fiddle with to

688
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,320
begin with, you've got possibly the

689
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,000
beginning of a game in general, uh, but,

690
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,080
uh, the way how Scott was talking about

691
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,840
it, there's this intermediate step where

692
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,919
it's a puzzle, you know, it's this it's

693
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,840
a toy with a specific solution that

694
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,360
you're trying to get to. And then gaming

695
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,960
is kind of like one step beyond that

696
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,159
where now there's like multiple

697
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,360
solutions and competitive uh at least

698
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,960
that's that's how he was constructing

699
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,320
it. He's not really a game theorist. He

700
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
just puzzles.

701
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,080
>> He talks about in terms of a goal,

702
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
right? So that with a toy that you don't

703
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
have a goal but then with a puzzle you

704
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
have

705
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,000
>> you have you have one goal with no

706
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,200
interaction and then a game is many with

707
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,960
interaction

708
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,039
>> and possibly multiple goals as well. I

709
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
don't know but but again it becomes more

710
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,279
and more directed whereas toy is very

711
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,159
free form. So, so there are people who

712
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,919
describe games uh like the Sims for

713
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,960
instance as actually toys, you know, and

714
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,200
in the same way that you describe a

715
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,000
dollhouse as a toy, the Sims is kind of

716
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,679
like the digital uh digital dollhouse.

717
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,240
But later versions of the Sims kind of

718
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,760
like added more and more specific roles

719
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,400
like you know and now you have to throw

720
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,679
a party with at least five people in it

721
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,000
uh or you have to attain career level

722
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,400
you know five or something like that. Um

723
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,400
I can't remember exactly how you how you

724
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
mentioned it but then that kind of like

725
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,840
has that whole we are going to give more

726
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,400
and more specific things for you to work

727
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,200
towards but it but the Sims is very

728
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,039
careful not to lose its toy sense the

729
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,679
sense of you can if you really wanted to

730
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,039
just dig around with these guys just go

731
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,880
right ahead just just just uh just uh uh

732
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,520
just play around with them and see what

733
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,200
happens. Um, so yeah.

734
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,520
>> Why is there a distinction for physical

735
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,000
objects between toys and games? But for

736
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,200
like video games like Minecraft is

737
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,400
technically still a game, but it's

738
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,159
different modes. Yeah,

739
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,360
>> I guess it has different modes, but it's

740
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,200
more of a toy. I think

741
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,760
>> I would say that that's entirely

742
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,559
marketing. That's the only reason is um

743
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,760
people haven't figured out how to sell

744
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,600
digital toys and there are games idolis

745
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,440
in like Best Buy and and so well there's

746
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
this fun thing I'm going to put in the

747
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
game section. Everyone starts calling it

748
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,679
games and that's kind of the same the

749
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,000
same thing with the Sims is like really

750
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:55,480
the Sims should be its own genre but you

751
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,480
can't sell its own genre that well. So

752
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,799
was there a hand over here?

753
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,919
Um,

754
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:08,400
okay. So, so that's um that's some of

755
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,240
the stuff with Brenda's uh uh with it

756
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,440
starts reading. First, let's move on to

757
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,799
Brenda's. Um, and she's very specific

758
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,799
about the kinds of puzzles that she's

759
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,000
talking about. There's these things that

760
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,840
get in the way of a very specific

761
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,320
narrative experience that a game wants

762
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,000
to you to to guide you through. She she

763
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,880
describes them more as roadblocks than

764
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,039
anything else. um but you know things to

765
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,960
sort of like make the challenge higher

766
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,360
but possibly so high that no one's going

767
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,279
to be able to get past it. Um, some of

768
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,600
her examples are things that come up as

769
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,320
sort of intermittent but optional

770
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,159
mechanics like hacking in bio in in in

771
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,159
Bioshock. And sometimes there are like

772
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,600
things that you have to solve. Uh,

773
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,360
especially in adventure games, there's

774
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,799
this you have to combine this object

775
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,360
with that object and bring it to a

776
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,880
specific location and then now you have

777
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,320
to, you know, uh, and now you you you

778
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,720
can proceed with whatever narrative

779
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,399
you've got. She had this spec this

780
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,440
specific axe to grind against.

781
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,039
puzzles having meaningful rewards or not

782
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,600
being completely blocking. So for

783
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,520
instance, she says you should never have

784
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,000
a a puzzle being required to open a

785
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,720
door. She said solve a puzzle and then

786
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,919
get some kind of tangible reward like or

787
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,799
something. This is after I spent like

788
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,200
the bus ride to New York City playing

789
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,200
Professor Leon

790
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,200
which was like nonstop. We found a door.

791
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,200
It's got a lock on it. looks like a

792
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,200
puzzle.

793
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,360
So, I wasn't entirely sure what to make

794
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,279
of that. I thought that like my

795
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,960
professor Leighton experience was fine

796
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,039
and I didn't need to get fat laton loot

797
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,760
from

798
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,080
>> that's that's actually something. Yeah.

799
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,240
And and uh there's a really good article

800
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,720
actually written by Clara over in our

801
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,039
lab that actually was an article. It was

802
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,600
a it was a transcript of the talk that

803
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,000
she gave at Austin GDC. I I'll send out

804
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,000
the link to everyone about how you can

805
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,360
integrate and why you should integrate

806
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,440
puzzles really really well in the

807
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,000
narrative. It's like really why is there

808
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,399
a puzzle in your game at all unless it's

809
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,720
been integrated into narrative. Um and

810
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,240
Brenda seems to be sort of providing a

811
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
cautionary

812
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,679
uh you know tale of the but if you do it

813
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,200
badly no one can get on with the story.

814
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,960
No one can enjoy the rest of the game.

815
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,559
Becomes this one thing that prevents you

816
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,919
from proceeding. Is there anyone who

817
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:36,120
kind of had that moment and then

818
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,120
>> about 5 minutes into mist

819
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,360
>> I think three

820
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,480
>> I don't know they had sort of some cool

821
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,360
like live action video and stuff and it

822
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,240
looked like it could be like an

823
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
interesting story and I was kind of

824
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,559
amused by the technological prowess of

825
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,159
integrating like video into 3D and then

826
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,679
suddenly I like looked into the picture

827
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,200
and I was on an island and and then

828
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,799
there was nothing happening and I had to

829
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,880
turn things to face each other and I

830
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,279
couldn't figure it out.

831
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,399
>> I definitely had that when I originally

832
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,600
played The Legend of Zelda the original

833
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,600
one where so I don't know if you don't

834
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,480
so they didn't tell you anything pretty

835
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,520
much. And so the temples you have, you

836
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,200
just walk around. There's something

837
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,960
that's like, okay, there's a tree in a

838
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,320
forest. You're supposed to cut, you're

839
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,520
supposed to burn this particular one.

840
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,600
And and there's the entrance to the to

841
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,640
this temple that you can't perceive

842
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,360
until you do this thing. And so it's

843
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,559
just like, how am I supposed to know

844
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,159
that I'm supposed to burn this

845
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,840
particular tree in the middle of this

846
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,320
huge map?

847
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,840
>> Did you beat any of the other

848
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,279
>> Yeah. And they didn't say anything. No,

849
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,760
I mean the others.

850
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,320
>> Yeah.

851
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,080
>> Yeah.

852
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,320
>> Actually, yesterday we are time again.

853
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,120
So,

854
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,720
>> I mean that tells you

855
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,120
>> I was just saying so the interesting

856
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,640
thing is so most people nowadays they

857
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,159
end up playing like the Ocarina of Time

858
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
and George Mass and start moving

859
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,440
backwards. So then end up playing Zelda

860
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
the first Zelda after having played

861
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,000
these old ones.

862
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,640
>> So you sort of know that you're expected

863
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,960
to do these random things to get like

864
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,919
across. So I feel like it's easier for

865
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,080
people. But then,

866
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,120
>> but with the original Zelda, the you

867
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,120
know how in new ones they have like it's

868
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,440
like let's say a wall you can blow up.

869
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,640
It's discolored or something. And the in

870
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,559
this one

871
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,000
>> every tree looks exactly the same. They

872
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,360
use the same sprites.

873
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,679
>> If I remember correctly though, it's

874
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,840
placed such that it's like in the center

875
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,480
of your screen, right? So it does look a

876
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,120
little bit different.

877
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,840
>> No, no,

878
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,799
>> it was like

879
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,600
>> it was just a random tree.

880
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,360
>> Band of trees.

881
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,919
>> Yeah, it was just a whole bunch of

882
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,919
trees.

883
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,760
And so you just you really just have to

884
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,080
get a whatever like a type of thing to

885
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,120
burn it and a specific one

886
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,799
>> and burn it. Usually that place is a

887
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,440
little suspicious. So I think there was

888
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,840
like a one tile column like you could

889
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,880
like navigate around just like this like

890
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,880
loop you just entered and was

891
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,880
suspicious.

892
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,240
>> I feel very frustrated by games that

893
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,399
like require walkthroughs in order to

894
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,159
play them. Sure. And that was the other

895
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,679
thing that she said that she suggested

896
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,760
some game designers do. They put the

897
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,200
solution in the the the Prima guide so

898
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,039
that you have to buy the Prima guide in

899
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,880
order to otherwise.

900
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,919
>> But it's also

901
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,080
deal with the

902
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,880
>> Well, you must have Oh,

903
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,720
>> yeah.

904
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,120
>> There's actually say official on the top

905
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,279
for a reason.

906
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,919
See, it's also ironic because modern

907
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,840
Zelda games like they they hold it's

908
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,200
very obvious that you have to use this

909
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,720
or that item.

910
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,559
>> You got a key. Use this key to open.

911
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,399
>> Oh, you got this item in the dungeon.

912
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,360
You had to use this item to kill the

913
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,000
boss. That sort of thing. Like it's

914
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,519
blatant.

915
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,480
>> Well, for people who are really really

916
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,679
hopeless, there's the little fairy.

917
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,480
>> Hey, listen. Listen. is usually less

918
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,480
less useful than

919
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,799
>> but I mean I mean so one big difference

920
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,480
between the old Zelda games and the new

921
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,600
Zelda games it's just this continual

922
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,320
refinement in the user interface um and

923
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,360
you know in it goes all the way from

924
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,039
like little things like um like the like

925
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,760
the notes that you hear when you find a

926
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,080
new dungeon you know and when you hear

927
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,880
exactly when precisely you hear the

928
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,880
sound of you know

929
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,080
if I think

930
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,640
um you know as a clue that now you have

931
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,480
opened a door um that that that's one of

932
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,080
those things that if you if you look at

933
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,640
postmodms of ocarina time I think

934
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,799
there's a couple on gamma sudra exactly

935
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,600
when that sound plays is a decision that

936
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,360
was very carefully designed um and uh it

937
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,880
seems to me that in digital puzzles in

938
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,080
those kinds of like especially in some

939
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,000
sort of narrative structure like in

940
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,200
opera um that's the big problem that you

941
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,440
have to solve you have to give enough

942
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,720
clues you have to give enough UI

943
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,919
feedback and you have to think about

944
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,679
your UI so hard um in a way that is

945
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,679
going to make it possible for people to

946
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,720
get all the information they need. So

947
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,360
say that burning fire tree situation if

948
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,039
there's nowhere else in the world for

949
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,879
you to get that information that's bad

950
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,480
design puzzle. If there is a guy in I I

951
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,240
can't remember the Zelda one, but if

952
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,520
there is a guy who actually tells you

953
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,919
that that's the tree that you need to

954
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,679
burn, but it's not obvious, especially

955
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,960
for someone who hasn't encountered that

956
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,399
guy, that that's where you get the

957
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
information. It's still a bad design

958
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,359
puzzle, even though now that's the

959
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,760
solution. Um but thinking about and some

960
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,079
examples will be u in a lot of textbased

961
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,720
adventures as well as graphical text

962
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,960
heavy graphical adventures you have a I

963
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,240
can't solve this puzzle but what my

964
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,560
character says to the player about why

965
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,639
you can't solve the puzzle itself a clue

966
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,560
it's like I must not have had I I must

967
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,159
not have the right item like you know

968
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,359
maybe there's something else I can use.

969
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,200
That's a huge clue. I feel like digital

970
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,599
puzzle games have gotten really good at

971
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,159
integrating hint systems

972
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,040
um in recent years,

973
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,079
but I can't think of any physical

974
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,200
puzzles that I've come across, though I

975
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,000
may just not have caught it like been up

976
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,079
to speed with physical puzzles that have

977
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,320
that kind of

978
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,400
not totally revealing the solution, but

979
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,640
giving you a gradual hint which can help

980
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,560
you figure it out. Well, mystery hunt

981
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,320
puzzle is kind of

982
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,320
>> Oh,

983
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,320
this

984
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,520
describe the mystery hunt for folks who

985
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,000
don't who

986
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,960
>> uh it's basically it's a competition run

987
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,599
at MIT over AP where uh teams of people

988
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,520
compete to solve a bunch of puzzles like

989
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,760
70 puzzles that kind of build on each

990
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,280
other. So you have, you know, say 20

991
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,520
base puzzles and you solve those 20

992
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,119
puzzles, you get 20 words as solutions

993
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,720
and then those 20 words become a new

994
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,920
puzzle and it's a meta puzzle and it

995
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,599
keep kind of keeps going like that for a

996
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,880
couple layers. But the point is the

997
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,440
winning team from the previous year

998
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,720
writes the next year's mystery hunt. So

999
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,320
like you get all kinds of varying

1000
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,040
puzzles of varying difficulties and

1001
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,480
styles and a very well-designed puzzle

1002
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,320
actually does that because you have this

1003
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,680
thing called flavor. Oh, I guess I

1004
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,079
should say that the puzzles aren't like

1005
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,839
sudoku or crosswords. You literally just

1006
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,040
get, you know, something on a screen or

1007
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,320
something on a piece of paper and you

1008
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
have to figure out what to do with it.

1009
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,680
You're not given any instructions for

1010
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,440
how to solve it whatsoever. And the the

1011
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,359
only clues you get are either by the

1012
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,359
title of the puzzle, by like the group

1013
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,520
of puzzles that it's in, or by this

1014
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,680
thing called flavor text, which is like

1015
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,040
they say some kind of random phrase that

1016
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,720
seems to not have anything to do with

1017
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,720
anything, but that kind of gives you a

1018
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,000
clue about what to do in the first

1019
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,520
puzzle.

1020
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,960
>> So that's it's kind of like what you're

1021
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,160
describing. That's interesting because I

1022
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,560
mean it's really challenging when you

1023
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,560
don't have any mechanism for like giving

1024
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,440
feedback to the person who's working on

1025
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,280
a puzzle. It in Zelda or what have you.

1026
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,040
You can see that they've spent a long

1027
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,599
time

1028
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,960
 around.

1029
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,560
It's kind of a double-edged sword in

1030
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,560
that particular case because you had so

1031
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,160
many mechanisms and now you're expected

1032
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,079
to use all of them. Uh in in in in a

1033
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,640
game like like you have to use sound,

1034
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,200
you have to use contextual buttons, you

1035
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,440
have to use the inventory, uh the

1036
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,880
position of the player matters, you

1037
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,280
know, sometimes I've seen games where

1038
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,119
the the main clue is what is the the

1039
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,640
character looking at for instance, you

1040
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,839
know, and if you walk around, why does

1041
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,920
my character keep looking that way every

1042
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:19,440
time I look at it? Oh, that's the clue,

1043
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,560
you know. Um so so yeah for us in a lot

1044
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,720
of like um physical stuff um I would say

1045
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,160
that one of the reasons is if you're

1046
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,440
starting if you're starting to build

1047
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,599
these physical games from toys um you a

1048
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,440
lot of the affordances

1049
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,880
a a lot of things you could possibly do

1050
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,280
are kind of built into the physical

1051
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,599
object. Uh, and if you're building a

1052
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,160
puzzle based on what you could do as

1053
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,320
with these things as a toy, um, then

1054
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,480
you're necessarily already using the

1055
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,960
constraints of what you can do it do

1056
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,520
with it as a toy in order to try to to

1057
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,520
to create a puzzle.

1058
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,680
Um,

1059
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,000
this might be a good exercise actually.

1060
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,200
We have time we we we we could take a

1061
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,040
shot at this and just like you know

1062
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,280
trying to come up with a puzzle and see

1063
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,040
but instead of doing of imagining one in

1064
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,560
a digital space trying to imagine one in

1065
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,200
physical space and because I suspect

1066
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,839
what you actually get is that you get a

1067
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,520
lot of free you get a free ride with

1068
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,119
physical puzzles because things

1069
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,160
physically

1070
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:25,760
have interactions that puzzle

1071
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,640
I feel like uh played Portal recently

1072
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,440
and that's a game where like

1073
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,040
the the puzzles are it's not in a I mean

1074
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
obviously it's still a digital game but

1075
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,920
the puzzles are very much physical

1076
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,119
puzzles like you kind of have an idea

1077
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,000
about what has have people played Portal

1078
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,839
of course or know the idea

1079
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,560
okay um I mean you have these two

1080
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,640
portals and you like do you understand

1081
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,400
what the physics is going to be like so

1082
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,839
the puzzles aren't frustrating in the

1083
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,200
sense that it's like oh you pull you

1084
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,800
realize there's like this random statue

1085
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,040
here and if you like pull a lever it

1086
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,440
like raises the water level or something

1087
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,359
like that like it I don't know what it

1088
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,440
but it's like it's very intuitive and

1089
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,760
it's it feels like a physical puzzle in

1090
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,760
the sense that I know what will happen

1091
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,000
if I do this and I just figure out have

1092
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,359
to how to put the pieces together and

1093
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,440
also in portal what I think does a

1094
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,240
really good job of as well as what some

1095
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,200
physical puzzles do is having a learning

1096
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,960
curve like tanagram will have some basic

1097
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,720
puzzles or I'm sure the following thing

1098
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,440
a lot of them we can do physical puzzle

1099
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,320
things we like I don't know have to jump

1100
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,440
over pieces or whatever basic levels,

1101
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,359
basic uh boards where they show you

1102
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,720
various techniques and you only have to

1103
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,920
figure out one technique and it's very

1104
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,880
obvious what you have to do and then

1105
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,599
later on you have to use those

1106
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,839
techniques.

1107
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,079
>> Well, I mean in zippover this particular

1108
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,440
example does something that portal also

1109
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,160
does really well is that the very first

1110
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,480
puzzle that we did earlier only has one

1111
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,400
solution and you do not you do not get

1112
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,480
that solution unless you understand all

1113
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,520
the mechanics. Yeah. like we like we

1114
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,800
tried to solve it a bunch of different

1115
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,400
times and it's like because we didn't

1116
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,079
quite understand the rules, we couldn't

1117
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,960
get it until we understood the mechanics

1118
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,800
of the game. Now we can sly solve it. So

1119
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,320
from level from puzzle level two

1120
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,960
onwards, we can be confident that we

1121
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,640
actually know like Portal and even

1122
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,079
actually just about any well-designed

1123
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,760
game, but I'm going to say Portal is a

1124
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,200
fine example. you've beaten the game,

1125
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,079
you can play through the game again with

1126
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,240
developer commentary. And you will and

1127
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,760
when you hear that, you will actually

1128
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,760
realize that um every single fairly

1129
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,920
intuitive physical thing that that that

1130
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,160
you pick up in the game had to be taught

1131
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,440
to you. And they've designed the level

1132
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,079
very clearly. So, right at the beginning

1133
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,520
of the game, if uh folks can remember,

1134
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,560
um you're trapped in a little cell,

1135
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:41,280
right? and uh the the uh GLaDOS talks to

1136
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,000
you and a portal opens and you can walk

1137
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,280
through it. What do you see out of the

1138
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
first portal that opens?

1139
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
>> You see yourself going into the other

1140
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,480
one.

1141
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,040
>> You see yourself going through the other

1142
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,680
portal. It is like they force you to

1143
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,280
have to look at what the basic game

1144
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
mechanic is going to be before you can

1145
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,800
do anything else in game that's

1146
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,440
productive in game. uh you know you can

1147
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,480
pick up the radio but yeah

1148
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,640
so so you know u so you know that's that

1149
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,079
that was a design decision they could

1150
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,280
have made that they they could have

1151
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,640
decided not to make it they could have

1152
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,200
made you just go through that into a

1153
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,400
different room and you and and and a

1154
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,400
learning opportunity would have been

1155
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,680
lost right there um so if you got a copy

1156
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,440
of portal I would suggest go back and

1157
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,079
play through the the developer comment

1158
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,040
tries because they're they're hilarious

1159
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,000
and they're also really really good for

1160
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,680
demonstrating

1161
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
in this room. This is what we had to do

1162
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,240
in order to make people get it. Um, I'm

1163
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,440
also thinking of things like Mario World

1164
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,040
one where like you don't get to you

1165
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,160
don't get very far unless you get the

1166
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,920
basic game mechanics down and but they

1167
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,280
make it really gentle in that I don't

1168
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,560
think there are any pits that instant

1169
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,440
instantly choke you.

1170
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,880
>> Yeah, that's exactly what I was

1171
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,000
thinking. Mario World, the first Gamma

1172
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,240
Suture article we read on uh like game

1173
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,400
distractions from Rich Mario World that

1174
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,319
he's like you expect the same kind of

1175
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,720
actions to be consistent all the time

1176
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,319
jumping and I guess you kind of look at

1177
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,839
like different things there like double

1178
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,960
jumping like that specific puzzle

1179
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,720
also. I mean a lot of Mario's things uh

1180
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,319
uh worlds are made up basically as

1181
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,160
spatial puzzles, right? and it's like

1182
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,920
you know you have to get there but you

1183
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,319
don't know exactly how you're going to

1184
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,040
use all the mechanics that you got.

1185
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,280
>> Um in Mario 64

1186
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,119
I think their way of solving the the

1187
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,200
impass problem of not locking off all

1188
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,960
the content from the game because of one

1189
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,040
puzzle you can't get giving you so much

1190
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,599
to do that even if they don't really

1191
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,560
tell you and even if a good 30 40% are

1192
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,000
going to remain mysterious to you and

1193
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,680
you're not able to figure them out

1194
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,280
there's so much to jump around between

1195
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,720
that you're never locked off from a

1196
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,640
significant amount of content. So you

1197
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,800
you you've got the hublike structure of

1198
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,359
like you can do any one of five

1199
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,040
different things at any given time plus

1200
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,400
all plus you have sort of secondary

1201
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,680
solutions like you can always go back to

1202
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,079
a world that you've been before and try

1203
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,079
to put all the stars.

1204
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,880
Um I think that's kind of what Brenda

1205
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,880
was kind of indicating of the you don't

1206
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,440
necessarily want if you're putting

1207
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,720
puzzles in your game. she was advocating

1208
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,440
for Brenda and Ian were were advocating

1209
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,599
for something that wouldn't that that

1210
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,200
wasn't necessary to progress on on to

1211
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:20,560
the next one. But I think that's

1212
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,560
I think that's not a requirement. I

1213
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,960
think that's a if you want to make your

1214
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,359
life easier, this is what you do. If you

1215
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,520
decide that you're up to the task, you

1216
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,240
can achieve some really amazing effects

1217
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,319
by having your puzzles narratively

1218
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,920
important. Um, so there's um,

1219
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,880
uh, has anyone heard of the game called

1220
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,160
Eternal Darkness? It's, uh, sort of the

1221
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,839
craftian horror game on the Gamecube?

1222
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,920
Uh, I'll sort of describe it, but

1223
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,119
basically the whole basic idea is that

1224
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,960
you have four gods all waring, all

1225
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,319
waring against each other. Three of them

1226
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,560
hate one of them, but then those three

1227
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,079
of them hate each other. and and most of

1228
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,040
the puzzles are just sort of

1229
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,839
understanding that there is this there's

1230
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,680
this mystical logic you know one god

1231
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,920
defeats another god defeats another god

1232
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,440
in a rock paper scissor circle and all

1233
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,359
of them hate this one other thing um so

1234
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,040
um early on in the game there's actually

1235
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,440
a puzzle there are actually a number of

1236
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,119
different p uh p puzzles where you see

1237
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,640
the symbols of these gods and you have

1238
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,480
to kind of rearrange them in the correct

1239
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,319
order and the rest of the game is all

1240
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,079
going to be like variations on sort of

1241
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,760
understanding what these gods do to each

1242
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,920
other. So those those are all puzzles

1243
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,520
that inform you about how the world

1244
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,160
works. Um that and that's that kind of

1245
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,760
works in two ways. One information that

1246
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,760
you've already gathered about the world

1247
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,480
about how this world works gives you

1248
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,920
clues on how to beat the puzzles.

1249
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,119
Beating the puzzles, finding the

1250
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,880
solutions for the clues gives you

1251
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,800
information about how the world works.

1252
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,040
And that's that's kind of like the holy

1253
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,400
grail of a puzzle designer in a digital

1254
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,160
game is that you're going to design a

1255
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,920
puzzle that's going to reinforce how the

1256
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,520
world works. Um we there's a chap um who

1257
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,640
gave a talk and I believe his name is

1258
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,480
Jeff Howard. He came to um he came to

1259
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,319
camp and gave a talk last

1260
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,200
>> last year and um and he makes this case

1261
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:16,160
that games and the logic in that that

1262
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:19,359
you present in games uh do basically uh

1263
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,880
the equivalent of what magic does in of

1264
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,760
what magic systems actually do in the

1265
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,160
real world. you know, um what people

1266
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,800
like like like

1267
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:33,280
oultists or astrologers or they

1268
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,599
basically give you logics on, you know,

1269
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,760
uh that that that explain how the world

1270
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,280
is going to work. One that may not

1271
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,960
necessarily be obvious, but if you knew

1272
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,640
this knowledge, you'd be able to

1273
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,560
understand how this will work in you.

1274
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,319
But more importantly, you'll be able to

1275
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,560
do things in the world that you know

1276
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,119
that that allow you to accomplish things

1277
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,880
uh uh that you wouldn't otherwise do.

1278
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,560
Learning a game is very much like like

1279
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,839
like like that. You know, it's like I

1280
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,839
don't know how this world works, but if

1281
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,359
I understood these particular rules, I

1282
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,960
could be able to accomplish greater

1283
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:04,880
things. Um and puzzles can be one of

1284
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,720
those things where where it becomes a

1285
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,720
test, right? It becomes a test of just

1286
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,200
exactly how well do you understand this?

1287
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,760
uh even if it's like in a combat game

1288
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,680
like uh Quick or God of War or

1289
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,920
something, you know, I can understand

1290
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,520
how the combat system basically works if

1291
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,119
I just keep mashing the X button or

1292
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,560
something or just like shoot everything

1293
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,240
with rockets. Um but if I really really

1294
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,520
understand the combat system, I might be

1295
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,000
able to hit something that I wouldn't

1296
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,160
necessarily be able to hit. I might be

1297
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,960
able to um I might be able to take down

1298
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,520
a a horde of enemies instead of like

1299
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,880
taking them down one at a time. Um I

1300
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,040
might be able to beat a boss. And

1301
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,960
actually a lot of boss boss battles in

1302
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,119
digital games are actually puzzles.

1303
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,200
There's not it's not how well do you

1304
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,000
generally react, it's can you figure out

1305
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,000
the pattern. Um but that pattern makes

1306
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,160
no doesn't mean anything unless you've

1307
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,440
already figured out how all your other

1308
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:02,000
combat skills work. So, a boss battle in

1309
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,680
Zelda only makes sense if you figured

1310
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,680
out how that one item that you picked up

1311
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,640
in the dungeon works really, really

1312
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,200
well. You know, okay, it shoots fire.

1313
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,119
That means not only does it hurt things

1314
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,599
from distance, it also lights certain

1315
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,920
things on fire. And that's what a Zelda

1316
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,680
boss battle basically is. Combining this

1317
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,520
latest ability that I got with

1318
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,200
everything else that you've done before

1319
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,680
into taking it down. That's why boss

1320
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,760
puzzle battle is kind of like a puzzle.

1321
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,520
Um,

1322
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,599
one thing I wanted to say before I go

1323
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,200
on, you're asking about like hints in a

1324
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,920
physical puzzle. And the one thing that

1325
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,280
jumped to my mind was um, a couple years

1326
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,200
ago, the weekly dig, I don't know if

1327
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,119
anyone reads it, it's like a free Boston

1328
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,839
newspaper. And there was a cross word

1329
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,079
puzzles for the longest time. They were

1330
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,319
thematic. And so you would have a guest

1331
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,200
cross lord and uh, like the first one I

1332
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:54,800
ever did was Hulk Hogan. So all of all

1333
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,359
of the hints in the cross word puzzle

1334
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,280
are related to Hulk Hogan. So it's a

1335
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,960
question of like not what does this mean

1336
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,000
to me, but what would it mean to Hulk

1337
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,520
Hogan? And um and they don't do it

1338
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,800
anymore, which is really depressing

1339
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,880
because every week it was somewhat

1340
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,640
different. And it kind of it was like a

1341
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,680
built-in hint, right? As you weren't,

1342
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,560
you didn't just think about it

1343
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,800
literally. You have to kind of

1344
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,359
contextualize it. You can think about

1345
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,000
all the things that come with the puzzle

1346
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,160
as potential in players introduced sense

1347
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
like the title like the play the text as

1348
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,119
you were describing the fact that it's

1349
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,640
in the like like the fact that you get a

1350
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,480
puzzle and mystery hunts immediately

1351
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,720
clues you in that maybe the solution for

1352
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,720
this lies in a different puzzle that not

1353
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,960
the one that I'm currently looking at

1354
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,160
right now because that's how mystery

1355
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,680
hunt things are. Um,

1356
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,880
uh,

1357
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,280
Metal Gear Solid is, uh, has a really,

1358
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,640
really bizarre one where, uh,

1359
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,640
>> look in the back case.

1360
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,640
>> Yes. Where they tell you, oh, there's a

1361
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,240
specific radio frequency that you need.

1362
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,520
It's written in the back of the box and

1363
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,960
it's like the back of the box

1364
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,720
or antipiriracy.

1365
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,760
>> Yeah. I mean, yes, but it's still a

1366
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,440
puzzle, you know. It's like, you know,

1367
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,839
to solve that. I mean, they were pretty

1368
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,599
obvious because uh or maybe it's just me

1369
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,520
because it took me about half an hour to

1370
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,880
figure that one out.

1371
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,400
>> Took me some hours.

1372
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,960
>> I mean, Middle Gear Hell did a lot of

1373
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,119
like meta puzzles like that. Like when

1374
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,480
when you fought Psycho Mantis the first

1375
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,920
time

1376
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,359
>> Well, so the thing you had to do is you

1377
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,960
had to unplug your controller and plug

1378
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,720
it into the second port because he would

1379
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,800
read your movements

1380
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,720
>> and it it was just like it was this cool

1381
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,319
like physical layer of it where like

1382
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,599
you're playing the game, you realize I

1383
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,119
have to interact with the physical

1384
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,760
world. so that he can't see what I'm

1385
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,240
doing.

1386
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,880
>> But but actually that one had a clue

1387
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,040
because if you had a in that particular

1388
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,880
example, that one gave you a very big

1389
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,760
clue because right at the beginning of

1390
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,440
that match, uh that boss tells you to

1391
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,200
put your controller on the ground and he

1392
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,800
said that I'm going to control this this

1393
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,800
controller with my mind and actually

1394
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,400
just right.

1395
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,319
>> That's only if you have DualS. So since

1396
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,160
it was on PlayStation,

1397
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,079
>> uh if you didn't, he just ignored that

1398
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,760
part and you didn't you didn't get that

1399
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,000
clue at all. Yeah, that and that's a

1400
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,520
problem. But but it's still it's still

1401
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,119
very

1402
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,720
>> there were other clues.

1403
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,240
>> There were also other clues like you

1404
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,000
would talk about how you had been

1405
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,559
playing certain games by reading saves

1406
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,720
on your

1407
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,920
>> I think it was on your notion

1408
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,640
of the night.

1409
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,960
>> Those are the ones.

1410
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,319
>> So So basically it's it's telling you

1411
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,359
it's giving you a clue that there

1412
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,800
there's going to be something better

1413
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,960
about the way that you're currently

1414
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,200
playing. Uh, the funny thing about the

1415
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,040
radio channel one is that that one

1416
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,000
really did not give you any clues that

1417
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,680
it was something better. It just told

1418
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,559
you about it at the back at the back of

1419
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,640
the box. It is like and it didn't tell

1420
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,319
you the back of the case, the the video

1421
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,000
game case, right? It's not going to be

1422
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,559
that explicit. It's a CD case

1423
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,280
specifically.

1424
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,960
>> Oh, CD case.

1425
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,800
>> Yeah, I appreciate I I was really

1426
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,079
confused cuz I think mine came in like a

1427
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,280
slip of paper or something.

1428
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,760
>> Oh, yeah.

1429
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,160
>> Yeah, if you buy it used or something.

1430
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,960
>> Wow. So, it's anti-use game protection

1431
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,160
as well. But uh yeah, mine was Yeah, I

1432
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,599
think mine actually said at the back of

1433
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,280
the CD case, but I was playing like a

1434
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,880
re-release or something and that came in

1435
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,480
the the DVD case. So, I didn't make that

1436
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,000
connection, but you know, if you look at

1437
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,359
the back of it, you see the you you

1438
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,200
you'll see what the radio frequency is

1439
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,960
in a um in the screenshot. What one of

1440
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,559
the the eight screenshots that they show

1441
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,240
to demonstrate this is what the game is

1442
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,520
all about. There's a number just right

1443
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:26,160
in there and then you keep

1444
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,319
>> behind our

1445
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,000
play of those like breakout games where

1446
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:35,119
you just lock in a room you have to

1447
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,359
>> escape the room

1448
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:42,480
and you find you like find a paper.

1449
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,960
>> So um actually who who doesn't know what

1450
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,640
these are about escape the room.

1451
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,319
>> Okay. So, escape the room. Actually,

1452
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,720
could we bring up something on the

1453
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,800
computer? Let's do that. Grab the video.

1454
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,000
Well, the video cable. I mean, the after

1455
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,920
my office. Oh, okay. Cool. Um, well,

1456
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,520
that

1457
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,000
um escape the room games are typically

1458
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,800
flash games. Uh, and and they're kind of

1459
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,200
like adventure games. You um only

1460
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,559
because there's usually only one room,

1461
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,240
although sometimes they have multiple

1462
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,000
rooms. It's a much smaller world than

1463
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,079
most adventure games, but the basic idea

1464
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,079
is the same. you pick up objects, you

1465
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:21,920
use objects in in in in in in a room and

1466
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,000
you try to make things happen, you know.

1467
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,359
Um, if you haven't made anything happen,

1468
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,359
you are not progressing in the game. If

1469
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,960
you made something happen, you're almost

1470
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,880
certainly making forward progress in the

1471
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,119
game. Um, and and there is actually a a

1472
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,319
guide for playing adventure games

1473
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,960
written by Rob Roberto Williams within

1474
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,800
the original series. and her guide is

1475
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,400
like, "Pick up everything, go

1476
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,559
everywhere, use everything on

1477
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,680
everything." It's like, that's actually

1478
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,960
what the escape room game is, but

1479
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,160
there's a little bit more humane escape

1480
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,680
to room game because there just not that

1481
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,240
many places that you can explore because

1482
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,440
the idea is that you're stuck in a room.

1483
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,800
Um, and uh, and basically it comes down

1484
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,119
to just use everything on everything

1485
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,680
until you figure out what what turns

1486
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,040
out. Rarely isn't logical. Often it

1487
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,480
often pretty entertaining because

1488
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,920
they're animation heavy. So every time

1489
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,200
you do something right, you get some

1490
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,200
crazy animation. I put the fish into the

1491
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,440
male slot and then out appears an

1492
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,480
octopus.

1493
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,680
It's like it's fun to watch. Um whereas

1494
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,839
the kind of combinatorily

1495
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,400
opposite of those are the grow games.

1496
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,520
>> Oh yeah.

1497
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,839
>> Um and there there is a series of games

1498
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,359
called Grow. Um I think the guy who does

1499
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:36,880
them called eyes maze and that's like Z.

1500
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:40,720
Um and and um and the whole basic idea

1501
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:44,160
is that um imagine that you have a

1502
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,400
flower pot and every time you add

1503
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,079
something to it, something happens. But

1504
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,319
the order in which you're adding things

1505
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,839
to it makes different things happen.

1506
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:55,760
>> And there are solutions basically in

1507
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,720
making the optimal number of things h

1508
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,400
happen if you if you if you do it if you

1509
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,559
do it right. So what you can do is not a

1510
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,079
mystery at all. You know, you you have I

1511
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,760
have these six things that I could add

1512
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,119
to my part and it doesn't and and I know

1513
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,640
that's those are the only six things I

1514
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,280
could add. The question is what order do

1515
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,280
I do them? Um and doing them in

1516
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,960
different orders gives you different

1517
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,800
different results. I feel that

1518
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,800
these these two genres are kind of

1519
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,079
linked, but they're not uh but they're

1520
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,359
playing off very different things. One

1521
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,000
of them is I don't know what I'm going

1522
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,000
to do. Uh, but I know that whatever I do

1523
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
is got to be in the space. And the other

1524
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,520
one is very much I know exactly what I

1525
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,720
can possibly do. I just don't know what

1526
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,400
order to do them. So couple of puzzles

1527
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,800
that you see online. These are fairly

1528
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,480
encapsulated things. One one game is one

1529
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,720
series of puzzles. There's no it's not

1530
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,359
like a professor kind of encyclopedia

1531
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,359
puzzles kind of thing.

1532
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,720
Okay. Um, let's see. I I think I'm

1533
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,640
actually going going to grab a few more

1534
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,640
puzzles and bring them in. But, uh, I do

1535
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,400
actually want uh, uh, to try to see

1536
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,680
whether we can put together a list of

1537
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,240
the kinds of puzzles that we haven't

1538
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,760
talked about today. Uh, these could be

1539
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,119
physical puzzles. These could be puzzles

1540
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,480
that you've seen in the book, but like a

1541
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,680
genre. Um, logic puzzles, you know, of a

1542
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,599
certain kind that you either really

1543
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,720
really like or you really really love.

1544
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,520
Um, and just just break up in groups of

1545
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,720
three, four, six, seven, eight, nine.

1546
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,640
I'm going to bring you guys to do this.

1547
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:36,480
10 12 13 15 16 17 people. 17 people.

1548
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:39,720
That doesn't divide at all.

1549
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,720
>> One group.

1550
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,720
>> Okay. Two or three. Groups of two or

1551
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,400
three. And just like

1552
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,799
>> uh Jason should be back.

1553
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:53,200
>> Okay. Then groups then groups of three.

1554
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:54,880
Um and uh right

1555
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,559
>> and

1556
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,160
come up with yeah just like

1557
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,119
>> you know just a couple of puzzles that

1558
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,960
we haven't discussed and you know and a

1559
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,559
description about what they're like and

1560
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,280
we'll just quickly run through the class

1561
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,119
to sort of like give everyone an idea of

1562
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,680
what

1563
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,480
>> a as a toy playing with a Rubik's cube

1564
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,319
is more fun than the algorithm to solve

1565
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,799
it. That's not fun at all in my opinion.

1566
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,960
>> Yeah. Like it's probably you can also

1567
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,960
solve it but there's algorithms there

1568
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,960
very

1569
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,400
>> yeah one of the things you're talking

1570
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,240
about was interactive fiction

1571
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,200
>> and uh

1572
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,720
>> like text

1573
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:40,240
>> yeah text text adventures and how um

1574
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,599
sometimes it could be considered just

1575
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,040
like if you're playing a regular

1576
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:47,359
adventure game but just with text

1577
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,960
instead. And so um the puzzle could be

1578
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,480
how you interact with the world or it

1579
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,119
could be trying to figure out what

1580
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,280
actions are available to the user. Like

1581
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,680
sometimes not all actions are there but

1582
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:01,760
also um in some games the nature of text

1583
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,319
gives you different ways to have a

1584
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,200
puzzle like in a lost pig because you're

1585
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,680
playing in fork. He doesn't know English

1586
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,240
very well or like doesn't doesn't have

1587
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,599
full control of language. So you're

1588
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,880
trying to decipher his words to figure

1589
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,040
out what he's actually saying.

1590
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,520
>> An example they can do give that to make

1591
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,200
it

1592
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,160
>> um I haven't played

1593
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:27,520
>> in that game. There's uh one part where

1594
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,760
he's describing a box and it has a slot

1595
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,040
and you you you put something in it and

1596
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,079
then it gives you something out. But

1597
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,119
like the way he's describing it, you

1598
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,480
don't really know what he's describing

1599
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,760
until you realize he's talking about a

1600
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,520
vending machine.

1601
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,599
Okay.

1602
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,599
>> He describes it as like a tall box with

1603
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,520
that slot in it.

1604
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:47,280
>> Um, and another example we were talking

1605
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:49,280
about was the game Isle, uh, which is

1606
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,000
you're you're this guy in like a grocery

1607
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,319
store and you you have it gives you like

1608
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,319
this big, uh, prologue and you have one

1609
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,640
action that you can do. So after you

1610
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:02,319
type in your one action, it tells you

1611
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,680
what happens and gives you an epilog

1612
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,520
and then the and then the game starts

1613
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,359
over. But then using using the

1614
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,880
information from that epilog, you you

1615
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,319
have a different choice of actions that

1616
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,119
you can take and different keywords to

1617
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,599
use. And so by playing it over and over,

1618
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,599
you're like uncovering more of the story

1619
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,760
until you get somewhere.

1620
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,760
>> So the puzzle solution.

1621
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,920
>> Yeah. Isle A.

1622
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,839
>> Yeah. I want to play

1623
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,720
for the

1624
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,359
game.

1625
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,040
Um, we also thought about puzzles that

1626
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,520
were

1627
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,000
games and put into a very contrived

1628
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,000
scenario like bridge puzzles or chess

1629
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,839
puzzles or back when the duelist

1630
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,200
magazines still existed there. Magic the

1631
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,960
Gathering puzzles.

1632
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,799
>> So, so like like chess puzzles are like

1633
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,040
here's this board. What was the move

1634
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,559
that that that

1635
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,880
black to win in three moves?

1636
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,160
>> Yeah.

1637
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,640
>> Yeah.

1638
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,559
>> Something like that. So that's like you

1639
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,040
you are now placing additional

1640
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,200
constraints on the game.

1641
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,119
>> Yeah, exactly. It already puts you in a

1642
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,440
situation like pretend you're in this

1643
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,119
game now. We promise you there's a way

1644
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,200
you can automatically win. You have to

1645
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,680
find it.

1646
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,440
>> Yeah. There's a number of uh sort of

1647
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,640
computer games like Choo Choo Rocket and

1648
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,200
everything where that's like just a

1649
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,200
completely second.

1650
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,319
>> Chuchu Rocket. Chuchu Rocket. Too rocket

1651
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,920
is a frenetic fourplayer. Um like uh

1652
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,680
>> it's it's a mice hurting game.

1653
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,880
>> Mice mice hurting game.

1654
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,599
>> Get them into rocket ships.

1655
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,000
>> Yeah. So they can go into space.

1656
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,359
>> It is

1657
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,160
for the dream. It's so good.

1658
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,359
>> Oh really?

1659
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,960
>> Really?

1660
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,079
>> The idea is just a whole bunch of mice

1661
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,839
wandering around the screen and each

1662
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,359
player gets to place like three arrows

1663
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:46,240
and whenever the mice run the arrow they

1664
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:47,680
follow the arrow. So you want to get all

1665
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,440
you like want to get the cats and the

1666
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,440
other chips and they eat their mice.

1667
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,119
>> And puzzle mode says you have three

1668
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,720
arrows in these particular directions.

1669
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,240
Figure out where to place them. As much

1670
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,680
time as you want, but there's only one

1671
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,720
one right answer. And that immediately

1672
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,480
shows you the difference between game

1673
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,160
and puzzle where they all

1674
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,119
>> cool.

1675
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:10,319
So uh first off, I don't like jigsaw

1676
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,400
puzzles, but Michelle loves them. And

1677
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,839
then we also talked about who donuts.

1678
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,599
And I really love redemptance because

1679
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,839
it's like what you have to pay attention

1680
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,319
to detail in the story is like the one

1681
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:22,079
thing that like I guess the example that

1682
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,559
we were talking about is if there's a

1683
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,839
mailman it happens to be on a Sunday he

1684
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,680
probably committed the crime because

1685
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,559
they don't have mail on Sundays like

1686
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,200
small details like that.

1687
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,720
>> Are you talking about mystery books or

1688
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,559
just like little paragraphs?

1689
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,160
>> Well, it's usually like a story and they

1690
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,760
say like, "Oh, here's the scenario.

1691
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,559
Here's the background story. Who is the

1692
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,079
who is the murder? Who's the murderer?"

1693
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,319
>> They compiled it though to you. Yeah.

1694
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,119
Yeah.

1695
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:47,359
>> Feels like you told us at parties like

1696
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,480
that like for at parties, right?

1697
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,359
>> That's very true.

1698
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,720
>> Yeah. How

1699
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:54,040
>> I didn't see you was talking for a

1700
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,040
second. That was

1701
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:57,799
talking.

1702
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,359
>> Did we actually

1703
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,280
you guys?

1704
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,799
>> Okay. All right. Uh, another puzzle we

1705
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,559
came up with was uh the the ones that

1706
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,559
you did in elementary school with like

1707
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,760
the the big grid and you would have, you

1708
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,440
know, like someone's name and maybe

1709
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,880
their favorite food and you'd be given a

1710
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,760
bunch of clues and you have to match

1711
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,359
them.

1712
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,160
>> Yeah. With like the checks and the exits

1713
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,680
and stuff.

1714
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,079
>> So,

1715
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,359
I think

1716
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,440
>> they're just generally called logic

1717
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,920
puzzles, I believe. And it's just you're

1718
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:29,119
given the the incomplete set of

1719
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,559
information, but enough constraints that

1720
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,559
you can figure out the rest of the

1721
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,119
information. And really the the way to

1722
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,520
solve it is just like write everybody's

1723
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,000
name, all all the characters that you're

1724
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,920
given in a piece of pros. Write down all

1725
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,599
the characters on one column. Write down

1726
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,440
all the things that you're trying to

1727
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,200
figure out like who's wearing what

1728
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,480
colored shirt for instance. So just

1729
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,880
write out all the colors on the other

1730
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,240
column. And just by the process of of

1731
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,000
elimination, just figuring out um

1732
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,440
usually these the answers are usually

1733
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,960
exclusive, right? So like if somebody's

1734
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,599
wearing a red shirt, the person cannot

1735
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,920
be wearing a green shirt. Um, you know,

1736
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,960
uh, so yeah,

1737
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,480
>> like they're like much harder on like

1738
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,079
every fourth statement is fault. Like

1739
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,920
you don't know one state is definitely

1740
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,079
false. I've seen ones where every

1741
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,520
statement is false except for one. They

1742
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,200
like I can bring in my book and they're

1743
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:22,079
just like hideous.

1744
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,920
>> Uh you the worst version of that is

1745
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:27,079
figuring out how how to see people in

1746
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,079
the wedding.

1747
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:37,000
>> Is that in 6034? Did that last week?

1748
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:37,000
>> Oh, cool.

1749
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:41,760
>> You guys want to throw any?

1750
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,960
>> Sure. Um, we started by trying to think

1751
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,400
of all the puzzles that we really

1752
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,040
dislike and uh we came up with a couple

1753
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,319
here. The sliding square puzzles. You

1754
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:53,920
have like a

1755
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,599
they're basically just a variation on a

1756
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,640
jigsaw puzzle where the rules are more

1757
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:01,680
constrained. Um, I don't like jigsaw

1758
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:04,559
puzzles either.

1759
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,720
Like mine did there. And then John had a

1760
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:10,119
couple like lights out. I guess there's

1761
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,119
a lights out

1762
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,480
certain areas and you have to like flip

1763
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,400
them.

1764
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,760
So, so you got a like like a grid of

1765
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:23,119
buttons and every button you push will

1766
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,359
invert the all the neighboring buttons

1767
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,839
like in I think the top bottom left and

1768
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,839
right will

1769
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,920
>> yeah and then I guess a similar well

1770
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,920
maybe not similar but there's why don't

1771
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,200
you describe the concentric circles

1772
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,839
>> yeah their puzzles are similar that

1773
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,680
we're um taking an action on um one item

1774
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:43,119
in the scene will um these are going to

1775
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,319
be dual puzzles the concentric circle

1776
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:49,599
ones um will uh have effects on other

1777
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:51,200
things in the system. And um uh

1778
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,559
typically these are used in games where

1779
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,520
there'll be like a center podium with a

1780
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,640
pathway leading off of um the center one

1781
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,240
side of the podium. Then there'll be a

1782
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,920
concentric circle around that a

1783
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,079
concentric ring with a pathway off of

1784
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,920
that ring and another angle and then you

1785
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,640
know more and more circles um to each

1786
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,240
side and uh you get to uh rotate

1787
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,280
individual circles and that will rotate

1788
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,480
the other circles in different ways.

1789
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,319
need to

1790
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,440
>> create every time I rotate one something

1791
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,440
else is going to rotate.

1792
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,640
>> Yeah. And there's always like it's

1793
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:20,559
always thrown like right before like a

1794
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:22,319
boss battle game is like, "Oh, damn it."

1795
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,799
>> I guess three of those are examples of

1796
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:26,240
games where like you have to take action

1797
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,680
on an environment, but your action has

1798
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,559
indirect effects,

1799
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,319
>> you know, throughout the environment and

1800
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,359
it's just really annoying figuring out

1801
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,119
how to optimize that.

1802
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:36,960
>> But they are predictable effects. It's

1803
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,319
like every time I rotate this one left,

1804
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,760
that one's going to rotate right.

1805
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,119
I think it's kind of funny how like the

1806
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,319
context has a lot to do with whether

1807
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,520
these puzzles are employed or not

1808
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,119
because like I do enjoy Professor

1809
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:52,799
Leighton quite a bit.

1810
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:56,079
>> Um it's like it's the most uh you know

1811
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,359
arbitrary narrative like justifying that

1812
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,680
there's puzzles in the world but like

1813
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,640
it's just fun like your intentionality

1814
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,839
when playing the game is that you're

1815
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,720
going to be solving puzzles and that has

1816
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:06,720
something as well. like in the middle.

1817
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,559
>> Yeah. The way that also the way that

1818
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,559
that is presented kind of makes it funny

1819
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,160
in math as well, right? So like the

1820
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,760
mafia goons come up to you and say,

1821
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:18,160
"We're going to stop you from coming in

1822
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:21,039
here unless you can solve this puzzle.

1823
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,280
Shouldn't you just shoot me?

1824
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,440
Solve all your problems." No. No. Solve

1825
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,440
this puzzle.

1826
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:33,760
They're making fun of themselves even.

1827
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,079
>> All right. Cool.

1828
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,920
Uh, okay. I'm not sure if we really

1829
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,480
commented on what we liked or didn't

1830
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:44,640
like, but the some things that we came

1831
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:47,119
up that haven't been brought up yet are,

1832
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,760
uh, cryptics, which are kind of a

1833
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:53,520
combination between like crossword and

1834
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:56,480
riddles, uh, riddles, um, comatorial

1835
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:59,200
games as a puzzle genre,

1836
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,440
um, logic puzzles in general, not just

1837
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,920
like typical logic puzzles like that.

1838
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,799
you can have like

1839
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,599
state machines or pseudohoo or any type

1840
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:11,599
of numerical puzzle. We also wanted to

1841
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,200
differentiate that uh a lot of those

1842
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,039
games or some of those games are

1843
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,480
spatially oriented and some aren't

1844
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,799
>> which we thought was an important aspect

1845
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,760
but not necessarily definitive of a

1846
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,359
completely different genre.

1847
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,599
>> I'm not sure if seen escape machine

1848
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:26,720
puzzle actually outside of like computer

1849
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,599
science text. I know some

1850
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,000
>> I really like

1851
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,599
>> I'll have to ask you suspect it's gonna

1852
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,520
be more involved than we have time for.

1853
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,720
>> By by combinatorial puzzles you mean

1854
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,640
stuff like like you have

1855
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,319
>> comtorial games like

1856
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,880
>> all the games that fall under comtorial

1857
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,960
game theory.

1858
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,160
>> Okay theoretically puzzles

1859
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,640
>> like everything.

1860
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,119
>> Cool. That's a lot of games.

1861
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:54,559
>> See we also have exploration. So games

1862
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:58,559
where you have to see everything around

1863
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:02,480
you to know what is available for use.

1864
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:04,559
Now on the the braith in the book they

1865
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,000
talked about exit Zelda.

1866
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,559
>> Okay. and just other so a game like

1867
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,319
situation in game that I didn't like is

1868
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,960
you're playing a game and something

1869
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,680
happens you don't step too fast or

1870
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,839
something

1871
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,839
>> and because of that you get to an

1872
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:22,319
irreversible spot where you don't have

1873
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:24,160
the tools necessary to beat the enemy

1874
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,559
right in front of you but you also are

1875
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,599
trapped and can't go back it happened to

1876
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:32,000
me one time it was a Star Wars night of

1877
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:34,400
the old republic and there's an enemy

1878
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,599
there's an enemy I couldn't go forward

1879
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,760
>> there was the enemy you couldn't go

1880
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:40,160
forward and the door or like there was a

1881
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,640
cliff so you couldn't get back up

1882
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,599
>> and so since I couldn't do anything I

1883
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,720
was forced to just completely go back to

1884
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,880
like the last save.

1885
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,039
>> But is that a puzzle or is that just a

1886
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,000
bug?

1887
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:56,480
>> I mean it was like it's it's the type

1888
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,799
where it's exploration and item is an

1889
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,839
item use. So, you need to get an item to

1890
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:04,240
go ahead and like if you had this item,

1891
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,680
then the enemy that you

1892
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,720
>> I think it was like a rancor or

1893
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,160
something.

1894
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,160
>> You could beat the rancor or at least

1895
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:12,880
put it to sleep and walk by it. But

1896
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:16,000
without it, you had to try and just beat

1897
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,799
it or it would kill you.

1898
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,440
>> Okay.

1899
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,279
>> Yeah.

1900
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,440
>> Okay. So, so it was an item that would

1901
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,679
have made combat easier basically, but

1902
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,279
then it was kind they kind of made made

1903
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,679
it this one way.

1904
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,880
>> It's like Yeah. So, so yeah. So, you see

1905
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,480
a lot of puzzle games where they have

1906
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,159
like easy reset, right? It's like, you

1907
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,520
know, you you you can try start trying

1908
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,040
to solve it and you realize you screw up

1909
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,960
something along the way, you hit reset

1910
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:40,480
and go back right back to the beginning.

1911
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,920
Nice of the public has no easy reset. Uh

1912
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,199
you live with the consequences. I guess

1913
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,759
that's what they were trying to go for.

1914
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:49,520
But,

1915
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:51,520
>> all right. So, we also had a loading of

1916
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,199
sliding puzzles either either with

1917
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,799
numbers or with pictures. Both of them

1918
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,440
are equally annoying.

1919
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:58,080
It's easy.

1920
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,799
>> But but on the other hand, Alec loves

1921
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:02,799
rush hour and and

1922
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,719
>> it's the travel.

1923
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,400
>> You have to slide cars out of the way to

1924
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,239
form a path.

1925
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,920
>> In Professor Leighton, there are an

1926
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:12,480
awful lot of sliding puzzles that have

1927
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,400
like differently shaped pieces or oddly

1928
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,199
shaped pieces,

1929
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,159
>> which is slightly more interesting or

1930
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:21,839
less annoying than sliding puzzles, but

1931
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,679
like regular sliding puzzles, but it's

1932
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,880
still incredibly frustrating. Well, I

1933
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,199
think the difference there is that when

1934
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,480
you have differently sized pieces, like

1935
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,759
when when you're doing just like a

1936
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,520
sliding puzzle where you're trying to

1937
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,040
recreate an image, there's definite

1938
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,159
patterns that you keep using over and

1939
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,319
over again because you're just like

1940
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:37,759
rotating spacesh

1941
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,279
>> um so it's not actually interesting.

1942
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,799
Whereas rush hour, you actually have to

1943
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,199
like think about how things fit

1944
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,400
together. So, one other puzzle type that

1945
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,679
we haven't really mentioned that I

1946
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,159
actually really enjoy is like uh

1947
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,880
pictographic puzzles where it relies on

1948
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:53,120
on sort of your association with visual

1949
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,040
images and like word play and stuff.

1950
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,520
Like for example, you'll have a puzzle

1951
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:01,760
that's just, you know, an image of an

1952
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:05,199
eyeball uh a bumblebee and a screenshot

1953
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,960
of Jiggy Dench in like in a James Bond

1954
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:12,640
movie. And the idea is it's IBM.

1955
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:15,280
So like I I love puzzles like that.

1956
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,880
>> Puzzles.

1957
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,760
>> Yeah. So stuff like that where where it

1958
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,320
relies on on someone like a human being

1959
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,560
actually associating information with

1960
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,400
something visual rather than it being

1961
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,640
just like a straight logic puzzle where

1962
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,159
you have this this you know this

1963
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,280
information and we use this to derive

1964
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:34,080
the rest of the information.

1965
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,679
>> Yeah. Re rebu

1966
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,679
and of course those are very language

1967
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,080
focused even though they're image based.

1968
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:42,320
So, uh, but like the one that has the

1969
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,040
two lines and then read in the middle.

1970
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,239
>> Well, you

1971
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,080
>> Well, things like that. Yeah.

1972
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:47,920
>> Yeah. you have reverbs where you're

1973
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:51,120
trying to like basically reconstruct

1974
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:53,120
something and then um I forget what uh

1975
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:55,760
the what's the classification of puzzles

1976
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,600
where you're given some assembly of

1977
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:03,280
images and you're trying to like you

1978
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:06,640
know um god uh uh if if if I if I wrote

1979
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,400
in what's

1980
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:14,239
this this is not a good puzzle but just

1981
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:17,239
to give an example if I put you know

1982
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:17,239
feels.

1983
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,560
>> Yeah, this is kind of fun. I think there

1984
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,080
is a a specific word for these kind of

1985
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,640
things, but the whole idea they're

1986
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:32,400
trying to reconstruct this reconstruct

1987
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:35,760
sentence from from the so um so um

1988
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:39,120
so uh yeah, I mean the these are they're

1989
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,640
usually spatial to to to to begin with,

1990
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:43,280
but uh I think there was a whole game

1991
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,000
show in the 80s that was just all Yeah,

1992
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,600
that's awesome. That's that's great. Um,

1993
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,840
in Australia they had a triple

1994
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:53,520
catchphrase which was

1995
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:56,320
>> I think catchphrase was the short

1996
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,719
>> so we we wrote a big list of different

1997
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,640
types of puzzles. So we've got let's

1998
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,159
just run through right we got lots of

1999
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,640
different sliding puzzle variants. We've

2000
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:06,159
got hidden object finding. If anyone's

2001
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,679
done the words wallow then it's kind of

2002
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:12,480
a similar deal. Um we have riddles

2003
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,480
various kinds of logic puzzles

2004
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,560
particularly two which we've mentioned

2005
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,320
before somebody who is has several

2006
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,320
people witnesses give statements one of

2007
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:23,440
them's a liar which one's a liar so find

2008
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:25,520
an inconsistent person and there's the

2009
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,440
um thing with property X is next to

2010
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,040
thing with property Y what order are

2011
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:33,080
they sitting in that kind of puzzle

2012
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,080
there's a million of them in professor

2013
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:39,120
there's um these kinds of

2014
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:42,000
um unraveling or reverse engineering

2015
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,679
type puzzles where some system has been

2016
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,560
permuted and you have to restore it to

2017
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,239
its original state of which Rubik's cube

2018
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,520
is like the canonical example I guess

2019
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,760
but then there's a bunch of other

2020
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,800
different work on how chess games can

2021
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:57,840
fit in that can

2022
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:01,040
>> there's like tile rotation and swapping

2023
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,040
puzzles like one example of this is

2024
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,719
hacking but then there are a million

2025
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,320
other variations on exchanging tiles or

2026
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,080
swapping them around or this kind of

2027
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:13,040
thing. Lots of different kinds of math

2028
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:15,120
puzzles. Um, this particular word

2029
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,480
transformation puzzle type that I that I

2030
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,840
used to see all the time when I was a

2031
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:22,640
kid where you by changing one letter of

2032
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:27,360
a word per step, you have to transform

2033
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:29,360
one word into another. Um, mazes,

2034
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,199
jigsaw puzzles,

2035
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:36,000
>> code breaking, nobody even mentioned

2036
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:38,159
yet. Um, and then also these kind of

2037
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,960
thought experimenty type puzzles. I

2038
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,800
don't know how else to categorize them.

2039
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,280
Give us an example.

2040
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,280
>> All right. So,

2041
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:52,640
I'm trying to remember

2042
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:54,560
how this works, but I think it is. Does

2043
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,000
this one This one popped on up on Day

2044
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,000
Nine's podcast the other day. I don't

2045
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,679
want to give it because otherwise

2046
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,400
>> if I get it wrong, then people will go,

2047
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,120
"Oh my god." and try and puzzle it out.

2048
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,719
>> Let me see if I can.

2049
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,679
>> So, it has to do with a piece of string

2050
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,520
and burning.

2051
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,400
>> Oh, the 15 minutes.

2052
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,400
>> Yeah.

2053
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,520
>> Do you remember Do you remember exactly

2054
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,880
how?

2055
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,960
>> Yeah. You okay? You have two pieces of

2056
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,120
string. Uh you know that the whole

2057
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,199
string takes an hour to burn. Uh but

2058
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,280
it's not linear. So like you don't it's

2059
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,920
not linear. Uh you have an infinite

2060
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:27,120
supply of matches. How can you measure

2061
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,480
15 minutes with the strength?

2062
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,159
>> Those are lateral thinking puzzles.

2063
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,280
Yeah, they're all thinking puzzles. I

2064
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,960
guess

2065
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,920
>> I think they're I I would classify this

2066
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,600
under riddles, but we have two identic

2067
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,120
>> identical identical pieces.

2068
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,000
>> They both No, they're identical, but

2069
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,560
they both take an hour.

2070
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,920
>> They don't have to.

2071
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,440
>> They don't have to be, but they both

2072
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,760
take an hour to burn. Nonidently,

2073
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,600
>> couldn't you just be lighting matches

2074
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,280
the entire time and see how many matches

2075
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:56,280
you can burn an hour and after that just

2076
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,280
take that number? No, but like

2077
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,960
>> but then how are you going to measure

2078
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,560
that original hour?

2079
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,560
>> This this assume you want to measure.

2080
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,960
>> But you know that thing takes an hour to

2081
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,520
burn. Yeah,

2082
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,120
>> the whole thing.

2083
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,920
>> It takes slightly longer than the amount

2084
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:11,600
of time.

2085
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,640
Well, we could, but then it would be

2086
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,440
nice to give people time to think about

2087
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:18,920
it, too. So, so

2088
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,920
answer on Wednesday.
