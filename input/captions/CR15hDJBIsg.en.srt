1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,920
I'm delighted to be here to introduce

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,960
the final speaker in our series for the

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,519
Broad MIT uh series in chemical biology.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,080
We've had a fantastic slate of speakers

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,880
uh and a highlight today as well. I want

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,439
to begin by thanking our sponsors from

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,920
industry. You can see them listed here.

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,240
Uh and also of course Ed Skolnick who's

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,119
made the entire program possible uh for

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,240
us. So thank you very much. Uh we really

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,200
appreciate it.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,480
Um our speaker today is Jonathan

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,360
Abraham. Jonathan is uh a really

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,000
fantastic scientist uh in the viology

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,480
and structural biology space. Jonathan

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,160
got his start actually at Harvard

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
University where he earned a bachelor's

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,399
degree in 2005

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
uh and worked with Stephen Harrison

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,600
there uh and actually continued to work

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,079
with Stephen Harrison as he pursued his

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,480
MD PhD earning that in 2012.

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,760
uh following following that he had a

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,200
term as a intern and resident at BWH uh

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,920
and then was a clinical and research

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,400
fellow at Brigham and Women's uh really

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,119
uh doing beautiful structural biology

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,439
and vyology and a bunch of other uh

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,840
great work around immunology uh all

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,960
along the way um Jonathan started as an

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,040
assistant professor at Harvard Med in

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,360
2017 was promoted to associate in 2022

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,000
uh and he has uh also, you know, really

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,520
impressively he's also a practicing

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,799
physician, right? Uh and and so I I

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,439
really admire the ability to do all of

37
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:48,000
that. He's got a long list of awards

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,960
here, all the awards that uh you dream

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
of getting. So he's uh he's won all of

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,920
the different burrows welcome fund

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,119
awards uh from early in the career for

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
uh physician scientist uh up through

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,320
he's currently one of their

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
investigators in the pathogenesis of

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,520
infectious disease. Uh he won the NIH

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,440
director's early independence award, the

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,879
Smith family foundation odyssey award,

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,440
many other awards uh many other awards

49
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,200
here. Um, as I said, his lab is

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,040
interested in molecular viology,

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,440
immunology, structural biology, uh, of

52
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,440
viruses, uh, how they adapt or or how

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,239
they interact with, uh, receptors on

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
host cells, how they're neutralized by

55
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,959
antibodies. He's interested in the viral

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,480
polymerases and how they replicate viral

57
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,239
genomes. And sort of the big picture

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,560
vision here is eventually not just to

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,120
get mechanistic understanding, but also

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,879
find new avenues to treatments uh, and

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
vaccines and things like that. So it's a

62
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,200
very important research area. Uh

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
Jonathan's been extremely uh successful

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,120
and made major contributions throughout.

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,360
You're going to hear about them today.

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,879
Uh and I should mention that as of last

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,599
year uh he's also a HHMI investigator.

68
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,280
Uh which is a fantastic thing to be

69
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,440
especi I think it's always a fantastic

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
thing to be but especially if you're

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
working on infectious disease these

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,360
days. Right. So with that I'll turn it

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,360
over to him.

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
Thank you, Matt, for the wonderful

75
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,920
introduction. I'll jump right

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,400
in. And so here on this, maybe I'll

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,720
stand over here. It might be easier. Um

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,720
on this sort of diagram here, I'm

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,840
showing you a viral particle uh with a

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,360
membrane in gray. And the sort of

81
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
interesting bit we'll focus on today is

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
a viral spike protein shown in blue. And

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
so these spike proteins that decorate

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
the surface of viral particles of course

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
played a critical role of attaching the

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
virus to cellar receptors during the

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,560
first step of the infectious cycle. And

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,840
so after this binding event uh the virus

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,319
can be endocytosed into for the viruses

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,120
we study acidic compartments whereby the

91
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,879
exposure of low pH allows the spike

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
protein to undergo these massive

93
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,720
confirmational changes uh that culminate

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
in fusion of the viral and host cell

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,599
membranes. And so in addition to our

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,439
interest in how viruses can bind

97
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,280
receptors, we also study neutralizing

98
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,480
antibodies that will bind the spike

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,519
proteins and prevent receptor

100
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,040
engagement. And so one of the bigger

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,799
picture questions we hope our research

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,880
will help clarify is how spike proteins

103
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,479
can adapt to bind cell receptors in

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,479
different hosts while also avoiding

105
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,600
immune recognition by molecule like

106
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,280
antibodies. And so alpha virus is the

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
virus I'll tell you about today. Um

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,759
these are subdivided into two groups old

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
world and new world. This is based on

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,160
their cerological properties as well as

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,320
their geographic distribution. Um the

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,560
old world viruses typically cause rash

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,919
and arthritis. An old world alpha virus

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
you might have heard about is chicken

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,960
gona virus while the new world viruses

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
typically cause encphilitis. A sort of

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,479
well-known example in the New England

118
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,160
area is a eastern ecoin and sephilitis

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,479
virus. And so unfortunately for the new

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
world viruses including triple E, there

121
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,880
are no approved vaccines or treatment

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,720
options. And these diseases can be quite

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,479
devastating because some of them for

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,440
example have a case fatality rate that

125
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,520
can be as high as 75%. And for those who

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,400
survive infection, they can be left with

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,919
permanent neurological squelia

128
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,199
thereafter, including many requiring

129
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,800
lifelong institutionalized care. And so

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,000
why we care about these viruses is

131
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
because they have this pretty

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,199
interesting life cycle in nature whereby

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,080
they are amplified in these reservoir

134
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,919
species including mosquito vectors and

135
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,080
birds. Um this is called the end uh the

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,039
enzyatic cycle and the episotic end of

137
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,520
the cycle here which are what some might

138
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,600
call spillover events results in dead

139
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
end infection when mosquito bridge

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,160
vectors feed on vymic berries and then

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,919
spread them to humans or horses. And

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,039
what I mean by dead and hosts is that

143
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,560
humans and horses will sustain uh vymia

144
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,880
that's high enough to say seed the

145
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,199
central nervous system but the vymia is

146
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,000
not uh prolonged enough or high enough

147
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,560
to allow the these hosts to serve as

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,800
fresh sources of virus to then spread to

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,759
new hosts. So uh infection ends in these

150
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
hosts

151
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,280
here and so the spike protein is

152
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,600
synthesized initially as a polyeptide

153
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:23,840
precursor. you have a capsid uh followed

154
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,400
by a chaperone called E3, E2, E1 as well

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,080
as this peptide here called sis 6K that

156
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,800
sits in between and in gray here I'm

157
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,319
showing you the uh viral membrane and so

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,199
really the business end of the particle

159
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,440
is E2 that interacts with receptors and

160
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,120
E1 that underos the confirmational

161
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,400
changes I mentioned will culminate in

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,400
fusion of the vowel and host cell

163
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,800
membranes and so these form heterodimer

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,919
um that assemble then as trimers so

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,039
there's There's a total of about uh 240

166
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,280
E1 E2 heterodimer forming 80 trimers on

167
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,520
the surface of particles and what you

168
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,919
have here is E2 that is most membrane

169
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,639
distal and E1 that sits closest to the

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,440
viral membrane uh caps on the interior

171
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,520
and the lipid billayer is here. So I'm

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,120
showing you a diagram here that doesn't

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,880
really faithfully reproduce how the

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,080
virus is actually organized.

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,919
aosahedral symmetry. And so um as will

176
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,840
be relevant to the other parts of my

177
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,080
presentation, we really wanted to take a

178
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,960
system that would recapitulate this

179
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,840
proper particle geometry as we try to

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,039
find receptors for these viruses.

181
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,759
And so um here I'll tell you about sort

182
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,840
of a landmark study done out of Wu and

183
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,440
Mike Diamond's lab where identified this

184
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,199
molecule called MX RA8 a cellion

185
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,680
molecule as a cell receptor for chicken

186
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,319
goono virus and why this discovery was

187
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
important um is that it allowed us to

188
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,280
for the first time visualize how

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,759
receptors can interact with alpha

190
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,360
viruses. uh before 2018 there was sort

191
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,520
of critical knowledge gaps in the field

192
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,759
and these molecules were unknown and in

193
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,520
2018 really is when the crisper cast 9

194
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,360
screens had been used to find this

195
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,879
molecule and hopefully what you can see

196
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,319
here is I'm showing you the spike

197
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,479
protein E1 subunit in gray E2 subunit in

198
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,319
light blue this is a side view the

199
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
membrane would be down here this is a

200
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,479
top view um hopefully you can see that

201
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,199
this MX8 molecule in pink really hugs a

202
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,759
cleft that is formed by adjacent E2E1

203
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,639
heterodimer on the trimers and so if you

204
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,879
use a system like lentivirus or vicular

205
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
stomatitis virus so particles that don't

206
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,400
have the proper geometry and that are

207
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,880
pleomorphic you might miss uh or or not

208
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,880
form these properly assembled trimers

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,159
and that might not give you as reliable

210
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,360
a result and so with this in mind as we

211
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,880
set out to do our own crisper screens um

212
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,000
back in 2017 we decided to in rather

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,399
than using VSV or lentiviruses is to

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,200
build our own uh repliconbased system

215
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,880
for alpha viruses. And so we took the

216
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
alpha virus genome here that has a

217
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,440
non-structural proteins followed by

218
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,920
capsid and the structural poly protein

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,959
including the spike proteins here and

220
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,959
split it into two. And so plasmid one

221
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,000
here has the non-structural proteins

222
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,560
followed by capsid 2a self-cleing

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,160
peptide followed by a reporter. And so

224
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
this reporter could be green fluorescent

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,959
protein if we wanted to study viral

226
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,519
entry using flowcytometry or microscopy

227
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,200
and it could also be a sort of

228
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
selectable marker we could express on

229
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,440
the surface of infected cells like CD20

230
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,399
a bell marker that I'll tell you about

231
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,000
in the next slides and plasmid 2 in this

232
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
case would allow us to express

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
heterologous spike proteins. So in this

234
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,680
case we could take the spike protein of

235
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,040
eastern ecornin and sephilitis virus and

236
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
because a lot of these viruses are bsl3

237
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,320
pathogens uh and this is a single cycle

238
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
system it allowed us to work with these

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,040
particles under BSL2 conditions in our

240
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
lab

241
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,760
safely and so the way our screen worked

242
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,640
uh is we sort of transduced our library

243
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,839
of guide RNAs into cells. So because we

244
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
were really focused on finding

245
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,160
receptors, we only targeted membrane

246
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,360
proteins in the genome. Um with a total

247
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,600
of 10 guides per membrane protein uh so

248
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,399
with high guide redundancy, we do our

249
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,720
purein selection and rather than using

250
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,519
GFP here as our reporter in the virus,

251
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,680
we have CD20. So Z20 will be expressed

252
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,079
on the surface of cells here. These are

253
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,399
two T cells we're using for our screen.

254
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,079
And uh expression of this B cell marker

255
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,720
would be abnormal. and would allow us to

256
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,160
effectively uh deplete these cells using

257
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,079
rounds of magnetic sorting. Uh and I say

258
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,680
this magnetic sorting is useful because

259
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
rather than spending say eight hours on

260
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,279
a flowcytometer sorting positive and

261
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,120
negative cells with GFP, we could just

262
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,160
do this with max beads inside a tissue

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
culture hood and do this quite

264
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,760
efficiently. And so we do this for

265
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,320
several cycles. Uh three was sort of a

266
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
sweet spot for this virus and uh

267
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
followed by next generation sequencing

268
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,320
to identify guides that are enriched.

269
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
And so really the first screen we did

270
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,519
was a virus called semnikiforest virus.

271
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,240
This is just because it got in really

272
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,680
well into the 293T cells. And when we

273
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,839
used semiik forest virus the top hit was

274
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,720
VLDLR. So VLDLR stands for the very low

275
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,240
density laprotein receptor. Um it is a

276
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
protein that was known to be a receptor

277
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,160
for other viruses including vicular

278
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,120
stomatitis virus and uh certain groups

279
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,200
of human infecting rhino viruses. um

280
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,399
HSP9DB1 is a protein that is a chaperon

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,160
for PCSK9 which is a master regulator of

282
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,720
LDLR related protein. So that was

283
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,320
reassuring and SC3A the role was unclear

284
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,920
when we did the study but it's involved

285
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,800
probably in the stability of these other

286
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,720
proteins here through

287
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,240
glycosillation and so if you look at how

288
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,519
the receptor is organized it has a long

289
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,519
and terminal uh uh sort of lian binding

290
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,760
domain that has what are called LDLR

291
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,760
class A repeats. So each of these

292
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,160
repeats is about 40 amino acids in

293
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,519
length. Um the repeats are imperfect

294
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,600
repeats to each other. So there's a lot

295
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,839
of sequence diversity in the region and

296
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,120
they all tend to coordinate calcium and

297
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,640
the same residues that coordinate

298
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,040
calcium are typically residues that bind

299
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,440
lians and so different family members of

300
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,120
the LDLR related families of proteins

301
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
will have different numbers of these

302
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,360
repeats and repeats of the different

303
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,920
identities in terms of sequence. And so

304
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,079
when we uh found this as a receptor for

305
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,519
semikiforis virus we also wanted to look

306
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,519
if other family members could serve as

307
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,560
receptors for the same virus. And when

308
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,040
we looked at a protein called

309
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,959
apo2 which is a protein that unlike

310
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,320
VLDLR rather than being expressed

311
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,399
throughout the body is particularly

312
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
enriched in the brain and that receptor

313
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,320
also worked as a receptor for subnik

314
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,839
forest virus. I should add as an

315
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,240
interesting point that when we looked at

316
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,240
LDLR the canonical family member that we

317
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
didn't see that uh serve as a receptor

318
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,720
for these viruses and interestingly

319
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,560
enough VLDLR and POR2 um are known as

320
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639
reelin receptors because they bind to a

321
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
molecule called renal reelin in the

322
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,880
central nervous system that's important

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,440
for development um in the brain and then

324
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,880
later on important for uh synaptic

325
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,320
plastic

326
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,920
plasticity and so now you know the

327
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,839
experiments we tend to perform to

328
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,760
validate receptors I won't um go through

329
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,040
the whole list um in terms of showing

330
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,720
you the data but I'll just explain

331
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,399
quickly you know the quickest experiment

332
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
we can do once we have a hit that we're

333
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,959
excited about of course is to take

334
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,079
knockout cells in this case um and show

335
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,959
that complementing them with uh VLDLR

336
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,920
cDNA in this case allows us to rescue

337
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,519
infection this is measured by uh GFP

338
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,279
quantification of infected cells with

339
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
the RVPs

340
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,279
um we could show that cells that are

341
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,079
resistant to infection can become

342
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,279
permissive when we overex express the

343
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:37,200
receptor. Uh we could show that the

344
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,839
antibodies uh directed against the

345
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
receptor can be used to block

346
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,440
infectivity. Um that purified components

347
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,519
interact. Um this is usually by

348
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,519
purifying virus-l like particles and re

349
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,880
combinant receptors and mixing them

350
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,000
together approaches using you know

351
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,480
biollay interferometry or elysas and

352
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,399
then receptor binding mediates uh sorry

353
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,760
receptor itself can mediate binding and

354
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,920
internalization. And usually we use live

355
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,959
stealth coco microscopy but these are

356
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,320
great products for graduate students

357
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,040
because they have a lot of work to do.

358
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Um and in terms of the physiological

359
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
relevance this is perhaps more

360
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,360
challenging for us in that case you have

361
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,240
to sort of have an animal model that you

362
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,680
show um if genetically deficient for

363
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,600
this receptor it becomes resistant to

364
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,000
infection. An approach we use I'll tell

365
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,880
you about later is instead because VLDLR

366
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,839
at the time we're doing these

367
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,440
experiments we thought it was an

368
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,519
essential gene um to development of myo

369
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,839
based on prior literature. what we can

370
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,760
do is effectively take a soluble from

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
the receptor, administer it to the mouse

372
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,440
and show that the receptor can serve as

373
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,800
a decoy um and block infection that way

374
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,639
and this is how we usually demonstrate

375
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,760
physical relevance. So we did this all

376
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,040
for semicorus virus. Uh at the same time

377
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,240
al also we looked at uh eastern

378
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,399
sephilitis virus and saw that vdlr and

379
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,639
apore 2 could also be receptors for this

380
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,959
particular

381
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,560
virus. And so now why we were sort of

382
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,000
excited about this in the beginning is

383
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,959
really the central question we wanted to

384
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,959
better understand is how these arbo

385
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,040
viruses that infect mosquitoes and

386
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,199
humans are able to infect cells from you

387
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,399
know organisms that are separated by

388
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,680
hundreds of millions of years of

389
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,600
evolutionary history. And so VLDLR

390
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,680
interestingly enough is also expressed

391
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,959
in mosquitoes that is called lipopformin

392
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,279
receptor 1. Um and so we set out to

393
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,920
express different orthologes of VLDLR

394
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,160
and different orthologes of APOR2. And

395
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,440
so by uh taking our non-permissive cells

396
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,760
and overexpressing each of these

397
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,959
receptors, we saw that all the receptor

398
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,399
orthologes we tested for VLDLR and APOR2

399
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,639
including bird uh for apo2 and mosquito

400
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,839
for VLDLR could serve as receptors for

401
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,120
septic forest virus. Um Lars Clark, one

402
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,560
of the students working on the project,

403
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,199
I challenged him to find a good negative

404
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,199
control. He tried C elegance which also

405
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,120
has a VLDL ortholog that's important for

406
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,320
lipid uptick in the guts. I'm not

407
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
showing you this but the C elegance

408
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,480
ortholog also worked. So we never really

409
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,560
had a negative control for this uh

410
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
particular assay given the promiscuity

411
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,519
with which sim link forest virus seem to

412
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,000
be interacting with um these receptors

413
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,560
where we looked at uh each sephilitis

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,120
virus. However, we actually saw that uh

415
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,920
it could bind VLDL orthox for some PCs

416
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,360
but not others. Um so to us that was

417
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
sort of the first sign perhaps that even

418
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,920
though Sam licky forest virus and

419
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,480
eastern equin were using both VLDLR and

420
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
a year 2 as receptors that the viruses

421
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,639
might have differences in which uh with

422
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,079
which they interact with these receptors

423
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,959
which you know as a structural biology

424
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,399
lab is sort of um inspires us to go to

425
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,519
the next step which is to determine

426
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,440
cryoreem structures of the

427
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,120
complexes. And so whenever we take on a

428
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,800
structural project, we want to first map

429
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
what might be the minimal receptor

430
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,120
binding fragment to complex with our

431
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,519
virus-like particles for the either

432
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,600
X-ray or um crym experiments. And so the

433
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,240
approach we used here was we took

434
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,839
individual LDLR class A repeats and put

435
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,160
them on the scaffold of the rest of the

436
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
receptor and then overexpress these to

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,920
figure out what might be the minimal

438
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,480
receptor binding fragment. Now our

439
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
hypothesis going in was that perhaps you

440
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,240
know this is flexible. Maybe the most

441
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,240
membrane distal repeat would work as a

442
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,240
as a receptor for these viruses. So

443
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,520
maybe this construct might work. But

444
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,919
when we did the experiments actually we

445
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,760
saw that multiple of these LA repeats um

446
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,600
LA 2 three four five sorry LA 2 three

447
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,839
five and six could serve as receptors

448
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,480
for the key4 virus when overexpressed.

449
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,440
So rather than engaging an individual LA

450
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,360
repeat um multiple LA repeats could be

451
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
engaged. This also taught us that

452
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
perhaps there's something unique about

453
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,080
the sequences of each of these repeats

454
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,280
that makes some work versus not as

455
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,960
receptors. And when we looked at eastern

456
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
ecoin and compared it to sim leaky

457
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,000
forest virus, we saw that eastern ecoin

458
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,760
could actually bind LA1 in addition to

459
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,480
binding the other LA I mentioned. So

460
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,799
again a different uh set of data

461
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
demonstrating that perhaps eastern ecoin

462
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,360
and semic forest virus uh had

463
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
differences in their spike that um allow

464
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,320
them to sort of engage these receptors

465
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,960
differently.

466
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,440
So on to cryomm structures. Um I should

467
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,960
mention that uh for the students um in

468
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,039
the lab it's also very stressful because

469
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,280
whenever we find a receptor and publish

470
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,880
on it there's like multiple labs that

471
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
work very quickly to get the cryogam

472
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
structures and so there was multiple

473
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
structures reported over the time frame

474
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,120
we did this work but so we did

475
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,039
structures of sikiiforis virus and

476
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,440
eastern equinitis virus bound to the

477
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,120
receptor here I'm showing you a top down

478
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,240
view. So the membrane would be like in

479
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,400
the back of the sort of screen here and

480
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,320
we would be facing the virus. There's

481
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,640
the E1 subunit in uh in gray, E2 subunit

482
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,880
in light blue and the E3 chaperone that

483
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,760
was retained on our preparations.

484
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,400
And so when we looked at binding of the

485
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,080
LA repeats for San Niki forest virus,

486
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,480
rather than being in this cleft that I

487
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,160
mentioned where MX8 binds for chicken

488
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,720
virus, it was actually at a site that

489
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,640
was distal here about 40 angstros away

490
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,559
on E1 um domain 3 here. And it was so

491
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,000
you know kind of like unexpected that

492
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,520
the first time we got the cryomm

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
structure, we actually missed that there

494
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,679
was density there. So it took us se

495
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,679
several runs to be able to actually kind

496
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,000
of go back um and and verify that here

497
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,679
for eastern ecoin it was the canonical

498
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,400
site which is again is involving cliffs

499
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,679
formed by adjacent prote. So that one

500
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,600
was sort of more straightforward to

501
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,280
obtain. And so now if you can zoom into

502
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,919
these structures and look to see how the

503
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,760
receptors interacting with the viral

504
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:33,120
glyoprotein. This is the E1 subunit of

505
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,679
Sam Nikki Forest virus. This is LA2

506
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,440
repeat of

507
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,960
VLDLR. Here you have the calcium ion

508
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,360
that's being coordinated by these acidic

509
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,720
residues and effectively two lysen that

510
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,799
are conserved with some leaky forest

511
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,200
virus but absent an eastern sephilitis

512
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,880
virus that are interacting with the side

513
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,360
chains of these acidic residues here on

514
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,919
the receptor. So this binding mode is

515
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,840
engaging a conserved feature of the

516
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,960
receptor because these residues are

517
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,720
usually involved in calcium

518
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,240
coordination.

519
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,400
Now if you look at eastern ecoin and

520
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,640
sephilitis virus again 40 anctions away

521
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,840
on the spike you see a different site

522
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,760
now involving E2 shown in blue whereby

523
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,280
you have a cluster of basic residues

524
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,200
again interacting with the acidic

525
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
residues on the receptor. Um I should

526
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,039
mention that we also did experiments to

527
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,039
show that if you use EDTA um that

528
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,520
disrupts the interaction presumably

529
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,640
because it changes the geometry of the

530
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,320
site here when you get rid of the

531
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,320
calcium and perhaps partially unfolds

532
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,440
the protein.

533
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,760
Now if you look at how same leaky forest

534
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,400
virus binds the VLDLR the LA repeats at

535
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,559
the bottom here E1 submitted at top it's

536
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,320
very similar to how LDLR interacts with

537
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,919
one of its physiological lag ends or

538
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,120
receptor associated protein. So

539
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
typically what you have is you have

540
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,400
multiple of these repeats of wrap in

541
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,559
this case because it also is

542
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,320
multimodular that present lysen that

543
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:59,039
interact with these acidic residues. And

544
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,200
if you look at rein um if you look at um

545
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,799
uh lipoproteins as well these sort of

546
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,400
basic residue interactions are quite

547
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,400
preserved. So really the virus is

548
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,760
mimicking in a way the physiological uh

549
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,360
lian for these uh receptors and so

550
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,080
summary for the first part I've showed

551
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,600
you that VLDLR and apore2 are cell

552
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,559
receptors for semic forest virus and

553
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,080
eastern sephilitis virus that divergent

554
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,240
receptor orthologics can support alpha

555
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,159
virus entry and that viral spike

556
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,679
proteins can bind sites on um the spike

557
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,799
protein sorry viral spike proteins can

558
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,440
bind the receptors um using different

559
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:37,360
surfaces um that are effectively

560
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,280
um areas where lysines can serve as the

561
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,360
critical night this for interactions.

562
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,520
And so now switching to the next part um

563
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,600
which is I think where the project got

564
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
even more exciting for us. Uh we were

565
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,039
particularly interested about a virus

566
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,240
called western ecoinphilitis virus. So

567
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,159
most of you in the room probably haven't

568
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,039
heard about this virus and you probably

569
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,360
have heard of triple E. So triple E has

570
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,480
you know been around for over a century

571
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,120
now causing episodic outbreaks of vowel

572
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,640
and sephilitis anywhere from no cases to

573
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,400
about a dozen or twoa uh dozens of cases

574
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,000
uh per year. I think the largest

575
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,880
outbreak in the last 50 years was in

576
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,760
2019. There were a total I think of 32

577
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,440
cases in seven states and several

578
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,039
deaths. Western ecoinphilitis virus is

579
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,919
something quite different. So it used to

580
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,559
cause explosive outbreaks of encphilitis

581
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,320
in humans and horses dating back to the

582
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,480
early uh 1900s. Um outbreaks involving

583
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,720
thousands of horses, hundreds of human

584
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,679
cases. Uh but the virus has kind of gone

585
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,919
extinct or submerged in North America.

586
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,200
Um the last outbreak really was or last

587
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,640
case was in 1999 and the virus has kind

588
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
of disappeared since that time. Even

589
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,600
though you know when I'm in the hospital

590
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,240
when we order cerologic testing for um

591
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,320
uh suspected orbital sephilitis we still

592
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,480
check cor p corology this virus has not

593
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,400
caused a case for over um 20 years now

594
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,679
and so we were interested in better

595
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,520
understanding what was going on with

596
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,280
this virus and so I've showed you that

597
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,679
eastern uses

598
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,000
VLDLR2 I should add that Venezuelan

599
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,520
sephilitis virus another member of this

600
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
family was shown to bind a molecule

601
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,000
called LDL LRD3. So this is almost like

602
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,520
a mutation construct we would have

603
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,080
generated. If you delete these domains,

604
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,559
the receptor still works. So LDLRD3 has

605
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,760
three of these LDLR class A repeats and

606
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,400
LA1 is what binds to Venezuelan ecoin

607
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,400
and sephilitis virus. But the receptors

608
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,720
for western ecoin and sephilitis virus

609
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,240
was not known. And so at the time uh we

610
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,559
were working on Sam Leiki, we also had

611
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
done a screen for western ecoin and

612
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,520
sephilitis virus. And rather than

613
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,000
landing a LDLR related molecule, the top

614
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,360
hit was protocadin 10. Um this is a

615
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
protocader that's expressed throughout

616
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,320
the body. It's enriched in neurons where

617
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,240
it um helps synapse uh communicate with

618
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,480
each other by forming these homophilic

619
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,640
dimers in trans. And interestingly

620
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,960
enough, you know, this was the first

621
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,720
bonafide alpha virus receptor that was

622
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,799
not an LDLR related protein but actually

623
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,320
a protocader instead. And so what you

624
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:11,360
have here are these cader repeats here.

625
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,480
And so um taking a step back now looking

626
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,039
at evolution of this virus. Luckily

627
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:20,159
enough there information for strains all

628
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,880
the way from the 1930s to 2005. Um these

629
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,880
are f phyologically described as

630
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,159
lineages A B1 B2 or B3. Um,

631
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,559
interestingly enough, if you look at

632
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
these strains over time in infectivity

633
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,679
studies in mice, the strains from the

634
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,880
30s and 40s are hypervolent, but the

635
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,679
strains from uh 2005 are virtually non-

636
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,159
pathogenic in animal models. And the

637
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,000
crisper screen we did actually uh was

638
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,159
focusing on a 1971 strain from Montana.

639
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,760
Uh we had not gone back in time and look

640
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,080
at older strains or looked at more

641
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,039
recent strains. And so the student

642
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,919
working on the project, Wanu, decided to

643
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,679
test these various strains um again in

644
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,520
groups A through uh B1, B2 and B3. And

645
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,159
I'm showing you here in pink instances

646
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,360
whereby the receptors works versus does

647
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,200
not work as a receptor when

648
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,919
overexpressed in cells. And

649
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,559
interestingly enough um when we uh

650
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,320
looked here we saw that human protocader

651
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,440
10 could be a receptor for all strains

652
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,679
we tested but not for the 2005 strains

653
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,799
that are non

654
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,120
pathogenic. This was the case also for

655
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,279
mouse PCDHN. This was the case for horse

656
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,279
PCDHN. So any mamleian orthologue we

657
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,520
looked at could no longer serve as a

658
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,640
receptor for these viruses. So that we

659
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,080
were sort of scratching our heads and

660
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,320
asking ourselves, you know, what could

661
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,919
this virus be using to get into cells

662
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,799
because we know it can infect certain

663
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,799
cell types. Uh when we looked at the

664
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,880
bird orthologue, we actually saw that

665
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,919
that one could serve as a receptor. So

666
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,360
that sort of solved this piece of the

667
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,360
puzzle. But this didn't really start to

668
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,159
tell us, you know, why the strains from

669
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,840
the 30s and 40s were hypervolent. I

670
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,360
didn't mention this but eastern equin

671
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,000
and sephilitis virus is maybe the most

672
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,799
virilent member of all uh you know new

673
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,320
world alpha viruses and some of the old

674
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,480
strains are kind of reminiscent of the

675
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,240
virolence of eastern ecoin. So when we

676
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,640
looked at receptor usage we found that

677
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,120
the old strains of western ecoin use the

678
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,400
same receptors as well as eastern ecoin

679
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,960
in this case. So in addition to binding

680
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,840
to protein 10 they could bind to VLDLR

681
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,080
and A4 R2 and this property was lost by

682
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,960
newer

683
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,640
strains and so

684
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,760
um that of course led us to do

685
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,440
structures of receptor balm complexes.

686
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,960
In this case I'm showing you again semi

687
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,520
key forest virus. The first structure we

688
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,480
went for is the VLDLR binding mode.

689
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,760
Again it binds to E1 for semi key

690
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,200
eastern equin um it binds the cleft. We

691
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,039
knew this time to look everywhere on the

692
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
spike for binding sites given that we

693
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,520
expected differences. Um the bounding

694
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,520
site is similar uh effectively involving

695
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,679
the clefts for western ecoin for the

696
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,159
ancestral strain. But when you look at

697
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,960
these side views here again with E1 in

698
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,600
gray and E2 in blue, you can see that

699
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,679
rather than binding to one LA repeat,

700
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,080
there's two LA repeats that are bound

701
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,600
kind of wrapping around the opposite pro

702
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,000
in this case. So this binding mode

703
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,200
involves engagement of uh protomer one

704
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,120
here. This binding mode involves

705
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,400
engagement of prote 2 with two of these

706
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,520
LA repeats bound. So again evidence of

707
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,440
structural plasticity and how these

708
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,600
viruses are interacting with receptors.

709
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,600
And just to kind of clarify as well, the

710
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,279
key here is that you have these clusters

711
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,320
of basic residues that are not conserved

712
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,480
in the different viruses that are

713
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,640
hopping around. So clusters of basic

714
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,120
residues here versus here versus here

715
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,760
and here um that are influencing the

716
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,480
ability to recruit LDLR uh repeats in

717
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,000
the binding mode. And so we also wanted

718
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,799
to better understand what was going on

719
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,240
with protein 10 binding. You know why

720
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,880
certain strains were able to bind to

721
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,279
human receptor versus um only being able

722
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,240
to bind the aven form. And so we

723
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,279
obtained structures of PCDH10 bound to

724
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,480
E1 E2 for both ancestral strains as well

725
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,720
as the 2005 Imperial County strain

726
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,120
Imperial 181 um group B3. And so here

727
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,200
I'm showing you sequence alignments.

728
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,559
Sort of what jump jumped out at us was

729
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,679
effectively that at uh leucine 149 in

730
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,320
the spike protein in 2005 you get

731
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,799
replacement of that non-polar residue

732
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,240
with a polar residue of glutamine. Um

733
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,600
and effectively this was at an

734
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,159
interface. So by getting structures of

735
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,880
first the this is a strain from the 50s

736
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,679
bound to human PCDH10. We could see the

737
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,480
PCD here in orange, the receptor in

738
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,399
light blue, that this hydrophobic

739
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,080
residue was forming nice hydrophobic

740
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,880
interactions in this case with

741
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,760
protocaderin 10. Um, but that this

742
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,880
residue became a glutamine in Imperial

743
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,279
181 disrupting these non uh these

744
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,320
non-polar contacts in this case. So you

745
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,039
might ask, you know, how does imperial

746
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,120
181 still bind 10? I'm not showing you

747
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,279
this here, but it's because this strain

748
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,840
in particular has E2 polymorphisms

749
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,200
elsewhere at the interface that

750
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,080
compensate for these contacts. And we

751
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,760
found out that you need about four

752
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,120
mutations on the E2 protein to

753
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,880
compensate for this loss of uh non-polar

754
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,440
contacts in this case. So this is really

755
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,240
sort of a barrier that prevents imper

756
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,080
181 from being able to recognize human

757
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,360
PCDHM despite its ability to interact

758
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,159
with the aven form of the receptor.

759
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,559
And so um we also wanted to better

760
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:37,200
understand what extent of mutations in

761
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,279
the spike again will allow the spike now

762
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,039
to bind to protein 10 or to VLDLR. If

763
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,000
you look at the spike from the Imperial

764
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,600
181 strain and so by examining the cryom

765
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,320
structures together, we basically found

766
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,840
that imperial 181 while it doesn't bind

767
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,440
human horse or uh but binds bird PCH10,

768
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:01,799
it is about one mutation away from being

769
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,799
able to bind to uh the human and horse

770
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:08,640
receptors and uh with two mutations is

771
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:12,240
able to bind to uh imp is able to bind

772
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,360
to all three receptors effectively.

773
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,440
And so now uh how is this information

774
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,240
important? I would say it also can help

775
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
us design potential

776
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,399
antivirals. Uh so what we can do is I

777
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,840
mentioned to you these receptor decor

778
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:29,360
proteins. So we can take in this case

779
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,880
the EC1 repeat of PCDH10. These

780
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,480
structures show that PCDH10 and VLDLRA

781
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,279
repeats bind an overlapping site in the

782
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,039
cleft. So protein 10 EC1 should block

783
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,039
access to both receptors. And we

784
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,200
confirmed this in vitro. So if you take

785
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,880
this molecule and you give it to mice uh

786
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,640
that are challenged with lethal doses of

787
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,880
the ancestral strain that binds all

788
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,039
receptors, you can see in this case that

789
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,799
mice are uh 100% of mice treated with

790
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,279
the product 10 EC1 FC molecule um are

791
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,159
actually protected from infection as

792
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,399
compared to isotope PBS controls.

793
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,200
And if you do a similar experiment and

794
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,080
now you put LA1 and LA2 you block access

795
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,679
to PCDH10 and again we saw significant

796
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,200
protection in mice given this VLDLR LA1

797
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,080
LA2 FC fusion

798
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,240
proteins and so ultimately what we

799
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,919
wanted to have is also a road map a

800
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,600
molecular blueprint to understand what

801
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,919
polymorphisms and the spike protein mean

802
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,840
in terms of viral evolution. Um a lot of

803
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,080
this work we were doing while we were

804
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,000
looking at the virus in North America

805
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,840
again that kind of went extinct and

806
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,039
submerged. And when we looked at the

807
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,080
sequences we saw that you know as I

808
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,000
mentioned here uh these ancestral

809
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,519
strains have these polymorphisms and

810
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,320
basic residues here

811
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:50,960
E1K E181K that allow binding to LDLR

812
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,640
class A repeats. And then this lucine at

813
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,559
149 up until 2005 allows these strains

814
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,480
to bind to uh human and uh horse BCDHM

815
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,919
but this ability is lost here. And then

816
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,279
as we were writing up the paper

817
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,840
unfortunately there was a big outbreak

818
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,720
of weave in South America. Um this was

819
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:13,120
2023 20 uh 2023 to 2024 involving uh

820
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,880
Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. There

821
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,519
were over 200 cases in horses, over 200

822
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,200
human cases. And so we sort of eagerly

823
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,679
waiting for the sequences based on what

824
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,279
we knew here for these polymorphisms.

825
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,720
And when these sequences were released

826
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,000
here, we could see that all of these

827
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,279
viruses had the L149 polymorphism. And

828
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,720
interestingly enough, unlike what

829
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,440
happened in North America where the

830
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,799
virus kind of submerged by having this

831
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,880
L149 Q polymorphism, all the strains we

832
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,000
looked at in South America dating back

833
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,080
to the 30s to 2023 now with the freshest

834
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,799
outbreak have this lucine there and are

835
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,120
able to bind to both uh human and ecoin

836
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,960
forms of protein 10. They did not have

837
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,240
the signature polymorphis binding to

838
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,440
VLDL or LA repeats though

839
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,279
thankfully. And so I've showed you that

840
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,399
weave binds protocader 10 as receptor

841
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,080
mallelian cells that ancestral strains

842
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,760
also had the ability to bind

843
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,200
VLDLR2 and that with the cryomm

844
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,200
structures in hand now we can better

845
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,559
understand how polymorphisms influence

846
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,519
uh receptor dependencies for these

847
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,799
enpholytic alpha viruses. And so on that

848
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,600
note I'd like to thank members of my

849
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,600
lab. Um Juan Yu Lee was a graduate

850
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,679
student who did a lot of the work on

851
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,640
eastern ecoin and western ecoin in terms

852
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,440
of functional assays. Pyang and Shiaoi

853
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,000
Fan are post-doal fellows who did uh the

854
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,080
cryoem work. Um I should mention this is

855
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,919
very sort

856
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,760
of a field that moves really fast. So

857
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,360
many of the lab members here all worked

858
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,519
collectively together to get the data

859
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,519
out very quickly. Um and various

860
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,279
collaborators in particular Scott Weaver

861
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,200
at UTMB

862
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,440
uh who runs the world reference center

863
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,519
for emerging viruses and arboral viruses

864
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,679
that did all of our BSL3 work and then

865
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,940
various sources of funding. And that I'm

866
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,840
happy to take

867
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:04,720
[Applause]

868
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,720
questions. All right. Thank you very

869
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,879
much. That was great. Questions from the

870
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,359
audience. Come up to the microphones to

871
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,359
ask your questions.

872
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,240
All right, I'll use this one. Okay, so

873
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,200
you had some data where with some where

874
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,679
you had like all eight that you had an

875
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,200
effect and then sometimes like one by

876
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,200
itself didn't do much but two and four

877
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,040
did or something like that. From looking

878
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,359
at the structures, can you understand

879
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:01,040
why um some some of them have the effect

880
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,880
and then some of them don't have and and

881
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,880
if that makes sense. Yes. Let me see if

882
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
I have a sequence alignment maybe. Ah I

883
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,320
take a sequence alignment out. Sorry. So

884
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,280
yes, so we did a lot of sequence

885
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,040
alignment uh sort of gazing. Um I think

886
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,160
one of the key requirements is that you

887
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,400
do need to have that uh tryptophan there

888
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,359
for many of the viruses.

889
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,520
Um let me see if I can find

890
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:28,240
here. So this in all the binding

891
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,160
modes this tryptophan in the LA repeat

892
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,480
stacks against the alifhatic portion of

893
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,200
this lysine here and so that's a

894
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,800
critical requirement. Um for eastern

895
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,119
equin you could have a phenol alanine

896
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,920
here in some leaky you can't because of

897
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,680
this extra you know polar interactions

898
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,280
between this aspartate here. So we did

899
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,440
that sort of like staring at alignment

900
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,520
so we get a sense. So whenever this

901
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,000
residue is not conserved there's issues

902
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,720
and for LDL3 the molecule that's a

903
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,880
receptor for Venezuelan ecoin this

904
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,560
residue here um whose backbone

905
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,400
participates in calcium coordination but

906
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,800
not the side chain is replaced by a

907
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,800
lucine and that lucine prevents these

908
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,480
contacts. So we're finally understanding

909
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,960
you know the sort of structure function

910
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,480
sequence basis for how these things work

911
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,079
and they don't work in certain

912
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,440
scenarios.

913
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,920
Thanks for the great talk. Uh so I think

914
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,119
you mentioned briefly about the

915
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,800
glycosillations but I wonder like I know

916
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,920
that like for SARS COVID like

917
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,079
glycosillation of the spike proteins

918
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,400
actually enhance the internalizations of

919
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,119
the viral virus into the human cells.

920
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,520
Yeah. So I wonder like have you looked

921
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,599
at how the

922
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,240
glycosillations impact this affinity

923
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,240
like this binding to receptor and if so

924
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,160
what's a like a molecular mechanism if

925
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,119
there's any different receptor involved

926
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,280
in that pathway or if it's yeah how

927
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,520
what's a molecular mechanism of

928
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,200
increased binding affinity. Oh that's a

929
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,800
very good question. Um I sort of

930
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,119
neglected to mention glycans. I mean

931
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,560
there's some glycans not as heavily

932
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,640
decorated with glycans as SARS KV2 or

933
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,400
other viruses that have like different

934
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,160
architectures in the spike. These

935
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,119
viruses that have you know sort of

936
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,480
icosahhedral symmetry tend to have I

937
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,200
would say like a surface that's more

938
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,520
similar to non-envelope viruses. And so

939
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,960
for flavy viruses we know that glycans

940
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,680
there which are kind of have a similar

941
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,359
shell in general um they bind to DC sign

942
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,640
and that can participate in infection.

943
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,920
For alpha viruses that's really

944
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,040
underexplored. I'm not sure if people

945
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,680
have looked at carefully but that's a

946
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,960
great question. Um I should say that E3

947
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,720
though the chaperon we uh that we we saw

948
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,839
in our preparations other groups that

949
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,160
had structures did not have E3 and there

950
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,599
they saw additional LA repeats bind when

951
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,359
E3 was gone. So I think both glycans as

952
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,240
well as whether or not the chaperone

953
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,359
remains might influence um receptor

954
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,960
binding affinities and those are

955
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,640
important questions for vaccine design

956
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,400
as well because you want to sort of

957
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,400
expose what's relevant when you make a

958
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,400
vaccine.

959
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Uh can you use part of the receptor to

960
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,640
treat the disease to keep it from

961
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,560
binding from the endogenous receptor or

962
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,640
that's not practical because it's a

963
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,160
brain infection. Right. So, uh, you

964
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,599
know, one of these experiments here, and

965
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,760
I'll just jump to it because it's easier

966
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,200
to

967
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,400
show what people have done, and I'll

968
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,599
tell you what people have done and why

969
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,800
it's sort of like tricky to use in the

970
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,960
clinic, is make these types of molecules

971
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,280
here where you

972
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,520
take the repeat that binds to the virus

973
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,680
and you put it on the IGG1 FC constant

974
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,079
region. So, you can give this, you know,

975
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,160
six hours before viral viral challenge.

976
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,800
You can give this up to I think 24 hours

977
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,640
postviral challenge and prevent seeding

978
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,400
of the central nervous system. The

979
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,560
problem though is if you wait too long

980
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,560
the animals become vymic. The virus sees

981
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,079
the brain and it's too late. And I think

982
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,680
of the patients I might see for example

983
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,400
in the hospital in many cases they're

984
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,119
coming in you know a week later after

985
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,119
having their initial fever and vymia you

986
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,119
know their chromatos in the ICU send the

987
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,359
corology takes you about a week to get

988
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,560
the result back and so by then it's too

989
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,280
late. So these are probably better

990
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,280
prophylactic agents and I think in order

991
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,040
to use them as antivirals we need to

992
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,520
have better diagnostics where you

993
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,560
diagnose things very early on and then

994
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,599
you treat um sort of early um otherwise

995
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,960
you have to figure out how to engineer

996
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,720
these to get but it's it's hard to know

997
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,920
because I think later on as mentioned

998
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,160
those same patients will have positive

999
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,160
corology but negative RNA on the PCR

1000
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,839
from the cerable spinal fluid which

1001
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,200
tells you it's more likely an immune

1002
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,320
reaction at this point the virus has

1003
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,599
been cleared. So there a lot of

1004
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,359
challenges of yingling this out as

1005
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,560
therapeutics and this is more really to

1006
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,560
get at the point of physiological

1007
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,560
relevance.

1008
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,320
So I have a question about the about the

1009
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,200
WEV. So you have this substitution was

1010
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,760
it L149Q that cost it the ability to

1011
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,720
interact with the protocod 10. So what's

1012
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,960
the I guess what I was wondering and I

1013
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,920
apologize if I missed it but is what's

1014
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,839
the benefit to the virus for that amino

1015
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,240
acid substitution to have taken over the

1016
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,720
population as the virus submerged I

1017
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,320
guess right I mean it must what's going

1018
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,960
on there so our hypothesis that is

1019
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,560
genetic drift um I didn't mention this

1020
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,800
but there's yet another receptor for

1021
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,200
western equin um called

1022
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,359
MXR8 of the aven species so the so

1023
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,880
chicken ga uses human mx XR8 but not

1024
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,880
avian MXR8 and then uh western ecoin can

1025
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,720
use the aven form of MXR8 but not the

1026
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,839
human form and what happens that that

1027
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,440
mutation is not at the interface with

1028
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:33,359
MXR8 so that mutation is tolerated fine

1029
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,280
so our going hypothesis that perhaps it

1030
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,119
was genetic drift not necessarily an

1031
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,640
advantage but the virus lost the ability

1032
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,480
to bind to protein 10 but as sort of a

1033
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,440
safeguard could still get into aven

1034
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,960
cells using a MXR8 now another

1035
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,400
hypothesis that's not popular in the

1036
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,920
field is that in you know one of

1037
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,160
challenges with what's going on in South

1038
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,920
America with the recent outbreak is that

1039
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,880
you know most likely there was to some

1040
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,839
extent amplification in horses that were

1041
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,800
not getting vaccinated um with horses

1042
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,520
being more prevalent there in sort of

1043
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,359
agriculture and so one other model would

1044
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,359
be perhaps that there's an advantage to

1045
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,599
having a loosen there to be amplified in

1046
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,200
in horses not as dead end host but as

1047
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,560
amplifying host and that's what's

1048
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,800
keeping the virus in circulation South

1049
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,640
America they vaccinated all the horses

1050
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,880
and then now we has not come back for a

1051
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,400
second season and so it's hard to know

1052
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,880
in North America the horses always get

1053
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,880
vaccinated for western eastern and

1054
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:33,280
Venezuelan a great talk um I'm curious

1055
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:38,240
to know so you mentioned um your work

1056
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,400
with horses and bird um is there

1057
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,800
additional value from learning from

1058
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,400
other species um or is it like

1059
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,680
diminishing returns or could you speak

1060
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,240
more to like any plans about

1061
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,400
diversifying the host post or dead end

1062
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,400
species? That's a great question. I'm

1063
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,599
sorry I should add that part um to the

1064
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,839
talk. So, as I was reading more about

1065
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,160
this, I found papers from the 50s

1066
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,359
describing how western equin was thought

1067
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,000
to have as an additional enzyatic host,

1068
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,760
garter snakes, which you know are sort

1069
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,640
of the same snakes I saw growing up in

1070
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,760
my backyard in Canada. Um, and I'm

1071
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,920
assuming they're sort of prevalent

1072
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,640
throughout. The idea is that birds are

1073
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,400
actually not vymic long enough to be

1074
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,480
able to say carry the virus from South

1075
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,079
America to North America. But snakes

1076
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,240
during the winter can be chronically

1077
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,040
infected with little consequence. And so

1078
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,400
they're thought to be these

1079
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,040
overwintering hosts. So in addition to

1080
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,599
western equin being able to use aven

1081
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,280
PCDH10, it's able to use snake PCH10 as

1082
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,960
well. Um and so there sort of an extra

1083
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,480
layer as well. That being said, people

1084
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,240
are not looking aggressively in snakes

1085
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,480
to see if the virus is still there. But

1086
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,800
the same mutation, this L149Q is

1087
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,359
tolerated by the snake ortholog as well.

1088
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Uh we have not looked beyond snakes. Um

1089
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,400
but based on sequence, I'm suspecting

1090
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
additional might work like amphibious

1091
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,480
like I was asking the student war. He

1092
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,040
was like, "So how are the snakes getting

1093
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,960
like how the mosquitoes getting the

1094
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,160
virus from snakes? Apparently they bite

1095
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,800
the eye." And I was like, "Okay, let's

1096
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,800
stop talking about it."

1097
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,520
Any other questions? More questions.

1098
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,800
Going

1099
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,280
once. All right. Let's thank Jonathan

1100
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,280
for a great talk.

1101
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,590
[Applause]
