1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Good morning everybody. It's great to be

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,759
here with you. Uh I'm Michael Carney.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,240
I'm uh general partner at the Engine

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,560
Ventures. I'm gonna I'm gonna pivot the

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,080
conversation away from the application

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,800
layer of AI that Paul just talked about,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,439
I think, very eloquently and excitingly

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,039
into how AI is a real forcing function

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
for basically everything happening in

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,800
the broader economy around the

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,280
translation of breakthrough science and

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,880
engineering that I think about. Um, I'll

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,200
start and it's great to see many

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,520
familiar faces and I've talked through

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,239
the story of the engine with many of you

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,520
in the past. Um but I'm just take you

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,200
back uh to remind you all 15 10 years

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,800
ago in 2015 um the the venture landscape

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,920
for translation of breakthrough science

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,360
was very different. um and things,

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,680
ideas, inventions were sitting on the

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,079
shelves in labs, not translating from

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,360
the academic realm into the commercial

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,680
realm. And Raphael Rafe, the president

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,200
of MIT at the time, wanted to do

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,119
something about that because MIT's

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,119
mission is ultimately one of global

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,200
impact. Uh and so he set out uh to solve

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,080
that problem. That problem was well

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,479
articulated in a in a paper out of the

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,759
MIT energy initiative around venture

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,360
capital and clean techch but it had

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,759
broader implications across deep tech

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,920
altogether making the case that venture

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,000
capital was not the right instrument for

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,720
for bringing these technologies out of

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,360
the lab. Um I think interestingly and

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm friends with Ben and Verun uh and

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,159
Libby who were on that paper and Frank

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,720
um all of whom now work in venture

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
capital or incle techch startups uh who

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,439
have been venture venture funded. So the

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,119
the world has truly changed from that

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,840
moment. Um Raphael set up the engine as

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,680
an institution to solve some of the

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,840
frictions in that translation story. Um

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,560
the engine came was born out of the

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,200
president's office at at MIT as an

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,280
institution with multiple parts. The

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,120
first part was a venture capital fund

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
with the mandate to fund breakthrough

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
science and engineering but with the

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,400
understanding that things that would

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,640
change the world and ultimately be um

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
pillars of of the economy would take a

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,040
little bit longer than some of the

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,080
softwarebacked startups um that have had

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,959
emerged in in the ecosystem. uh and that

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,280
patient capital was necessary early on

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
to help those companies get to scale.

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,319
The second element of it was an infra in

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,760
infrastructure. So uh and we have the

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,560
engine ventures and we have the engine

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,040
accelerator down the road 750 Main

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,680
Street. We have a home for startups that

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,239
are working on deep tech. uh 300,000

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,080
square feet of space uh for for

68
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,280
companies that are doing life science,

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,959
chemistry, clean tech, robotics uh and

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,640
and AI underlying all of that uh to go

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
and live in the early days of company

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
formation with the goal of accelerating

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
the pace of experimentation. And then

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,959
across those two implementations, the

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,519
venture fund and the infrastructure,

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,840
there's a set of programming to help

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,239
early entrepreneurs

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
get into market. And then there's

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
network building around all of the

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,239
stakeholders that are necessary for

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,159
those companies to be successful. That

82
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,800
was the experiment that Raphael set up

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,760
back in 2017 when he launched the engine

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,440
out of MIT. We are now eight years in

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,360
and I'll tell you a little bit about

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,400
where we've come and I think where we're

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,519
going. Uh on the venture side, we have

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,720
funded about 65 companies across three

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,879
broad categories. The first is energy.

90
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,400
The second is human health. The third is

91
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,040
advanced systems and infrastructure. And

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
if I'm being candid, the third bucket is

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,720
a catchall for breakthrough science and

94
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
engineering that applies to everything

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,840
that isn't in human health or in energy.

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,519
Um, but I think primarily you we have

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,599
seen a lot of concentration in some of

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,799
the AI hardware um the chips, robotics,

99
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,879
etc. that that are prominent today. Um

100
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,640
so we've invested across three these

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,720
three broad sectors. Um

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,840
and our portfolio has grown quite

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,440
significantly over that time. Um raising

104
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,520
over seven billion dollars. We're now

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
investing out of our third core fund. Uh

106
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,600
we have about a billion just north of a

107
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,960
billion under management uh to support

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,880
these companies as they are scaling. Um

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,639
so we're we're eight years or eight

110
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,720
years really into this experiment that

111
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,120
MIT set up. uh and I think the the the

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,759
the returns on that experiment we'll

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,639
we'll know but we won't know till 2035

114
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,639
20 240 um whether or not it has been

115
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,280
successful but I think we have early

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
proof points of that success um we have

117
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
proof points on the capital side and the

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,800
company growth side and and a lot of

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,800
these companies are thriving and and

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
expanding into global markets but I

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,759
think equally important is we have proof

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,600
points on the human capital side. So

123
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,479
over the last 20 years and some of you

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
know this very well, this ecosystem has

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,639
developed a very robust pipeline for

126
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,560
life science startups uh capital for

127
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,639
those startups and a very close

128
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,199
connection between those startups in the

129
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,280
corporate world. All of the many of the

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,840
life science corporates majors are are

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,240
located based have have a facility here

132
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,639
in Cambridge probably within 500 ft of

133
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,039
this building. um we are beginning to

134
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,280
and and I think importantly

135
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,520
because of that we see a lot of fluid

136
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,840
labor mobility between the large

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,320
corporate world and the startup world

138
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,919
that is a real important s symbol of

139
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,320
health of the ecosystem itself. Um when

140
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,960
you have companies that can recruit

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,120
executive talent out of large companies

142
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,120
there's a signal about the the

143
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
reliability and the the health of that

144
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,199
ecosystem that people are willing to

145
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,520
make the jump into startups. as I see it

146
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
when we see that fluidity I have a lot

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
more confidence and I think the

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,960
individuals have a lot more confidence

149
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,680
making the jump into startups it's a

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,680
signal that if one startup fails there

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,080
is another one to go to and another one

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
after that and you can build a career

153
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,400
doing that in a way that you can't when

154
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,240
there's not a really robust ecosystem

155
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,199
around you we are beginning to see that

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,400
outside of life sciences so in energy in

157
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,360
robotics uh in in AI hardware chips

158
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,039
fetonics etc this area has become I

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,039
think a really important place for

160
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,199
people to build careers in these sectors

161
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,120
and that in itself is a signal of the

162
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,840
success of of the of the experiment

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,560
Raphael launched uh eight years ago. So

164
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
alongside that, venture capital dollars

165
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,479
have begun to flow into the sector in a

166
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,000
fairly robust way, climbing through the

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,960
co years uh and being relatively

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
uh I think reliably resilient uh in

169
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,560
recent years when venture markets have

170
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
pulled back uh from a lot of these

171
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,039
sectors and I think that is because the

172
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,120
the opportunities that these sectors

173
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,599
provide remain large uh and and um

174
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
exciting for investors as as people are

175
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,240
going forward. Now there's a lot of

176
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
variance here and we'll get into that

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
and what I think the next five years

178
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
look like will be telling uh for for

179
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,479
many of these sectors. We'll get into

180
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,880
that in a little bit. Um there is a new

181
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,280
landscape emerging uh and four key

182
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,120
themes that we track uh that are

183
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,960
affecting these companies and these

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,400
sectors. Um, you heard from Paul a lot

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,000
about AI. Uh, and that you can't escape

186
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,560
a board meeting, a newspaper, uh, any

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,160
headline that doesn't include AI today.

188
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
And that should raise some red flags.

189
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,520
Um, but it is also something we all have

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,120
to kind of co be cognizant of. Um,

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
beyond the application layer, I think

192
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,680
where Paul was focusing a lot of his

193
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,440
presentation, AI as a general purpose

194
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,560
technology is being you being used

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,639
across industrial sectors. um to improve

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,479
productivity, to improve efficiency, to

197
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,560
reduce costs. Um correspondingly, energy

198
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,479
demand to power the inference and the

199
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,720
training for AI has has is is escalating

200
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,680
in a way that we have not seen on the

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,560
energy side in over 25 years. So demand

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,280
going up is a massive driver of economic

203
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,800
activity and it allows startups to

204
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,319
compete in a way particularly on the

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,440
energy side that they have not been able

206
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,120
to before uh in in the last 30 years or

207
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,800
so. Um so that's super exciting. Second

208
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,519
and we'll get into more details there.

209
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,039
Second is uh you may acknowledge that

210
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
there's a new administration in

211
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,839
Washington and the game is changing in

212
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,480
many different ways and finding signal

213
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,440
from the noise coming out of the uh the

214
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
news every day is difficult. Uh so we've

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,480
had to spend some time there but I think

216
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,480
there is there is uh some clear insight

217
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,920
now that you can drive and and take a

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,839
look across portfolios to be productive.

219
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,440
Um and we'll see where that goes. Um the

220
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,320
third is that mature deep technologies

221
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
have now been established, have been

222
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,640
successful and provide a very clear

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,839
roadmap for how a startup doing deep

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,080
tech can reduce cost, scale and increase

225
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,040
returns for their shareholders. Um we've

226
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,160
seen it in in energy and solar and

227
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,839
batteries. Uh we've seen it in in um

228
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,600
life sciences with AlphaFold and we've

229
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,880
certainly seen it on the chip side uh

230
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,399
with some of the largest companies in

231
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:37,360
the world. Um but despite that there is

232
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,760
a growing disconnect in the macro

233
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
realities of the economy that we that I

234
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,399
see and the reality of venture markets

235
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,800
and we'll get into that as as we go

236
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,440
here. So starting with the top um uh

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Paul took you back 250 years. I'm only

238
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,839
going to take you back 250 years. um

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
innovate and and then and candidly I

240
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,519
think actually this would be a pretty

241
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,800
linear chart from two 2500 years ago to

242
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,240
1700 AD. Um but innovation really

243
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,120
started with the industrial revolution.

244
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,920
It has had epoes of growth and

245
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,720
acceleration in that time and we are now

246
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,399
at the very beginning of the next scurve

247
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,079
that is going to launch productivity

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,000
forward and that uh will impact the

249
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,640
economy at large in every sector within

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,320
it just as all of these other ones did

251
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,279
over the last 250 years. Um,

252
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,320
AI is driving the largest construction

253
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,160
boom, the largest economic mobilization

254
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,560
that we have seen in the United States

255
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,440
since World War II. This isn't just in

256
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,519
software, it is across the board. And it

257
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,880
is massively shifting the contours of

258
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,880
the economy uh and the landscape for

259
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,680
companies that are going in. So just as

260
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,079
an example, uh some of our companies on

261
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,200
the energy side used to be selling power

262
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,920
or working with utilities who um you

263
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,640
know are not the fastest movers and now

264
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,000
they're selling to Microsoft and Google

265
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,160
and Meta and Nvidia who move at the rate

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
of software innovation.

267
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,920
So being able to keep up with that is a

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,040
is a new challenge for these companies

269
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,079
as they're going forward. Um Paul

270
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
mentioned this a little bit so I'm not

271
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,680
going to harp on it but innovation is

272
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,640
unfolding faster than ever. It took Jack

273
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,720
Chat GPT just uh two months to hit 100

274
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,040
million users. Uh and you can see the

275
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,079
comparison across some of the prior uh

276
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,680
software startups but that is

277
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,959
accelerating the speed at which

278
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,760
companies need to need to operate. Um,

279
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,519
and the Magnificent 7's cash flow,

280
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
orders of magnitude larger than it was

281
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,040
previously, is being reinvested into a

282
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,040
lot of the foundational pieces of AI,

283
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040
the energy demand that that comes along

284
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200
with it, the hardware for the chips for

285
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,959
that they are necessary for training our

286
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,680
modules, etc. Um

287
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,000
Jensen Hang suggested that over the next

288
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,160
five years he expects that there will be

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,320
three to four trillion dollars invested

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,320
in the AI infrastructure opportunity and

291
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,399
as I look at different projections for

292
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,959
what that looks like I'm not sure

293
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,560
anybody has a real clear sense it is

294
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,240
growing rapidly uh and we'll we'll see

295
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
it's g but it is it is certainly going

296
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
to continue to grow.

297
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,399
Um

298
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,000
however as I mentioned the hardware

299
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,920
innovation cycle is two to three years

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,480
the software innovation cycle and and

301
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,440
it's very hard to move that needle right

302
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,279
that that is mostly has physical

303
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,000
constraints the software innovation

304
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,240
cycle is rapid it is it is months it's

305
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,079
maybe a year but I think that's getting

306
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,880
ever shorter as Paul mentioned um there

307
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,079
is a ton of a ton of things happening at

308
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,600
the application layer and the

309
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,639
architecture layer and the foundational

310
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,480
model layer. Um where we look for it on

311
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,000
the deep tech side, we look for

312
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,079
interesting things in compute and

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,320
connectivity, the infrastructure to

314
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,560
underly those and then the power to

315
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,279
serve it. And there's real opportunity

316
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,720
that I think is sustained long term uh

317
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,279
to serve those markets uh from a from

318
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,959
the physical instantiation of AI which

319
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
is super interesting. We've I've put

320
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,880
some of our companies here um that are

321
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
working in that space and we'll talk

322
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,519
about a few of them in greater detail uh

323
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
going forward. I mentioned that global

324
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,720
energy demand is accelerating for the

325
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,440
first time in 25 years. Um on the right

326
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,320
you can see the projections around

327
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,839
global data center uh electricity

328
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,440
demand. Basically base case 2% growth

329
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,040
over over the next 10 years, high case

330
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,120
4% growth. Um, but just a month ago, Sam

331
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,839
Alman said, "Actually, I think we're

332
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,639
going to need 250 gigawatts just for

333
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,480
open AI. 250 gawatts for reference in

334
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,839
the United States would be about 30% of

335
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,079
electricity demand." Um, so that's these

336
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,920
numbers are really stabs in the dark.

337
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,320
And the IEA last week came out with

338
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,800
their projections um, which are really

339
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
interesting. They they have noted the IA

340
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,079
is the International Energy Agency.

341
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
noted a little bit of this, but the

342
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,920
numbers just don't add up. And and it's

343
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,440
not their fault. Projections are hard.

344
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,480
Um and but the uncertainty around this

345
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,240
is is pretty impressive. The upside uh

346
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
being quite massive for energy

347
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,160
development. Um

348
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,360
the next question you should ask is

349
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,839
well, what energy is going to be

350
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,920
deployed to meet that? Uh and and that

351
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,240
is that is I think the question on a lot

352
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,240
of our minds

353
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
for sure. Some of that is going to be

354
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,199
met with existing resources, fossil

355
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,160
fuels, gas in the United States. Some

356
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,399
coal plants are coming out of retirement

357
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,680
um to be able to meet the demand here in

358
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,320
the next three to five years. And that

359
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,160
has really serious implications for the

360
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,880
climate. Um but on the on the market

361
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,680
side, that demand is also pulling new

362
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,800
technologies into market. We are seeing

363
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,760
um utility scale projects in nuclear, in

364
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,720
geothermal, in energy storage, in fusion

365
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,120
all being announced all for with the

366
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,279
effort of getting shovels in the ground

367
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,920
over the next five to six years for new

368
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,519
technology at large scale, which is

369
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,240
really exciting. So, it's a really great

370
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,959
time to be in that in that space. Here

371
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,639
I've got um three MIT spin-offs to

372
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,959
highlight. Form Energy is doing long

373
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,480
duration energy storage. They are they

374
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,800
just actually commissioned their first

375
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,600
project in Minnesota with Great River

376
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
Energy. Um Blue Energy is developing a

377
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
small modular nuclear reactor

378
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,320
development platform with their first

379
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,079
project down in Texas. Um MIT the CEO is

380
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
out of nuclear science and engineering

381
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,199
form energies technology out of lab of

382
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,320
Yetme. Uh and Quaz is doing enhanced

383
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,399
geothermal. um they are they are out of

384
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,079
the plasma science infusion center um

385
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,199
with a project that they're developing

386
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,120
uh in the ring of fire in Nevada um

387
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,800
concurrent to all of this and and all

388
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,240
three of these companies now are working

389
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,920
with the kind of AI hyperscalers um

390
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,639
because that is where the demand is

391
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,639
pulling them into market.

392
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,360
Shifting gears just a little bit. Um

393
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,959
it's it's quite clear that the new

394
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,079
administration in DC is shifting uh

395
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,240
efforts. Um this was that pulling back a

396
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,399
whole bunch of Biden era grant programs.

397
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,279
Uh and now you repurposing that capital

398
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,360
uh into new projects. Uh the geopolitics

399
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,600
and national priorities are shaping

400
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,519
technology choices uh and company

401
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,360
choices. Um in the in the United States

402
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,839
uh supply chain resilience has always

403
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,519
been something that we have prioritized.

404
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,279
I think right now the administration is

405
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,320
act is funding um a putting a lot of

406
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,400
money into expanding our ability to do

407
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:10,319
rare earth uh processing uh novel novel

408
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,480
recycling technologies of of um critical

409
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,480
minerals and um the opportunity to

410
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,160
onshore manufacturing for rare earth

411
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,360
magnets. There was a few announcements

412
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,919
recently. Um all of that is providing a

413
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,919
signal of a fairly robust industrial

414
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,240
policy uh that I don't think we had

415
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,480
anticipated. Um but it is certainly

416
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,919
coming on the energy side. Finding

417
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,080
signal from the noise has been

418
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:39,200
difficult. Uh and you all have tracked

419
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:42,960
the headlines. Um it has been this

420
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,880
I would say um pros and cons across the

421
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,760
board of of what is happening. And

422
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,880
certainly uh the notion of climate

423
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,240
change is not one that is embraced. Um

424
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,799
but I think we are beginning to see some

425
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,720
policies that look quite favorable for

426
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,240
technologies that could ultimately in

427
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,400
the fullness of time serve uh to to

428
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,960
reduce massive amounts of emissions and

429
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,000
I think innovation is a key lever uh to

430
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,679
do that in the absence of of robust

431
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,280
federal policy. Um across our portfolio

432
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,039
we have five broad areas uh in the on

433
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,200
the energy side we have we invest into

434
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,360
base load energy transmission and

435
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,160
distribution and storage we invest into

436
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,120
electrification of end uses and

437
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,880
industrial processes alternative fuels

438
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,559
resource efficiency and industrial

439
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,160
processes

440
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,240
um there's a handful of our companies

441
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,520
there but I think what's really

442
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,480
interesting is um when I look at the

443
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,960
effect of existing policy, US and Europe

444
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,120
policy on our portfolio.

445
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,880
It's actually a lot of green. Um there's

446
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,520
a significant amount of uh subsidy even

447
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,320
through the the tax reform package that

448
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
passed the this summer um for base load

449
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,520
energy, transmission, distribution, and

450
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,760
storage. If I was to highlight one area

451
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,640
where I think it is challenging is it is

452
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,880
in electrification and it's because cost

453
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,280
of electric power will go up without

454
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,200
subsidies for solar and wind. Um

455
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,440
that was already happening though

456
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,360
because the demand for power from data

457
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,679
centers is driving up electric power

458
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,640
everywhere and so the challenges for

459
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,160
electrifying end uses and uh we're we're

460
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
already meeting some headwinds.

461
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,720
Certainly those are more aggressive now

462
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,000
um without the support for wind and

463
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:37,280
solar here at the United States. Um and

464
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,039
I worth noting this is a energy specific

465
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,440
set of policies. This is not a climate

466
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,440
specific set of policies. So certainly

467
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,440
our ability to meet climate goals under

468
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,080
this framework is not uh not possible.

469
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,520
Um we are going to be building and

470
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,200
already have started building a whole

471
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,360
lot more natural gas. I mentioned the

472
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,600
coal restarts that are happening in the

473
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
United States. This is not about that.

474
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
This is about how does how does the

475
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,760
setup policies impact our portfolio.

476
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,840
It's a different conversation. Um and if

477
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,360
I were investing as a project developer

478
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,919
in wind and solar, this would be a

479
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,160
different presentation.

480
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,080
Um

481
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,360
the third topic is these mature

482
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,640
playbooks for new technologies showing

483
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,559
how you can return shareholder value,

484
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,960
reduce costs and scale into these

485
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,760
markets. Um I'm going to talk through a

486
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,360
couple examples. The first is on solar

487
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,360
and lithium ion batteries. Um

488
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,400
on the on the left hand side of this

489
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,200
chart you can see the cost reductions as

490
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,039
a function of production scale for solar

491
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,320
and for lithium ion. That learning rate

492
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,200
shows the opportunity of innovation to

493
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,480
change markets. you've got in I actually

494
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,120
I was in the energy storage world

495
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
gridscale energy storage world before um

496
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,520
being in my current role and I watched

497
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,679
as a competitor the cost of lithium ion

498
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,159
drop from about $1,000 a kil a kilowatt

499
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,280
hour to less than a hundred uh and that

500
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,360
was frankly terrifying um and but but

501
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,679
that is what what's happening and has

502
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,320
the potential to happen across

503
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,240
technology trajectories it is also why

504
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,000
in the fullness of time innovation gives

505
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,080
us the best chance to combat climate

506
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
With new technologies coming into market

507
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,720
and using this new demand to scale them

508
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,480
up, we can change markets. It is

509
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,280
actually the only thing in energy that

510
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,760
ever has is innovation. And the three of

511
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,280
them over the last 30 years, the first

512
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,880
is natural gas hydraulic fracturing dro

513
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,799
completely changed the energy landscape

514
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,400
here in the United States and globally.

515
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,960
The second is solar and the third is

516
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,000
lithium ion. we have new trajectories in

517
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,000
in fision and fusion and geothermal that

518
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,559
pro that present that same opportunity

519
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and it's immensely hopeful

520
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,000
in um oh a couple uh energy companies in

521
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,960
the portfolio also MIT startups all of

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,919
them um mantle is developing carbon

523
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,640
capture solutions they're their first

524
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,440
project is is in construction and almost

525
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,640
commissioned in uh at a pulp and paper

526
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
facility in Quebec form energy I

527
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
mentioned before longduration energy

528
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,720
storage atmazero

529
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,200
uh deployed their first air the world's

530
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,520
first airsource heat pump steam boiler

531
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,039
uh to a food and beverage customer in

532
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,880
Lovelin Colorado and Vier is uh

533
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,520
deploying and they just commissioned

534
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,120
their first unit of high temperature

535
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,440
superconducting cables uh for inside the

536
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,480
data center power modules to the rack

537
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,400
and transmission lines um all of these

538
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,960
are now in manufacturing and in scale

539
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,880
scale up and so those cost those cost

540
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,320
projections and the the ability to drive

541
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,480
down and compete um they're on the cusp

542
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,919
of realizing that reality. Um AI has

543
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,679
also given us a whole bunch of um

544
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,760
productive um I think acceleration of

545
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,200
innovation and potential in the life

546
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,760
science space. Um Alphafold is the data

547
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,320
point there. The ability to create a

548
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,799
protein bank that accelerates our

549
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,799
understanding of how uh how to treat

550
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,360
disease is is transformative and has

551
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,520
been is a massive leap in the field.

552
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,840
That's super exciting. We now have the

553
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,080
opportunity to take a look at where else

554
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,600
can we see that type of innovation come

555
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,799
to market quickly. um

556
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,840
in life sciences the access to data is

557
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,799
going to drive the speed of AI of of

558
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,720
adoption of AI and the usefulness of AI.

559
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,960
A lot of that is happening at that top

560
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,679
layer. Um the real challenge and the

561
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,480
real opportunity that we see is the

562
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,520
ability to both shorten the pre-clinical

563
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,120
phase with robust data sources and and

564
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,840
technologies that are able to accelerate

565
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,240
the data production. And then

566
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,559
alternatively if you can take your

567
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,520
clinical trial success rate which is now

568
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,400
less than 10% and you can increase that

569
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,960
you have you you can create a whole ton

570
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,320
of value in the economy and also also

571
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,400
produce many more uh life-changing

572
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,159
therapies uh which is which is really

573
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,039
exciting. So that's where we're looking

574
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,960
for those the next set of AI um AI

575
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,720
augmented success stories in the life

576
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,039
science.

577
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,360
All right. So um the

578
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,960
current dislocation between the

579
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,240
macroeconomic realities of what's

580
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,760
happening in the realities of VC

581
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,960
markets. So um I showed you the chart of

582
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,400
where we invest. 70% of venture dollars

583
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,679
are going into the application layer of

584
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,919
uh AI. So some of the many of the things

585
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,559
that Paul Paul talked about the

586
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,520
infrastructure layer of AI is where we

587
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,159
see a whole lot of resilient value. Um

588
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,120
and right now the venture landscape is

589
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,679
not fully a funding that in the way that

590
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,200
it probably needs to. Um I think what's

591
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,279
really interesting and this is

592
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,880
particularly true on the energy side uh

593
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:14,080
where you have um the demand signal

594
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,919
long-term demand signal uh very high and

595
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,000
yet the venture communities pulling back

596
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,480
right as we have proof points that they

597
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,480
can be successful and so it means that

598
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,120
from an investor perspective you've got

599
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,799
to build coalitions and groups of

600
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
investors that can work together to

601
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,880
bring these things to scale. I think one

602
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,840
of the things that makes me most excited

603
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,720
when I look at this moment in time is we

604
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,640
have a whole about

605
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,760
30 40% of deals involve corporates and

606
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,799
they are all engaged partners in this uh

607
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,400
in this opportunity um over the long

608
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,559
term that's really important that it

609
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:56,480
continues. So, I'm going to leave you

610
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:58,640
with um one last thought and uh this is

611
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,600
the key question that everybody should

612
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,279
be asking. Is this a boom cycle or is

613
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,320
this a bubble, right? Um and there are

614
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,520
reasons to believe that both are true

615
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,880
and that is probably unsatisfying. Um

616
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,640
but the story of capitalism is money

617
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,240
will flow where there is large

618
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,480
opportunity. The.com bubble burst

619
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,600
paved the way for the magnificent 7

620
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,400
today. Out of that moment in time came

621
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,720
the largest companies in the world. The

622
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,720
same is probably true today. Out of this

623
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,720
moment in time in 20 years, we will have

624
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,279
the most the largest companies in the

625
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,760
world. Um, and that's super exciting.

626
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,760
The next thing, and I I I felt this way

627
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,440
listening to Paul's talk. The next thing

628
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,240
you've got to think about is how does

629
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,400
this affect people, right? And what is

630
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,320
what is the productivity enhancement?

631
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,320
How are people going to be affected? How

632
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,159
are jobs going to be affected? And how

633
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,200
do you build culture around the use of

634
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,159
AI so that is sustainable prosperity for

635
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,400
everybody? Uh that is the challenge I

636
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,440
think of our time going forward. And

637
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,279
with that, Katarina, I'm I'm all set.

638
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,919
I'll open it up for a couple questions.

639
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,360
We have time.

640
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,200
>> Yes. Thank you, Michael. Super

641
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,600
insightful. Thank [applause] you. Um any

642
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,240
questions for Michael? We have time to

643
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,240
maybe a couple.

644
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,559
>> It looks like

645
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,559
>> one in the back.

646
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,559
>> Okay.

647
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,679
>> Um I really like what you said about

648
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:37,360
data availability funding or enabling

649
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:41,120
AI. How do you get um over the

650
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,200
disconnect with investors and VCs um to

651
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,520
fund things hard tech that's actually

652
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,600
going to provide that data?

653
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,880
>> Yeah. So I think um there's

654
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,919
there [clears throat] the sectors are a

655
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,600
little different. Um but when we look

656
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,120
and we invest at the very early stages

657
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,799
of these companies um even at those

658
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,080
early stages finding the investor

659
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,399
syndicates that are going to be

660
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,320
productive partners for the long term is

661
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,080
ever more critical particularly as the

662
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,640
venture markets are pulling back. Um so

663
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,799
that is the core body of work that takes

664
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,640
place in those early days is who are the

665
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,840
partners that you're going in with? How

666
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,880
do you work together? What are the

667
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,559
different roles everybody's going to

668
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,320
play and how much capital do you have to

669
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,120
get them? You got to take these

670
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,279
companies further down field than maybe

671
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,240
a traditional seed investor might

672
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,240
originally think about it.

673
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,320
>> Thank you, Michael. I'm curious of your

674
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,399
exit strategy. Um, for instance, like

675
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:48,799
Mantel, it requires huge capex for the

676
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:51,440
company to grow. Um I know uh Mantel is

677
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,480
also has been working really hard to uh

678
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,880
find the project financing. So what is

679
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,679
your um strategy not only for the exit

680
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,840
also for about you know ramp up their

681
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,520
really like business scale.

682
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,440
>> Yeah. So I think on the project

683
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,799
financing side scale up this is where

684
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,080
we're in a different moment in time

685
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,399
because we are actually getting

686
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,240
customers to pay for that and those

687
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,279
customers will pay for it. the first

688
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,440
one. These are the hyperscalers and and

689
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,159
other similar similar parties are

690
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,640
willing to pay for the first one. Um or

691
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
have a PPA to cover the cost of the

692
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,279
first one that you can then get project

693
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,440
finance into which wouldn't have

694
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,880
happened before. Um and then uh but

695
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
you're giving up you're giving up some

696
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,840
rights to the next set of projects,

697
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,679
right? So they're doing it because

698
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,960
they're they are buying capacity into

699
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,960
the 2030s, well into the 2030s. Um and

700
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
so there's there's novel formations of

701
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,480
of coalitions of of players that are

702
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,520
enabling that in a way that didn't

703
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:54,799
happen three four years ago. Um on the

704
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,799
exit side, so I think one um the these

705
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,279
different sectors behave differently uh

706
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,679
as it relates to exit markets. However,

707
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,000
the what what I'm seeing and I think

708
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,600
what the markets are seeing is if you're

709
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,279
selling into into th those customers

710
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,799
like they believe in the long-term

711
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,600
upside there and you are being traded at

712
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,919
or or valued at revenue multiples that

713
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,360
hard tech companies never saw before. So

714
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,520
there was an announcement last last

715
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,039
week. It was a liquid cooling company

716
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,799
acquired by Eaton uh for $9 billion and

717
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,480
that company had something somewhere

718
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,159
between 200 and 500 million in revenue.

719
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,919
It's private so I'm not exactly sure but

720
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,559
but that that's the multiple that we're

721
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,279
talking about um because of that upside

722
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:41,600
the topline growth potential. Um if you

723
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:44,720
are if you are a company selling um a a

724
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,559
piece of infrastructure to a utility

725
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,640
you're you're tra you get traded at like

726
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,559
a two 2x 3x versus 20. That's how the

727
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,200
the markets are just valuing the valuing

728
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,399
these companies differently. Um and it's

729
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,880
interesting to see I think the

730
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,320
