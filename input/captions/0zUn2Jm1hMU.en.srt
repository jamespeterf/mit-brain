1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,960
like a lot of architects throughout

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,760
history, um uh I'm a practitioner who

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,679
also looks a lot at history. And so I I

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,200
like to uh um just like architects in

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,920
the Renaissance looked at Roman

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,600
examples, um uh I've learned a lot

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,880
especially from the uh thinking about

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
the history of technology and the

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,119
history of um of thinking about the city

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,240
um as I've tried to imagine new and and

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,160
important ways of practice today. So um

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,120
uh you know one example um uh in in the

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,160
local code book that I wrote about the

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,079
um at that point the over 3,000 designs

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,480
that we' produced using these kinds of

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,399
systems. I also looked uh historically

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,640
at at three um uh important figures uh

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
who influenced the work in in their in

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,440
their writing. Some of them were very

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,079
well known like the urban um uh urban

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
thinker Jane Jacobs very revolutionary

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,039
thinker thinker in about the city in the

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,640
20th century um famously duled with

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:11,119
Robert Moses um uh then uh also uh an

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,560
artist like Gordon Madlark who was doing

26
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,280
work with um they parcels in New York

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
City in the 1970s but also um actually

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159
right before his death was very

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
interested in community education and

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,799
engagement.

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,200
around these sites um in particular on

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,119
the Lower East Side and then less known

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
figures like Howard Fischer who was the

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,240
inventor of modern GIS as an architect

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,360
uh uh at the Graduate School of Design

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,159
um at Harvard um but then whose work was

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,640
taken and and transformed into modern

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,799
mapping systems in a way that he um did

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
not appreciate and was against the

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,920
earlier kind of collective spirit of his

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,840
work. So all of these things um uh uh

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
are important to me in terms of making a

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,520
link between um historical ways of

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
thinking but also how we need to change

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,159
them to practice effectively in the

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,920
present. I mean I think for me the the

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
kind of intellectual history is pretty

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,840
important. So lots of people know about

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,000
Jane Jacobs, but lots of people don't

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,440
necessarily know that um uh you know her

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,080
only uh uh formal education um uh was

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,160
actually um uh uh involved a great deal

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
of learning about evolution evolutionary

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,879
biology and natural systems and how they

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,520
worked. So when in her famous book death

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,120
and life of great American cities at at

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
the um you know at the very beginning

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
she says I won't use a single metaphor

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,560
in this book in this book cities need to

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
be thought about as they are but then

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,599
constantly throughout the book she's

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,680
using words like ganglia and uh uh uh

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
and vessels and and and all kinds of

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
words from natural systems and and what

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
she's really doing is making an

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
assertion that a city is uh to a certain

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
extent a natural system or we need to

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,560
understand it as such something that's

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
evolved over time uh just like our own

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,160
complex bodies and needs to be treated

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
as such and not you know in her terms

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,040
you know hacked around and and amputated

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,360
and and uh uh as many urban designers

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,120
were um at the time she was writing or a

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,599
figure like Gordon Madclar is you know

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,560
famous for cutting buildings in half um

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,120
uh and a range of artistic practices but

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,879
um what's less wellknown about him was

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,879
first of all the the grounding of a lot

80
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,200
of his art artistic work in a kind of

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,959
critique of urban redevelopment because

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,360
it was urban redevelopment that was

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,599
making you condemned homes available to

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,680
slice up and do things with. And then

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,319
also that again right before he um died

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,120
too young in 1977, he was shifting his

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,599
work towards um community education in

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
the context of abandoned sites in the uh

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,040
building sites or vacant lots in the on

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
the lower side. And this was a very

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,959
important pivot in his work. So, um, you

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,920
know, we always, uh, uh, one great, um,

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,080
uh, truth of, uh, of, uh, the world of

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,519
ideas, if is if you think you understand

95
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
something, you're probably wrong. And

96
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,200
so, uh, you know, I always like to kind

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
of dig under the surface of these things

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,040
that we think we know. Um, especially

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
things that are fundamental to thinking

100
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
about certain kinds of practice that I

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,280
care about. And and usually the the

102
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,280
truth is way more interesting.
