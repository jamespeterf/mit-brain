1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,000
So, good afternoon everyone. Hope you

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,839
had a an enjoyable lunch and some good

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,040
conversations. Um, so we got a a a kind

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
of panel for the next kind of three

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,320
quarter an hour or so. So what I was

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
hoping to do was to try to kind of pull

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,839
together some of the the disperate

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,119
threads from some of the talks you've

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,039
seen so far and some of the talks going

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,520
to come on this afternoon and try to get

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
like a a higher level view of where we

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,119
are with communications where some of

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,279
the big issues are what the actual

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,960
problems are where the system's working

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,760
for us where it's not working for us

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,600
where the big levers uh might be. So I

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,120
want to introduce my my panelists. So

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
David Shereé you already know from this

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
morning and I wanted to introduce Sanjay

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,399
at the end. Uh Sanjay is a senior

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,520
research fellow at Collins Aerospace. Uh

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,360
he's been a PI on various DARPA and AATO

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
projects. Um he has 29 granted patents I

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
believe.

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,360
>> Yeah. Right.

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,199
>> Close enough. Um and has been looking at

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,840
both kind of, you know, networking, AI,

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,120
machine learning in the aviation space

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,120
where you've got, you know, probably one

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,760
of the world's most denselyworked

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,760
objects at 30,000 ft moving around the

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
world. So I thought it was a good uh uh

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,479
good. So what we're going to do is kick

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
off by asking Sanjay to talk a little

35
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,520
bit about what's happening in aerospace

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,360
and communications, the applications

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,520
that sit on them, what we're learning as

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
an example of this really dense

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,479
environment. Um, and then I've got a

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
couple of questions I wanted to kind of

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,640
kick into the the group and then we'll

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,159
open the floor up for questions and uh

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
contentious questions and disagreements

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,080
and all that kind of stuff.

45
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,479
>> You have to keep people awake after

46
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
lunch.

47
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,080
>> Yeah. So we got sadly got the the

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,280
caffeinated end of the day. So So I'll

49
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,479
hand over to San do you want to tell us

50
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
a little bit about what's happening in

51
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,400
aerospace?

52
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
>> Sure. cases.

53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,320
>> Um, so I'll focus more about the

54
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,040
aircraft itself, not in what's around

55
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,320
the aircraft or the IT side of things.

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,320
So there's there's perceived demand for

57
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,880
more and more applications on the on the

58
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,439
aircraft. Um, where the seats are going

59
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,360
to get modernized, galleys, labs and so

60
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,439
on. Um many of you may remember 3 four

61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,840
years ago there was something called CO

62
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,399
and there was a perception that the

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,280
aircraft were distributing the viruses

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,840
of bacteria around the world. So the

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,840
perception developed some more and

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,360
people said well the lavatory that's the

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,440
problem child and so we set about adding

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,480
functionality to the lavatory which

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,800
hasn't been upgraded in uh several years

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,000
on trying to make things touchless so

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,400
you could wave your arms around the

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
faucet and the faucet turns on and so on

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,120
and so forth right um and here I was uh

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,319
I'm a telecom guy I came from AT&T Bell

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,000
Labs and I thought how a I knew how a

76
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,640
toy toilet work because I'd replaced one

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,560
in my house, right? An aircraft toilet

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,440
is a very different beast. Okay, so um I

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,040
learned a lot in that program. Uh but

80
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,959
it's it's basically it's to say that

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,800
things in aerospace work very

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,599
differently than they do on Earth. And

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
we have to be cognizant about the fact

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,120
that an aircraft may take off in

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,599
Johannesburg, land in Paris, go to Japan

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,080
next from there go to India and so on.

87
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,080
It's it's working on a global basis.

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,800
>> So anything that you need to do needs to

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,680
be certified in all these places um

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,519
needs to operate in all those places. Uh

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,519
and we can for us as system developers

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,800
it's hard to say where the aircraft is

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,200
going to be next. So we need to plan for

94
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,200
all those eventualities

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,360
>> more.

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,480
>> Oh no, that's fantastic. Yeah, that's

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
great. [laughter] Thank you.

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,720
>> I can go on.

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
>> And I think that's really a metaphor for

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,239
some of the things we've been been

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,680
talking talking about today. So um so

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,120
I'll kick off. So so you want to just

103
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,360
pull a little bit on one of the threads

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,840
that uh that David kind of started to

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,159
pick out which is this sense of which in

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,760
this whole space of communications and

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,159
networking and the applications that sit

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,319
on top of them and the the layering of

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,560
the networks and the social media and

110
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,480
the you know there are some areas where

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
we got I was like a two by two of some

112
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
places where there's a technical

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,920
question. Have we got is is the issue a

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,840
technical one and one way is it's a

115
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,760
money routing one um technical non non

116
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,599
technical non-technical versus

117
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,359
successful money routing non-successful

118
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,720
money routing. So something like the

119
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,359
data centers were a good example of

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,919
somewhere where we had a really serious

121
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,479
technical problem but a system that

122
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,919
could root money to to to make that

123
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,120
happen. Whereas in things like social

124
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,280
media, we have this difficult social

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,840
issue but no money routing problem that

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,479
allows us to um so I really want to ask

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,320
everybody so you know what's their sense

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,840
of where the action is in the

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,400
communication space all the layers and

130
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000
across all the spaces where we have

131
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
either a money routing problem we need

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,280
to fix or we have a technical problem

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,400
that is really kind of pressing that we

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,639
really need to drill down on.

135
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
>> Let's talk with David. I' I' I'd

136
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,360
actually [clears throat] add a third

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,759
dimension to that which is

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,400
sort of the societal dimension to it and

139
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,400
and the interplay. So I you know I love

140
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,800
the talks this morning because as you

141
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,520
say in some sense they're dealing with

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,680
an extremely hard

143
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,160
extremely

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,199
interesting area but in some sense it's

145
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,240
single-dimensional. It's technology and

146
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,400
we can do the technology and MIT excels

147
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,360
at doing the technology

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,560
and the area that I find myself in is

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,320
this mushy one where there are technical

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,080
dimensions to it, there are financial

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,479
dimensions to it, there are

152
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,160
inexplicable societies dimensions and of

153
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,320
course

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,320
you know

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,639
my mind wandered off for a

156
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,960
There's a I am told which is to say I

157
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,039
might be wrong. I am told that in

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,680
certain Native American traditions when

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,199
there was a tribal conclave and they

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,600
were getting together to discuss some

161
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,800
weighty matter

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,039
one person might say who speaks for the

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,639
wolf

164
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:14,000
who speaks for that which has no voice

165
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,520
and who speaks for society and that's

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,120
not just the money. So, it's a it's a

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,639
it's a mushy multi-dimensional space and

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
that's very hard to get a discourse

169
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,240
going. It's hard to get it going in an

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
academic environment.

171
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,560
It's hard to get it going in a societal

172
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,479
environment and we that's problem of

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
civil society to try to figure out how

174
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,240
to discipline Facebook. I mean, it just

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,560
so

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,479
I that's not the only hard problem. It's

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,800
obviously the one that I'm attracted to

178
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,720
because I see what's happened to the

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,840
inter internet. But I I think living in

180
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,319
that multi-dimensional space is

181
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,120
something that takes a great deal of

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,960
thought,

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,639
multiple voices. We need a grand

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,639
conversation around some of these

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,319
things. How do you orchestrate that?

186
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,039
Who's in charge?

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:10,479
>> Very good. Um for me uh I think like the

188
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,280
physical layer is mostly ignored till

189
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,440
like it's broken like so that's that's

190
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,080
where I live uh all the sexy stuff is

191
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,160
above right everyone gets funded

192
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,400
>> above uh we need you

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
>> yeah yeah of course right like we I mean

194
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,520
we are seeing this happen across the

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
world now with all the warfare it's

196
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,520
actually testing

197
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,360
um that layer

198
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,759
Um,

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,080
so yeah, that's that's where I I think

200
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:45,919
the hype cycles and and software really

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,960
live up on the, you know, higher up in

202
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,039
the stack. Um,

203
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,240
that's really what all I have. I mean

204
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,360
defense, you know, defense funding now

205
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,879
with Andreal and Palunteer getting a lot

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,240
of funding and hardware becoming more

207
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,080
interesting. I think some could argue

208
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,879
it's like maybe a VC way of like exiting

209
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,800
at a different round. Um that could be

210
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:20,000
it. But you know um software enabled

211
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,280
hardware is becoming more more

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,319
interesting now. Well, that that sounds

213
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,000
good to ask you actually just to just

214
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
join that bit. So that we talked about

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,800
quantum this morning. We talked about

216
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,960
integrated phonics. Um we didn't talk

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
about some of the things like um

218
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,320
computing in the photonics which is

219
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,560
another area that's being worked. You're

220
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,279
doing work on the meta materials and the

221
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,719
software enabled materials. Uh you

222
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,720
what's your sense of like the u this the

223
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,720
scope of that innovation space in the

224
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
hardware that might bring through

225
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
breakthroughs that will just disrupt

226
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,959
everything above it. you guys like

227
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
>> yeah I think it was uh Watson Watt who

228
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,800
said like give me the give me the third

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,519
best technology right because the first

230
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,320
will never happen uh the second will

231
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,399
take too long and the third will be here

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,160
tomorrow you know so um yeah I do think

233
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,120
I do think like Ukraine is a great

234
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,959
example it is showing us like warfare

235
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,800
like you know all our drones that the US

236
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,160
makes they're not that good. Um, the

237
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Ukrainians are the best drone

238
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,320
manufacturers in the world. Um, and you

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,959
know, they don't have like sophisticated

240
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,440
sensors. Uh, they won't have like

241
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,480
photonix chips. You know, precision

242
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,120
warfare was after World War II a big

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
thing. But now you don't need like you

244
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,680
you we're pretty good. Like now it's a

245
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,560
matter of going back to making those

246
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,880
weapons that or whatever. uh you know

247
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,120
scaling up which we we are we're still

248
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,399
focusing on the precision stuff. So

249
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,480
that's my my take.

250
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,560
>> Thank you. So so Sanjay you seem to be

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,399
in an industry that has it's on this

252
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,240
kind of um cusp of um both being

253
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,399
standards driven but also having to deal

254
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,640
with this complex um global governance u

255
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,200
and the need to innovate and the need to

256
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,200
change your systems. It's like you where

257
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,959
you where do you see the like the you

258
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
know the the major risks and levers in

259
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,560
those sort of systems? How how do you

260
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,560
deal with those?

261
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,279
>> How do I deal with this? I don't know.

262
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm a [laughter] technologist. I don't

263
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:30,800
deal with that stuff. But uh but I think

264
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:35,600
maybe I want to touch a little bit on uh

265
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:39,040
what Chai said. An aircraft today, a

266
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,399
relatively modern aircraft like a trip 7

267
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,480
um has just about every networking

268
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
technology that we all know of on the

269
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
aircraft,

270
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,079
right? We have CAN buses, RS230 to

271
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,920
RS485R, airing 667, which is basically

272
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,760
uh time triggered Ethernet and so on so

273
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,839
forth, right?

274
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,839
Every single thing is there. Now you

275
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
want to bring something new on board.

276
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,320
How do you integrate it and go to the

277
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,440
higher level applications

278
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,920
and is it possible to do this with

279
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,920
wireless? All right, I'm wireless. Um

280
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,312
David reminded me this morning how old I

281
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,440
was when

282
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:15,920
>> [laughter]

283
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
>> u

284
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,720
>> damn

285
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,320
>> when he talked about cell phones and so

286
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,320
on. Uh but how do we do this? So

287
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
there's parts of the industry that's

288
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,040
trying to drive towards standards so

289
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,480
that once you get a standard done and

290
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,000
things are compliant with the standard

291
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,160
it'll be more easy. All right. So SAPE

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,079
society of automotive engineers people

293
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,399
are actually driving aircraft standards.

294
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,800
All right. So they uh there's a group

295
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,320
called uh NTAC that's trying to unify

296
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,120
all these networks into a single

297
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,600
physical network and single protocol.

298
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,079
Um, and they'll probably publish

299
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,480
sometime in 2026 an airing standard. On

300
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,160
the wireless side, uh, we also heard

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,720
this morning from several people that it

302
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,880
takes too long to get things done. Maybe

303
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,160
it is the third best technology. I don't

304
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,240
know. [laughter]

305
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,760
Uh, so there's something called wake and

306
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
this is what happens when you put

307
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,200
engineers in charge of acronyms. It's

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,440
called wake, right? So it actually is

309
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,000
wic. And it's a wireless spectrum that

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,000
was allocated by the World Radio Council

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,240
just for internet working on an

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,360
aircraft, not between aircraft, just on

313
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,480
the single aircraft.

314
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,560
>> Oh,

315
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,880
>> so in principle uh oh by the way, why

316
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,079
does it take so long? Wakes's been in

317
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,959
discussion since 2004.

318
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,959
So that's 22 years and we still no

319
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,440
nowhere closer to getting product on the

320
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,720
aircraft. All right, that's how log

321
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,560
gets. It's now right now the what's

322
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
known as a search document is being

323
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,200
rationalized by all the pnts across the

324
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,360
world to say yeah we agree with this

325
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,320
right so if we can get v basically

326
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,959
approved by all the pnts and if NTAC

327
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,920
gets to a certain point where the data

328
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,360
models and and so on would be consistent

329
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,440
then it wouldn't matter what the

330
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,959
underlying physical layer is it could be

331
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,639
wire it could be wireless it could be

332
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:20,240
anything else right So that would be one

333
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,200
way to address these things which again

334
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,600
us as technologists are trying to make

335
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,959
it happen but we come back to the money

336
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,959
trail. Who's going to pay for it?

337
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
>> Excellent. So um we were just sat in out

338
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,240
in the the room across the way having

339
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
chat lunch and one of the things that we

340
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,519
kind of chatting quite a bit about was

341
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,279
this kind of question about kind of

342
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
decentralized and and centralized

343
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,880
systems. uh which is an argument that

344
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,959
we've really been having in the telecoms

345
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,720
industry for you know kind of at least

346
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,079
40 years um but and one of the senses

347
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,120
you know it's like with things like the

348
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,199
you know TCP and the internet um very

349
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,360
much kind of decentralized architectures

350
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
but resulted in to actually execute at

351
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,519
scale you know a fairly centralized set

352
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
of industries as as you mentioned but

353
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,839
the generative power of those is kind of

354
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,920
continues to you know new layers of

355
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
activity which then centralize in some

356
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,680
ways that sometimes good sometimes not

357
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,920
had you know I don't have any any

358
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,079
thoughts about what that process is and

359
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,839
when we need a counterforce of people

360
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,000
are talking about blockchain enabled

361
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,240
whatever as a as a counterforce to this

362
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,279
is it you when do we need these things

363
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,720
when don't we need them when they're

364
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,920
useful for innovation when do they get

365
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,560
in the way of deployment you know I'll

366
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
kick that one into the crowd

367
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,680
I mean the internet has to be

368
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,199
decentralized almost by definition

369
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,639
because it's global in scope we got

370
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,160
75,000 ISPs occasionally they merge

371
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,720
occasionally we tell them not to merge

372
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:50,079
but it's sort of there.

373
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,560
The web I think was the last great

374
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:56,320
decentralized application and

375
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,240
it has a very by the way it has a very

376
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,680
simple money routing model. The

377
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,639
economists actually have a name for it.

378
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,920
It's called bill and keep. Okay. People

379
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,519
pay for stuff at the edge and there's

380
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
nothing in the middle. There's the

381
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,800
protocols connect servers who might be

382
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,279
on the edge with as soon as you put

383
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,920
something in the middle a relay an

384
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,560
arbiter a recommendation engine the

385
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,839
who's paying for that but if you look at

386
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,839
the way email works for example when I

387
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
send a message I send it to my server

388
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,199
which sends it to your server we have

389
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
two servers I pay for my server or maybe

390
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,959
my company pays for my server you pay

391
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,480
for yours build and keep and this is a

392
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,040
and you see that model by the way in

393
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,079
certain social networking

394
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,680
application like matrix. But

395
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,240
what computer scientists will tell you

396
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,720
if they've thought about this is if you

397
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,600
can imagine accomplishing the goal with

398
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,759
a centralized solution, the sol

399
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
centralized solution

400
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
will be the one that's roll that's the

401
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,000
rock rolling down the hill. Okay. Easier

402
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,199
to monetize, more nimble

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
decision-making, top down

404
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,759
decision-making. You know, if one

405
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,240
company had been in charge of that

406
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,000
standard, they might have dominated it,

407
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
but you probably would have taken 20 20

408
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,199
years to get it done. We have been

409
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,800
trying to fix the routing protocol in

410
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,800
the internet, which is border gateway

411
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,240
protocol. I like to remind people in the

412
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,920
beginning, the government told us that

413
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
we were not allowed to have security on

414
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,120
the internet because the intelligence

415
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,360
community wanted to spy on it. That's

416
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,800
not a surmise. They said it. And we

417
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,839
weren't allowed to use encryption until

418
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,839
the year 2000. We designed BGP in 1990.

419
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,040
So surprise, it's not secure. We

420
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
couldn't use encryption. We were told

421
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,720
not to. So, but since then, we've been

422
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,000
trying to secure. We we're still trying

423
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
to solve this problem. Why? Because you

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,480
go into the ITF, there's there's a

425
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,199
there's a method that I have described

426
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,399
as the dueling pundit method in which

427
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,480
two very smart testosterone loaded

428
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,800
people stand up and yell at each other.

429
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,320
And we watched a committee lock up for

430
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,040
five years before we blew it up and

431
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,480
started over. And uh well, you know, if

432
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,160
a company's in charge, they can just

433
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,799
say, "Let's do it this way."

434
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,319
>> You know, there's a there's an Israeli I

435
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,880
perhaps every military has this

436
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,199
expression, but but I was taught this by

437
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,919
Israeli. He said, "One bad general is

438
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,720
better than two good ones. Sometimes you

439
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,720
just need a decision and it could be the

440
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,319
third best decision."

441
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,160
But how do you in that space fight the

442
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,959
gravitational pull of the centralized

443
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,480
solution which of course creates a

444
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,960
powerful actor who then begins to

445
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
exploit the situation and that's sort of

446
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,520
every once in a while you get a benign

447
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
actor but

448
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
uh and by the way I'll give you a

449
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,320
wonderful example of a benign actor uh

450
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,559
there's a there's a there's a social

451
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,640
well it's not really social well signal

452
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,400
there's an application called signal

453
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,679
anybody here use signal

454
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah. Okay. The guy who designed it, who

455
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,960
has the quirky name of Marley, Moxy

456
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,840
Marlin Spike, um said decentralized

457
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,520
solutions will never succeed.

458
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,360
They take too long. There's too much

459
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,320
problem with convergence. The only way

460
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,559
to build something like this is a

461
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,280
centralized solution. And I declare

462
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,960
myself benign dictator. [laughter]

463
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,640
And in order to prove that I am benign

464
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,039
dictator, I make the following promises

465
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
to you. I will never profile you, which

466
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,240
would have been hard because it's all

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,679
encrypted. I will never show you ads and

468
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,000
I will never charge you money. Oops.

469
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,000
Money routing.

470
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,440
You know how Signal is paid for? Anybody

471
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
here know how Signal is paid for?

472
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,640
>> Donations.

473
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,640
>> Donations. It's a 501c3.

474
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,320
>> Give them money.

475
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,039
You know what it costs per month per

476
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,360
user to run Signal?

477
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,960
10 cents.

478
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,200
That's a dollar a year. But they have 50

479
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,880
million users. The president of Signal,

480
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,760
who's a woman named uh there goes my

481
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,400
brain. Sorry. Not like I don't know her

482
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,120
well, but uh I'll come back to you in 30

483
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,799
seconds. She has to raise $50 million a

484
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,880
year to keep signal going.

485
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,640
>> Is that stable?

486
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,080
Right. Meredith Whitaker. Thank you. I

487
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,080
just have to stop. Let my brain catch

488
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,520
up. Um so,

489
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,160
you know, that's that's the benign

490
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,880
dictator model. you know, just get

491
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,640
Meredith to raise $50 million a year,

492
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,799
make a donation to signal. I I I this

493
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,600
this is a really complicated space.

494
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,960
>> I always been amazed um at your when you

495
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
come to these conclusions and it's like

496
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
the amounts of money involved like

497
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
really small. So, I remember you talking

498
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,320
about how much money would it cost would

499
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,720
it cost each consumer to not have ads on

500
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,080
TV and social media and it was like was

501
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,600
it like eight bucks or something like

502
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,240
that for the industry to go away? it was

503
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,440
going to if you read Facebook's annual

504
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,440
report very carefully

505
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,760
and you try to guess what percent of

506
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,760
their expenses

507
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,200
relate to optimizing their ad business

508
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,720
as opposed to optimizing their

509
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,960
consumer-basing business and you just

510
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,200
stripped all that out.

511
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,440
I think Facebook would cost per user a

512
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,679
dollar a month. It's small enough they

513
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,440
don't know how to collect it, right?

514
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,760
Meanwhile, they're sucking 25% out of

515
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,720
the total ad revenue in in the in the

516
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,520
world and Google's getting another 25%

517
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,520
and it's remarkably unstable.

518
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,039
>> Excellent. Thank you. So, a long answer.

519
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,360
Sorry. General comments, but also I was

520
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,720
very interested in kind of your views on

521
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,640
um kind of centralized versus

522
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,480
decentralized innovation in

523
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,919
communications and where that's you know

524
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,039
given this you know the structure of the

525
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,280
industry and those sorts of things would

526
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,520
be interesting. Yeah, I think if you if

527
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,720
you bring the costs down and you kind of

528
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:39,840
see this with um Helium Helium Networks

529
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,039
was a is a company that was trying to

530
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,039
connect IoT devices and they were using

531
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,360
these things called Sense Caps that were

532
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,720
essentially Raspberry Pies and uh um you

533
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,679
could buy one. I bought one during

534
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,559
COVID. I made a bunch of Helium tokens

535
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,720
that you could sell um on the on on

536
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,120
Coinbase, I guess. or some other

537
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,200
exchange if you make them cheap enough

538
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,799
like yeah people would you'd get these

539
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,120
secondary markets and people would uh uh

540
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,200
see an opportunity there. So, you know,

541
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,039
going like

542
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,080
RAIS, if you think of RAIS's that people

543
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,600
could probably start putting RAIS's on

544
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,640
on their houses and route traffic

545
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,280
um for 5G in the future and then, you

546
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,600
know, charge the network that, you know,

547
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,400
it could be that. So, make it cheap

548
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,000
enough, you'll get these smaller

549
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,480
economies.

550
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,520
So it could be decentralized.

551
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,520
>> Go San any thoughts?

552
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,360
>> Maybe touch a little bit on a single

553
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:52,080
company versus um and I think if you

554
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,400
looked at Cisco's model from 30 years

555
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,400
ago or whatever

556
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,960
and all they cared about was driving

557
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,799
data on the internet,

558
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,240
they would enable any application so

559
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,280
long as it brought data on their

560
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,440
routers. So they drove a lot of the

561
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,520
standards by building the hardware out

562
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,520
and the software out and then

563
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,360
encouraging it e to make it into a

564
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,240
standard. Right? So maybe that's the

565
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,840
model we need to pursue. Excellent. So I

566
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,679
just want to open it up to the I've got

567
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,880
a load more questions but more fun to

568
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,200
open it up to everybody in the audience.

569
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,039
So, has anybody got any kind of

570
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,480
questions or points of view around, you

571
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,480
know, where communications is going,

572
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,320
what the challenges are, uh, anything

573
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,640
you'd like to ask the panel

574
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,600
or I'll continue down my list as a

575
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,485
threat.

576
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,505
>> We're in the after lunch slump.

577
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:40,505
[laughter]

578
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,520
>> Okay. So, let me looking at your

579
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,320
question. I don't know if I need a bike

580
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,720
for the audience. Um, I'll speak loud

581
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,039
enough. So if I think about

582
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,760
commonalities among the speakers, uh

583
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,159
standardization is one, but thinking

584
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,080
about how do you be aggressive with

585
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,799
regards to innovation yet trying to

586
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,799
standardize the

587
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,919
>> great question

588
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
because uh I participate on many

589
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,440
standards bodies whether it's RTCA or

590
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,159
SAPE and so on and the first thing you

591
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,480
need to sign off is saying that you will

592
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,159
not bring an innovation or invention

593
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,559
unless you're going to make it generally

594
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,600
available to everybody.

595
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,840
So any inventor who's solving a complex

596
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:40,240
problem is not likely to bring maybe

597
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,840
it's the third best again, right? So um

598
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,840
because the standards body is pretty

599
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,840
much

600
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
unless you're a benefactor of some sort

601
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,120
and uh

602
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,720
>> you wouldn't be in because many

603
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,640
inventors would want to monetize their

604
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,760
own invention. So they probably will not

605
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,640
bring their best to a standards body.

606
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,320
Um, on the other hand, um, some of us

607
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,480
know the progression. I think David

608
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,720
touched on it this morning on on modems

609
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,720
that started at 9600 board or even less

610
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
than that, 300 board, right? And

611
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,320
>> I had one.

612
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,120
>> Yeah. All right. The acoustic coupler.

613
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,840
So, um, and then finally it became

614
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,480
basically a soft modem and the cheapest

615
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,080
soft modem you could get was around $3.

616
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,760
I think it was basically an analog front

617
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,559
end, right?

618
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,320
And the reason for the $3 was all the IP

619
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,200
that they were paying to the different

620
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,080
patents that were included in that. All

621
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,240
right. So, if you can get your invention

622
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,840
into a standard and have a standard

623
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,559
price for it across the industry,

624
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,360
then you're sort of set for life because

625
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,279
it's going to pay for a very long time.

626
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,159
Um,

627
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,159
that's one way to do it.

628
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,960
The IETF requires that if you bring a

629
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,360
technology which is covered by a patent,

630
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,640
you must commit that it will be licensed

631
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,159
on what's called reasonable and

632
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,159
non-discriminatory terms, rand.

633
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,559
We don't absolutely exclude

634
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,080
uh ideas that are patented. You just

635
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,360
can't offer to use them in an

636
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,520
discriminatory way.

637
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,159
And you can make money that way.

638
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,919
>> Yeah.

639
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,200
>> I think just I think one of the things

640
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,760
that strikes me in this kind of space is

641
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,720
that these things like standards and

642
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,480
open source are tool sets for kind of

643
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,760
driving these industry structures. So I

644
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,120
very struck with things like the like

645
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,279
OpenStack and those sorts of things

646
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,880
where effectively you had uh series

647
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,159
industry players who are using open

648
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,000
source to take away each other's

649
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,000
competitive advantages and by the time

650
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,240
you sum that up you end up with two

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,919
completely alternative approaches that

652
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,880
consumers or companies can choose to

653
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,279
use.

654
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,039
>> Um and I think that you know I think

655
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:01,360
open source is a kind of a um often you

656
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,320
know not considered enough as a as a

657
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,480
tool for shaping some of these technical

658
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,520
things. And I'm really struck by the the

659
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,559
long-term competition between

660
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,520
um kind of telco mobile, for example,

661
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,799
and Wi-Fi. Um you know, one comes from

662
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,279
the IT industry, one comes from the

663
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,440
telco industry. Uh they actually play

664
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,480
well together in some senses. And the

665
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,000
fact that they're different from each

666
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,679
other, got different stakeholders and

667
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,960
not converge is actually probably a good

668
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,840
thing going forward. We don't we

669
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,679
probably don't want Wi-Fi 12 and 8G to

670
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,600
become the same thing because we want

671
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,720
that kind of creative tension in there

672
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,480
that allows them to um you know most

673
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
most data that's carried over people's

674
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
devices actually goes through their

675
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,960
Wi-Fi in their homes not through the

676
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,080
mobile but the mobile the Wi-Fi doesn't

677
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,760
work when they're traveling around but

678
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,159
that creative tension has given us an

679
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,320
infrastructure that's kind of um so this

680
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,320
kind of what you lock down what you do

681
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,760
in terms of structures that of agreement

682
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,400
where you have open source in there to

683
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,080
do I think it's a really which if we can

684
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,400
keep that healthy, I think we're we're

685
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,320
in a in a in a good position. So,

686
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,760
>> but it is problematic how long sometimes

687
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,559
those solutions take to mature. And the

688
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,480
gap from a vision to

689
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,320
something like the phone in my pocket. I

690
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,840
mean, you know, it's regrettably long,

691
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,080
but maybe it has to be. Maybe that's

692
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,080
just reality.

693
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,000
>> Yeah. So I was I shouldn't be

694
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,960
interfering as as the moderator but as

695
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
um David talked about David K

696
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
earlier on. Yeah.

697
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,120
>> Um and I was at an event yesterday where

698
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,360
he spoke. So he was um Xerox Park early

699
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,799
on involved in the early definitions of

700
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,279
what it would mean to have a personal

701
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,880
computer and hence the need to kind of

702
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,159
integrate those. And I think they were

703
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,120
saying or he was saying when they

704
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,480
started work on that um they accepted

705
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,640
the fact that the industry was building

706
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,600
mainframes and what they were doing was

707
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,919
15 to 20 years out from what could be

708
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,360
achieved at commercial scale and then he

709
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,360
was working with Nicholas Negroponte who

710
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,840
was then in the architect machine group

711
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,919
who was trying to say okay 15 20 years

712
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,600
out from that what will that mean for

713
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,200
the way we use it and these kind of like

714
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,120
as you say the societal implications

715
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,039
side of things. So at one end you've got

716
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,120
somebody going okay this is the raw

717
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,559
technology we've got can we design a a

718
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,159
pipeline to get us halfway there and

719
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,440
some of the other end saying what are

720
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,360
the social outcomes we want what are the

721
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,360
economic outcomes we want what literacy

722
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,640
outcomes we want and those intention

723
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,080
really gave this kind of really

724
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,559
fantastic but you're right it was a

725
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,880
40-year journey between what Nicholas

726
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,960
was saying at the for you know the early

727
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,919
stages of the art group up to these

728
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:37,600
things turning out in people's homes

729
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:39,600
>> in 196 60 I think eight

730
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,000
JCR Licklider and Bob Taylor wrote a

731
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,960
paper. Taylor went on to run Xarks Park

732
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,840
and Licklider was a psychologist but he

733
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,799
was at DARPA. Why did hire Why did DARPA

734
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,480
hire a psychologist? Duh.

735
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,480
And they wrote a paper talking about

736
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,039
what the online experience might be.

737
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,600
And they were techno optimists, but boy,

738
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,200
they nailed it. You know, it's not like

739
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
they were completely offtarget. They

740
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,679
they really saw it is possible to look

741
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,600
into the future and say, you know, it

742
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,520
might grow up like this. It might do

743
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,919
this. It might do this. Uh it's worth

744
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,440
finding that paper. It's fun.

745
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,159
>> So, so just follow that through then.

746
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,559
So, if you were to look out 40 years,

747
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,520
what would you want the worked society

748
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,360
to look like? And what technical or what

749
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,200
technical and money routing things do we

750
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,520
knew do we want to do that we you know

751
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,520
to get us there or has all the the

752
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,120
difficult heavy lifting been done and

753
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,880
now it's just about funding innovation

754
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,880
ecosystems that build the right apps to

755
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,360
solve these things you know is is there

756
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,919
a personal computer out there that we

757
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,919
need to move towards

758
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,840
I mean I don't think we'll be using

759
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,440
phones be probably talking you know with

760
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,640
a chip in your

761
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,039
directly.

762
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,080
>> It's a worrying concept.

763
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,960
>> And who controls that chip?

764
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,360
>> Who controls the chip?

765
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
>> Yeah.

766
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
>> Who's in charge?

767
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,039
>> So, I was going to throw another one.

768
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,880
What the question about? So, one of the

769
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,120
the big issues that's obviously always

770
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,360
in the background is security.

771
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,440
>> Um, you know, the security of networks,

772
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,120
the role of networks in security in

773
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
various forms in terms of kind of supply

774
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,559
chain security, in terms of cyber

775
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,399
security, etc. you know, I don't know if

776
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,159
any of you got any thoughts around, you

777
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,559
know, uh, where that's going. You know,

778
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,919
for example, with aviation, uh,

779
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,720
presuming that must be a kind of, you

780
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,159
know, a challenging security, uh,

781
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,159
environment with people plugging random

782
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,480
things into their USB ports and tweaking

783
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,399
their RS232s and all that kind of stuff.

784
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,480
>> Yeah. So, great question.

785
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,480
So, I I'll I'll stay clear of people

786
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,880
plugging things in on the Wi-Fi network

787
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,080
because we don't do that. Uh, our

788
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,360
company doesn't. Uh so uh some of our

789
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,520
competitors do um but security is a big

790
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,440
issue for aircraft especially as you're

791
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,520
building more and different types of

792
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,399
networks. So the industry has defined

793
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,919
four security assurance levels. I don't

794
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,520
know if many of you are familiar with

795
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,679
something called a design assurance

796
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,159
level uh which is very common in

797
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,120
aircraft. So you have a DA you know DAL

798
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,600
1, DAL 2, D three, D four and D five.

799
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,760
And the lowest design assurance level

800
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,559
basically doesn't need much in terms of

801
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,760
certification. Whereas the highest like

802
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,880
a cockpit system uh for the flight

803
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,240
management is typically a DA one. Okay.

804
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,039
So similarly the security industry and

805
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,520
the regulators have defined four

806
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:40,720
security assurance levels. So it goes

807
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:44,000
from SL 0 to S 3 and depending on which

808
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,279
application it is and and so on you need

809
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,519
to pick a S and justify that you need to

810
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:55,039
be in that cell because many of us will

811
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,960
probably go towards S zero and somebody

812
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,240
in the cyber security office is going to

813
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,120
say no no that's a S 3 right so there's

814
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,720
going there's there's tension between u

815
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,600
different groups But so

816
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,679
in short so we've started addressing

817
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,000
that uh from a standardization and a

818
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,240
product perspective to say that if

819
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,440
you're bringing a new system on board

820
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,679
then you need to do this um within our

821
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,679
company itself we have to go through um

822
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,600
security readiness check whenever we are

823
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,679
defining new products or when we are

824
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,960
redesigning an old product because of

825
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,279
whatever reason um and we have to go

826
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,600
through the security it's it's a risk

827
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,559
analysis basically before we move

828
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,880
forward with it.

829
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,720
>> Excellent. So Sh you you you're like on

830
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
the hardware side of security to intent

831
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,360
purposes you're building hardware that's

832
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,559
intrinsically

833
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,640
>> Yeah. more secure.

834
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,440
>> Yes. The security on the hardware side

835
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,440
is like well a high power microwave can

836
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,279
blow out all your uh your front end. You

837
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,080
know you can get jammed and spoofed and

838
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,880
your vehicle can be captured and then

839
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,320
all everything that you know everything

840
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,440
that is secret is now exposed to your

841
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,559
enemy. Um so there are different levels

842
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,640
on on the pure hardware side uh that you

843
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,640
have to be concerned about with virus.

844
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,120
So Dave, what's the security assurance

845
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,279
level of the internet? I don't even

846
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,480
think about that. What's the security

847
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,919
level for the for social media?

848
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,360
Z minus three or something.

849
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,279
>> Yeah. [laughter]

850
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,279
Yeah. I mean

851
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,279
again

852
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,200
the question is who accepts the

853
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,600
responsibility for what

854
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,399
>> and

855
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,679
it's in if it's in some if it's a

856
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,039
centralized solution and it's in

857
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,159
somebody's business interest or they're

858
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,159
being regulated then then you know

859
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,919
they'll at least sort of like maybe on

860
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,440
Tuesdays try um

861
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,240
but

862
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,879
Security is the enemy of moving fast

863
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,480
and certainly in avionics I mean the

864
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,679
rate at which you or and and medical

865
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,359
systems the rate at which you can roll

866
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,000
out new systems because of the

867
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,240
requirements for testing and so forth

868
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,320
and somebody who's in a competitive

869
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,639
marketplace and wants to get a product

870
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,320
out there. The thing they know is

871
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,280
slowing down to make it secure means you

872
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,560
fail. It's just a horrible dynamic. So

873
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,919
they'll come around and try to put the

874
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,760
security in later and well that doesn't

875
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:41,919
work. So it's a nasty dynamic. So were

876
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,079
the were you know the the security

877
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,760
problems that mattered in the the

878
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,839
internet at large the ones you thought

879
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,000
were there early on or are they are they

880
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,720
emergent properties as people layer

881
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,280
these applications on top of this really

882
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,960
generative infrastructure that's enabled

883
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,440
by the the internet and then the web on

884
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
top of it and then the

885
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,839
so you can't predict them in advance in

886
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
some sense.

887
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,320
>> Well as I said I'm frustrated by the

888
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,079
insecurity of the global routing

889
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,200
protocol and it's insecure for a good

890
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,760
reason.

891
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,280
We understood

892
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,040
that it was possible to build a secure

893
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,040
routing protocol. Woman named Radio

894
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,320
Pearlman wrote a thesis in 1988 that

895
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,000
showed how to do it, but it used public

896
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,119
key crypto. We weren't allowed. Um,

897
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,880
but obviously if you listen to the news

898
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,560
today, most of the things that get

899
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,800
people's attention are the internet as a

900
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,440
vector for the penetration of an end

901
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,839
node. And uh we actually debated that in

902
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,760
the early days of the internet.

903
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,160
It was a very interesting conversation

904
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,000
because you know people say bunch of

905
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,680
academics designing the internet didn't

906
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,520
care about security. [snorts]

907
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,440
We had a guy from NSA on all our design

908
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,560
committees. Okay. He just made sure we

909
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,200
didn't make it secure. But

910
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,119
>> I'm not joking.

911
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,960
>> Anybody's listening? Yeah. But

912
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,640
we talked to NSA about whether the

913
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,480
network in their view whether the

914
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,560
network should have a responsibility for

915
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,400
protecting the host and they say we

916
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,760
don't trust the network and because we

917
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,280
don't trust the network we can't trust

918
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,560
the network to protect itself. So the

919
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,560
net protects the net and the host

920
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,240
protects the host design it on that

921
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,720
basis.

922
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,079
Well, we did. And I I'll tell a quick

923
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,720
story, but I don't want to take up too

924
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,880
much time, but the day the Robert

925
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Morris's worm or virus got loose on the

926
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,040
internet and it sort of got into a whole

927
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,400
bunch of machines. I was funded by DARPA

928
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,320
and uh my phone rang and I picked up the

929
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,240
phone and it was my it was the guy at

930
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,839
DARPA that was funding my research.

931
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,359
That's a military guy. Um this is a

932
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,079
test. Who lives in the real world? What

933
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,079
question did he ask me?

934
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,000
Nobody has an answer.

935
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
>> What?

936
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,240
>> Oh, no, no, no. His question was, "What

937
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,720
am I supposed to tell my commanding

938
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,320
officer?" [laughter]

939
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,839
>> And I told him, "The internet performed

940
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,720
a card to the degree specification. It

941
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,160
delivered the virus to [laughter] as

942
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,880
many machines as it could, as fast as

943
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,599
possible. Thank you."

944
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,040
And there was a long pause, but you

945
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,680
know, that was the division of that was

946
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,280
what we agreed on. And NSA very quickly

947
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,079
figured out that that didn't work. So

948
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,359
they created secure enclaves in which

949
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,640
they all trusted each other and then

950
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,240
they had encrypted channels between

951
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,079
them. And so parts of the net were

952
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,160
trusted and part weren't. But they

953
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,720
we had to

954
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,920
we did not have in the early days a

955
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,400
threat model. We didn't have a sense of

956
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,160
how to modularize the solution. We were

957
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,920
really feeling around in the mud. It was

958
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,440
a but we knew it was a real issue. Um,

959
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,880
we just didn't we just had to learn how

960
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,280
to think about it and they didn't know

961
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,040
how to think about it either.

962
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,599
It was too young. It's just confusing.

963
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,880
>> So, do you think we really have a a good

964
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,960
threat model for the worked world or is

965
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,440
it still too turbulent and too much a

966
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,520
kind of, you know, new actors actors

967
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,800
coming in that it's a

968
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,560
>> I don't want to be the only one to

969
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,240
answer here. The more complicated the

970
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,440
thing you build, the more modalities for

971
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,960
hacking it has.

972
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,680
>> Yeah, that's right. You want to chip in

973
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,079
on that.

974
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
>> What?

975
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,839
>> Anybody want to chip in on that?

976
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,280
>> No, totally. That's um

977
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,760
>> unonymity.

978
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,800
>> Sorry.

979
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,000
>> Unonymity.

980
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,920
>> Yeah, I mean like you know any any Yeah.

981
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,680
I mean anywhere you can as you know as

982
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,079
you build um more functionality anywhere

983
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,640
you can get in that's that's that's the

984
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,839
way to do it.

985
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,359
>> I think one one thing I would add to

986
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,520
that is that talking to some of the

987
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,880
people that kind of built some of the

988
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,240
social networking systems and those

989
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,880
sorts of things. I don't think anybody

990
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,160
who was building those really thought

991
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,800
that they would become the um the

992
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,880
playing field for nation state

993
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,480
information warfare in the way that they

994
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,320
did. I think we we built things like

995
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,720
Wikipedia and things. I think we really

996
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,160
did think that the best arguments would

997
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,480
rise to the top. And I don't think we

998
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,119
really understood that by opening these

999
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,320
things up and making them globally

1000
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,160
important, we would invite actors in uh

1001
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,599
that would behave at nation state levels

1002
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,119
in ways that we didn't expect. I think

1003
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,720
we we we honestly thought that would

1004
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,760
happen at a lower level. And that came

1005
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,599
as a bit of a surprise.

1006
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,599
>> Absolutely did not understand that. I

1007
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,119
mean Facebook thought the early days

1008
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,599
they thought the whole world would put

1009
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,560
their stuff online and share everything

1010
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,440
and then you know

1011
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,599
>> and it would all be fun

1012
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,720
>> and became a vector for like controlling

1013
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,599
you know uh elections

1014
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,280
>> and I think that's so just one one

1015
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,320
question as we finish up then so is that

1016
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,160
is this so if we do have these emergent

1017
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,400
properties of these systems as we build

1018
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,160
them that are um destabilizing at a

1019
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,240
large scale either or at a personal

1020
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,200
scale in families is or you know how do

1021
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,599
we think about that kind of managing

1022
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,000
this relationship between technology

1023
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,839
norms laws and economics in ways that

1024
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,240
gives us some kind of sense of getting

1025
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,160
to the social outcomes that we want and

1026
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,680
the economic outcomes we want from these

1027
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,400
very very powerful generative

1028
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,400
technologies.

1029
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,160
I mean, I think I see at least in the

1030
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,880
government side, I see uh they're going

1031
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,760
backwards to older systems because now

1032
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,400
no one has them. So, [snorts] they can

1033
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,520
use them and not be um

1034
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,200
>> coals backed.

1035
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,359
>> Yeah.

1036
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,920
>> Well, you got RS232 lurking around. So,

1037
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,200
that's a good sign.

1038
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,119
>> You have canvas.

1039
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,200
>> Yeah. [laughter]

1040
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,640
>> I think I think it would be interesting.

1041
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,599
I think there's an interesting exercise

1042
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,640
to go through. There are two,

1043
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,200
if I avoid saying the word AI.

1044
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,560
There are two scenarios for a new social

1045
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,000
experience that we could talk about. One

1046
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,720
is pure multi-person virtual reality.

1047
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,240
That's the metaverse, which Meta tried

1048
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,599
out briefly and then decided was not a

1049
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,960
good idea. And I like to remind people

1050
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,079
it was invented by a science fiction

1051
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,760
writer,

1052
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,839
>> William Gibson.

1053
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,640
And the other is augmented reality where

1054
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,400
you look at the world and you're looking

1055
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,079
through some sort of glasses and so you

1056
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,200
see some sort of overlay on the real

1057
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,599
world. And and I think you could examine

1058
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,319
both of those through the lens of who

1059
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,280
would control it, who can manipulate it.

1060
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,200
Um when I look at the world through my

1061
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,079
augmented reality glasses, am I going to

1062
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,119
see the world plastered with ads?

1063
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,040
You know, um and who gets to put the ads

1064
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,599
there? What am I seeing when I look at

1065
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,960
the world and who controls it? And I I

1066
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,640
think you could at this point we

1067
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,400
understand enough about abusive behavior

1068
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,839
that you could you could you could

1069
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,440
probably get a bunch of scenario

1070
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,359
planners together and say how would

1071
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,920
those how would those play out as they

1072
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:42,000
grow up and and ignore the fact that

1073
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,160
meta, you know, but that's all right. Um

1074
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,800
I I

1075
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,160
this idea of seeing this is a very small

1076
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,319
digression, but it really just sort of

1077
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,359
oh my god that's the future. I don't

1078
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,480
know how many people like to watch

1079
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,960
hockey here, but if you if you watch a

1080
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,480
hockey game, you will notice two things.

1081
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,800
And one of them is the boards, which

1082
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,920
used to be white, you know, they have

1083
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,359
ads on them, right?

1084
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,079
The ads are now being digitally

1085
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,440
overlaid. Okay. Um, from one camera, the

1086
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,440
other cameras show the original boards

1087
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,200
which have ads on it. And then on the

1088
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,154
glass, that's what, you know, the puck

1089
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,280
stopping glass, you see ads. Those

1090
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:20,319
[snorts] are being digitally put there.

1091
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,599
Obviously, we're on the glass. There

1092
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,960
would be people behind the ads that

1093
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,800
would be pissed off because they

1094
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,440
couldn't see anything. So, they are

1095
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,680
overlaying ads

1096
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,200
on to the surfaces of the rink.

1097
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,800
And they said, "Oh yeah, we make a lot

1098
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,240
more money." I asked about this because

1099
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,240
even though I was watching a game last,

1100
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,480
my son is a total hockey freak. We were

1101
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,119
watching a game that was in Ottawa, but

1102
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,920
the ads that were on the boards were

1103
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,400
Boston ads. Boston was injecting had

1104
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,160
bought the rights to inject the ads onto

1105
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,920
the digital version for the Boston

1106
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,040
audience. And I said, "Okay, that's

1107
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,240
augmented reality. That's what it's

1108
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,520
going to look like. [sighs]

1109
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,119
It's all over. It's going to look like

1110
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,640
ads. It's nothing but ads placed on and

1111
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,880
everything. Stop. Take the glasses off.

1112
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,599
Throw them away."

1113
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,079
So I don't know with any last questions

1114
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,839
or with that I'll ask for any final

1115
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,280
comments from the the audience about you

1116
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,040
know kind of whe you think it's that

1117
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,480
optimistic future for communications

1118
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,160
network and its implications or whether

1119
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,680
we're going down David's dystopian view

1120
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,000
of advertising kind of everywhere. So I

1121
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,319
think um Sanjay you want to just wrap us

1122
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,160
up first.

1123
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,079
>> Oh I'm optimistic. I think uh the things

1124
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,760
that are yet to be invented and

1125
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,920
innovated and so on and u the future

1126
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,720
is a lot brighter than a pessimist would

1127
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,119
like to define it and I am at times

1128
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,040
pessim pessimistic because like oh you

1129
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,319
know saying that the light at the end of

1130
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,240
the tunnel's been turned off kind of

1131
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,880
thing. No I think there's there's more

1132
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,200
to it.

1133
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,200
>> Some days I'm optimistic. Um, I think I

1134
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,839
think um

1135
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,319
I'm optimistic about technology, but I

1136
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,079
don't know about the the combination of

1137
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,920
everything put together whether it's

1138
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,920
it's optimistic.

1139
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,920
>> David,

1140
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,440
>> did you want me to vote on the

1141
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,560
optimistic spectrum? [laughter]

1142
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
>> No, in some respects I'm very

1143
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,359
optimistic. You know, I think the

1144
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,960
internet's been a tremendous force for

1145
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,800
good. And um

1146
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,520
you know, I don't know whether you could

1147
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,040
find somebody who said,

1148
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,560
"Yeah, if I had to do it again, I

1149
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,960
wouldn't.

1150
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,599
I don't think so. We just need to figure

1151
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,319
out how to rein in some of this

1152
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,480
stuff." That's going to be hard because

1153
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,880
they're powerful actors.

1154
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,560
And I I just add this like um to my

1155
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,400
sense when when I go around campus

1156
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,560
meeting with the various researchers

1157
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,240
pretty much everything we touch on there

1158
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,480
seem to be several orders of magnitude

1159
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,800
of improvement to come. And when we've

1160
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,920
been talking about things like um AI

1161
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,200
everyone say it's going to melt the

1162
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,560
world but you talk to different

1163
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,640
researchers there's hardware that's

1164
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,079
going to be a thousand times more uh

1165
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,200
energy efficient. There's software that

1166
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,800
could be a thousand times more

1167
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,079
efficient. There's systems that can be

1168
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,960
built that are a thousand times bigger.

1169
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,880
So we we're really still only partway

1170
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,079
through this kind of explosion of these

1171
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,960
very very large scaleworked

1172
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,400
intelligent computationally rich systems

1173
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,119
and so these kind of questions about how

1174
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,480
we think these things through um and get

1175
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,319
some at least some of the outcomes we

1176
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,160
want I think are becoming are going to

1177
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,119
remain really pressing for us. So with

1178
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,720
that I wanted to thank the panel um and

1179
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,416
for everybody for for joining us for the

1180
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,436
session. So thank you.

1181
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,436
[applause]
