70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,640
like to give you a sampling of some of

71
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,280
our varied research

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
discovered a new photo molecular effect

85
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,159
that offers promise for decreasing the

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,239
energy needs for

87
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,360

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,799
photo molecular evaporation rate that

90
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,519
can exceed pure thermal evaporation by

91
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,000
about 10

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,400
times Professor Patrick Doyle is

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,200
currently spinning out a new technology

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
that can remove micropollutants from

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,319
processed water he initially developed

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,480
the technology with a jwa seed Grant and

97
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,439
is currently commercializing it with a

98
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,599
grant from our Solutions program the

99
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,599
technology makes use of hydrogel micr

100
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,560
particles and can be customized to

101
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,560
remove specific

115
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,080
addressing the need to generate more

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,919
genetic diversity and crops such as

117
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,600
pigeon pea a major source of protein and

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,520

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,680
salinity and Heat stress two major

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,080
challenges with climate

124
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,600

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,919
initiative are looking into the

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,280
relationship between the mining industry

130
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,280
and water use climate change and the

131
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,319
agricultural communities that depend on

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,000
the glacial environment in

133
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,000
Chile the project will produce findings

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,600
that can be used by communities

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,520
government and Industry to reduce the

136
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,680
negative impacts of Mining and climate

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,800

177
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,080
and the researchers to define the

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,759
proposed scope and budget and facilitate

179
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,199
