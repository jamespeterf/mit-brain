1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,319
So I'm Yaniv, CEO and founder of Alpha

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,360
Biome. Uh I'm also a researcher at MIT

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,920
and uh for the past 20 years I've been

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,880
um looking at how AI can be used in

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,880
order to find order in the chaos. Uh so

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,039
this is what we are doing at Alpha

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,519
Biome. Uh we are using um this

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,760
technology in order to revolutionize the

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:31,199
way biomarkers are being discovered and

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,239
uh commercialized. Um, quickly what are

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,360
biomarkers? Biomarkers are the signals

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,320
that our body leaves behind. These are

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,920
tiny genetic fragments that can be used

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,120
in order to predict the development of

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,600
diseases. They can be used to diagnose

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,760
the medical condition and they can be

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,840
used in order to determine what is going

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,680
to be the most effective treatment. Now

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,920
these less biomarkers are of extreme

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,720
importance not just to patients but also

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,159
to pharma companies who pay hundreds of

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,159
millions per each. And the reason is

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,799
that they are of immense value both for

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,520
patients of course that can benefit from

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,840
the best treatment but also they are the

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,960
key for pharma in order to both extend

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,640
the patent exclusivity for their

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,520
existing drugs uh by detecting a cohort

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,799
of likely responders as well as for

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,720
developing a new kind a new generation

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,000
of drugs And this is a $50 billion

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,960
market. There are dozens of deals every

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,079
year where biomarkers are being

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,680
purchased uh across many different

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,360
therapeutic areas from oncology uh to

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,759
degenerate nervous systems uh gastro um

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,759
and others. Now, all of these

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,320
biomarkers, there is one thing in common

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,960
to them, and that is that they are

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,080
mostly coming from the host genome, the

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,480
human DNA. Um, you're looking for a

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,400
mutation, a bad corrupt gene, and so on.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,599
And this is what the vast majority of

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,280
the biomarkers are based on. And we do

45
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,400
something profoundly different. We can

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,879
detect biomarkers from the microbiome.

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,120
These trillions of creatures living

48
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,959
inside us. and on our bodies. And um we

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,480
have already discovered more than

50
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,879
100,000 novel biomarkers that can be

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,800
used to predict efficacy of drugs um

52
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,480
using our proprietary technology and um

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
these are all coming from the

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,440
microbiome. We spent two years proving

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,760
that these biomarkers are actually of

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,319
value to predict drug efficacy. We did

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,319
it on cows on animals. This was the

58
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,360
largest the world's largest clinical

59
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,920
study where we use these technology and

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,200
these biomarkers in order to predict

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,920
drug efficacy for cows. There are drugs

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,319
for cows. Uh and we demonstrated that we

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,440
can triple the effect of these

64
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,080
commercially available leading drugs. It

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,159
was demonstrated on 30,000 cows all

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,319
around the world. It was published in

67
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,040
already several uh peer-reviewed

68
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,120
scientific studies. And a year ago we

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,239
expanded to humans demonstrated the same

70
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,599
thing. We can predict efficacy for drug

71
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,680
uh for IBD patients Crohn's and colitis

72
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,920
going from 32% efficacy to 67. So

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,200
doubling the efficacy for humans real

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,480
data real patients. Um we signed an

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,959
agreement to get this IBD data but also

76
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,280
recently signed another agreement to get

77
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,360
similar data for childhood obesity and

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,080
topic dermatitis. Uh and we're looking

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,319
for partnerships with pharma companies

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,959
with um blockbusters that are looking

81
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,519
for biomarkers with insurance providers

82
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,599
and payers who look um to optimize

83
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,239
treatments for their patients uh

84
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:11,519
focusing mainly Europe, US uh Japan,

85
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,519
Korea and Singapore. So thanks
