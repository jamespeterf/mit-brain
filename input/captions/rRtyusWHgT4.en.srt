Department of aeronautics and

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,789

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,560
it's an annual lecture on history of

9
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,590
aerospace a garden was a graduate of

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,390
class of 98 we should not have to

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,390
distinguish but say 1898

12
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:42,350
century as best I can figure out he was

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,370
basically a buddy of mine suckers is

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,289
that right does anyone remember this one

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,649
super state that have this network of

16
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:55,430
buddies who were influential and being

17
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:59,629
at money as the huge that comes across

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,309
and Gardner was one of them he was they

19
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,920
published a magazine for a number of

20
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:07,060
years called aviation and aeronautical

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,869
engineering he was a decorated officer

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,750
aviation officer World War one and

23
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:17,080
he was fun that allows he

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,630
of this lecture

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,850
which is a prestigious list of lectures

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,650
I'll just read a few off of the previous

one of our alumnus Joe Gavin not only

34
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:55,230
alumnus very active supporter of the

35
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:58,390
department Joe received his SP in 1941 a

36
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:01,340
member of the famous class of 41 it

37
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,020
included Jimmy Maher

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,240
a few other people who were quite active

39
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,240
are who else is in the classical

40
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:15,090
long time ago 55 years ago he was in the

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,250
Naval Reserve and served in the Bureau

42
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,500
of Aeronautics during World War two

43
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,440
it was a project officer from the Navy's

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,319
first jet fighter he joined Grumman

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,430
after the war and as a design engineer

46
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,980
and he served in many capacities there

47
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:34,440
including the one in which he will talk

48
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,200
about us today as he was a vice

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,910
president and director of the Lunar

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,920
Module program during the Apollo era

51
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,400
served there until his retirement in

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,959
1885 outside of Grumman he's had a lot

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,130
of influence on the nation of the world

54
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:54,420
a member of the devil a since 1946 which

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,250
was before it was to get away in 1982 he

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,239
was the president would be our

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,239
professional Society

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:08,160
before he's received the NASA

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,160
distinguished Public Service Medal and

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,580
remember me it's International Academy

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,580
of astronautics

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,189
was a director of the AAAS and became a

63
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,080
fellow of that evening

64
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:26,000
and in his spare time he's been active

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,610
here at the Institute as a member of the

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,010
educational council was the president of

67
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,599
the Alumni Association have served on a

68
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,849
number of visiting committees including

69
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,340
ours his life member of the corporation

70
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,079
and has served on its executive

71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,099
committee which is succeed a real

72
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,099
powered entity

73
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,560
so I would like to I

74
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,540
in fact to introduce you to give his

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,810
address on the technology and

76
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,930
programmatic development of the thank

77
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,930
you

78
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:09,299
well it's a very considerable honor to

79
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:12,989
join the group who have given this

80
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:16,739
lecture it also brings back a rather

81
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:19,410
strong pang of nostalgia now I have to

82
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,500
explain that it's a little hard to feel

83
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,710
nostalgic about ten years of sheer

84
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,740
desperation because that's about what it

85
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,590
was and I'm just going to hit some of

86
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,850
the high points here and I'll skip some

87
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:40,699
of the the real difficult times but you

88
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:45,110
know this program the Apollo program

89
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:49,470
started as a result I think of the

90
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,810
competition in the Cold War there were

91
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,160
many things that led up to it and I

92
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:59,400
would suggest that the beginnings of

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,410
NASA and the beginnings of Apollo are

94
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,950
worth reading up on because they're

95
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:08,340
quite complicated in my view one of two

96
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:11,729
major things mr. Eisenhower decided that

97
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:17,039
it was going to be a NASA was going to

98
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:19,560
be an open unclassified agency he

99
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,130
managed to fend off the Air Force who

100
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,210
wanted the job and then of course mr.

101
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,979
Kennedy made the commitment to do it at

102
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,810
the time that he made that commitment

103
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:36,630
one of his advisors was saying that with

104
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:41,190
the reliability available in components

105
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:44,570
at that time that it would take probably

106
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:49,979
40 landings 40 attempts to make a

107
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:52,470
successful landing well it turned out

108
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,080
otherwise of course and the credit

109
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,199
really has to go to an awful lot of

110
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,500
people you know I'm here today to tell

111
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,870
you as I remember it about the program

112
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,710
but there are an awful lot of people who

113
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,270
are involved at Grumman and it's

114
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,050
subcontractors at the various NASA

115
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,729
centers

116
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:20,259
and it's pretty hard to find any group I

117
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:23,860
think that worked as diligently and as

118
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:26,220
and as focused a fashion for those 10

119
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:35,190
years

120
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:35,190
well now let's get into the slides this

121
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:44,319
this particular slide is from Apollo 15

122
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,960
as I recall and the reason for showing

123
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,889
it is first of all it is on the lunar

124
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:55,509
surface and secondly the rover is is in

125
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:57,789
sight and this the last three lunar

126
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,449
modules had the ability to carry the

127
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:04,599
rover they had more oxygen more battery

128
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:10,090
power and could stay longer but let's go

129
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:12,370
back and see how it started the command

130
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,330
and service module got started but it

131
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:20,919
was many months later that the decision

132
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,960
was finally made to embrace lunar orbit

133
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,469
rendezvous this was something that John

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,349
houbolt promoted and looking back at it

135
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't think we would have gotten there

136
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,000
without that concept

137
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:42,050
so that was finally embraced I think in

138
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,870
July of 62 and then there was a

139
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:51,220
competition and it was an interesting

140
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:54,560
competition the Center at Houston asked

141
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,650
20 questions and you had to answer those

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,169
20 questions and not over a hundred

143
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,259
pages with print not below a certain

144
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:05,960
size and the idea was that if you knew

145
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:09,500
what you were doing it would show in the

146
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:13,370
answers to those questions well we we

147
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,970
did submit a proposal I'm not sure that

148
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,610
then senior management expected that we

149
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:25,969
would ever win anything but we had to

150
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:28,729
have a straw design in order to answer

151
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:32,419
the questions and this is what we had at

152
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:36,140
the time now this was a vehicle that was

153
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,779
going to be considerably lighter than

154
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,349
what eventually came out of it and it

155
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:44,810
had interestingly enough five landing

156
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,260
legs on the premise that if you broke

157
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,209
one it wouldn't tip over the other thing

158
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,680
that's interesting about this is that

159
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:56,300
there were two docking hatches and we

160
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:02,170
had reason to believe that that was an

161
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:05,570
advantage we had a helicopter like cabin

162
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:09,320
that didn't last long but the idea of

163
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:12,829
good visibility was there and I'll show

164
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,800
you and this shows that there was an

165
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:17,540
after equipment bag well we did have an

166
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,630
after Clinton Bay it didn't quite look

167
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:27,079
like that and then we'll jump right away

168
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:31,550
to what finally came out and this is

169
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:35,480
taken from Apollo nine the flight test

170
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,579
and Earth orbit and it's really upside

171
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,120
down but it's easier to understand this

172
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:43,699
way and here you can see the probes on

173
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,960
the landing gear there was great concern

174
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:50,080
that the dust on the surface the

175
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,200
obscure things to the point where you

176
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,520
needed some mechanical indication of

177
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,240
landing this also shows the the exhaust

178
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:05,920
bail of the descent engine and the

179
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:09,280
rather massive insulation around it up

180
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,190
at the top is the rendezvous radar there

181
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,400
was a flasher here which was the backup

182
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:18,550
means of rendezvous and in this picture

183
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,890
you really can't see the the two windows

184
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:25,420
because what we had done in developing

185
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:28,600
the cockpit arrangement was to turn the

186
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,910
the front of the vehicle inside out and

187
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,350
pull the windows right back to the

188
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:38,770
astronauts eye now you know we hadn't

189
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,500
been into this contract for more than

190
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,990
three months when we began to understand

191
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,690
what some of the priorities were now

192
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:51,960
this was a cost-plus incentive fee

193
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:54,280
contract and the incentives depended on

194
00:10:51,960 --> 00:11:00,250
performance which turned out to be

195
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:02,530
largely wait schedule and cost well I

196
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,690
think in about three months that came to

197
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:10,300
us that those things were not equal

198
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:13,600
performance was clearly number one we do

199
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,510
our best to meet the schedule and I hate

200
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,300
to say this Joe but we we really left

201
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:27,760
the cost to come third as he well knows

202
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:32,890
so but that was an important idea and it

203
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,980
took us about two years to firm up the

204
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:38,350
final design because at the time we were

205
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,150
in the competition we did not know for

206
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:45,280
example the details of the MIT designed

207
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,530
guidance system and then of course

208
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:51,280
though there were requirements like a

209
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:53,829
backup guidance system and so on well

210
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,249
let's go on

211
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:59,290
this is a I'm not sure which mission

212
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,360
this came from but this is the acid

213
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,639
stage and I picked this slide

214
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,129
particularly to show the rendezvous

215
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:11,980
radar the front door the the front

216
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:14,920
docking hatch that we proposed became a

217
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:18,369
door not a docking hatch and then this

218
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,619
is the asset engine exhaust here and

219
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:24,910
this gives you a pretty good idea of

220
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:27,819
where the propellant tanks for the acid

221
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:33,209
engine were it also shows clearly the

222
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:36,429
the quad reaction control thrusters

223
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:39,639
there were four on each of the four

224
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:42,850
corners of the vehicle it's also pretty

225
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:46,480
clear that this is not a very

226
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:50,439
aerodynamic vehicle you know to a group

227
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,829
of airplane designers this was a real

228
00:12:50,439 --> 00:13:00,040
awakening that we did not have to worry

229
00:12:53,829 --> 00:13:02,799
about conventional aerodynamics and it

230
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:09,119
became very utilitarian in the parents

231
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:09,119
and only its designers could love it

232
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:19,430
now at the time that we started not much

233
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,880
was known about the lunar surface in

234
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,290
fact there was a a well-known

235
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,090
astrophysicist from Cornell who said

236
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:31,490
look there's going to be 10 meters of

237
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:34,280
impalpable dust and not only will you

238
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,520
sink into it but electrostatically it's

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:41,600
going to swarm right up over the vehicle

240
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,790
well I think he told me that in 1965 by

241
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,380
which time we were reasonably committed

242
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:51,740
to the design and we didn't buy it and

243
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:54,950
fortunately he was wrong but we did we

244
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:58,310
did have a pretty conservative approach

245
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:03,640
to landing as you can see by reading

246
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:06,470
some of these things and you know

247
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,200
vertical 10 feet per second is a pretty

248
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,960
good jolt now if you land on an aircraft

249
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,140
carrier you worry about maybe 20 feet

250
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:20,420
per second but for a land-based airplane

251
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:22,130
that's not too unreasonable now - but

252
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,120
since we didn't know about the the

253
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:28,880
surface we made some very broad

254
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,360
assumptions we assumed everything from

255
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:37,040
landing on the equivalent of ice to

256
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:40,880
landing in for small craters ideally

257
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:46,310
located to trap all four landing gears

258
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:51,070
and we landed with various pitching

259
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:56,570
motions rolling motions going motions

260
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:59,000
uphill downhill and 400 runs later we

261
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,690
thought we had conservatively surrounded

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,240
this problem and as it turned out much

263
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,240
later we probably had over designed

264
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,890
now one of the things that that occurred

265
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,860
duelist not at the very beginning but

266
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:19,670
you know into it a few months was that

267
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,250
this vehicle only has to make one

268
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,140
landing now that's a revelation to to

269
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:31,500
somebody who's been designing airplanes

270
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:33,600
and so we decided that well this is the

271
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:39,590
the tip-over condition that we worried

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:43,740
about so the shop the shock absorbing

273
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:46,890
material is honeycomb aluminum honeycomb

274
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,230
and a billet and it's good for one

275
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,790
landing it will take the shock and eat

276
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:55,590
up the energy it does not rebound and

277
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:58,280
you can't use it the second time but of

278
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:03,050
course we're not using it a second time

279
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:06,650
now we in conventional aircraft fashion

280
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:10,740
ransom drop tests as soon as we had a

281
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:13,350
vehicle to drop and we hoisted up in the

282
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,650
hangar and got all the conditions just

283
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,160
right let it go and it came down with a

284
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:23,160
crash that was absolutely frightening

285
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:26,970
because all of the gauges in this

286
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:30,750
machine were much lighter than anything

287
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,130
we had experienced in aircraft and I'm

288
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,310
going to say a little bit about that

289
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:39,000
later that it made a terrible noise and

290
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:43,470
it made us so worried at a later date

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,250
about the flexibility that much later we

292
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:50,460
insisted on a drop test where we had all

293
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,800
of the wiring and electronics in the

294
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,980
vehicle to see whether the flexibility

295
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,580
of the vehicle would interfere with the

296
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,530
the electrical systems actually we

297
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,620
didn't find any electrical systems

298
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:07,440
system problems but we did find one

299
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,680
small mechanical problem that we had to

300
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,680
fix

301
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:26,220
now I'll add a few more points about the

302
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:28,679
landing gear we provided a a the ability

303
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,499
to absorb something like 30 inches of

304
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,470
travel in the landing gear I don't think

305
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:38,580
any of the actual landings used more

306
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,590
than 3 inches and by the time we we got

307
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,710
to this point we knew a little bit more

308
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:46,519
about the lunar surface the astronauts

309
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,700
had spent a lot of time in the simulator

310
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:56,549
figuring out how to fly it and what they

311
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:58,649
really wound up doing was to set a known

312
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:02,460
rate of descent on the autopilot and

313
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:05,549
then flied the Machine manually in the

314
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,460
other planes and that worked very well

315
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:09,990
and I think as a conclusion we could say

316
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,840
the landing gear was somewhat over

317
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:16,070
designed but this also shows one other

318
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:20,240
thing it shows that as ample clearance

319
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:23,789
between the descent rocket engine

320
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,820
exhaust bail and the surface and this

321
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:30,960
became critical later when we added the

322
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,539
lunar rover and the extended Stay time

323
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,679
provisions because we then had a heavier

324
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:42,090
vehicle and in order to get there with

325
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:47,070
the same amount of propellant we had to

326
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:49,860
extend this bail a few inches and it

327
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,590
turned out that that that was would work

328
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:56,249
and was acceptable and and that's what

329
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,340
we did now the other thing that came out

330
00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:02,639
of these landings is that unlike what

331
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,619
happens on the ground on earth here when

332
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:07,320
a vertical landing machine comes down

333
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,299
you have dust that starts out sideways

334
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,399
and then pretty soon you have billows

335
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,980
coming up because of the interaction

336
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:16,259
with the atmosphere along the moon there

337
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,659
is no atmosphere and what seems to

338
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:22,950
happen is that the dust takes off

339
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:26,820
horizontally and just goes out of the

340
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:29,130
picture so that the dust that we worried

341
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:36,540
about earlier wasn't that

342
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:40,470
much of a problem now one of our worst

343
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:44,610
problems it was with us every day for 10

344
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:52,260
years was the tendency of the vehicle to

345
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:55,620
grow and I think the significant point

346
00:19:52,260 --> 00:20:00,270
is from about here when the design was

347
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:03,420
finally pretty much finalized and then

348
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:07,220
we had to wait growth then we had a huge

349
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:10,680
effort huge and numbers of man-hours to

350
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:14,640
squeeze the weight out of it and then

351
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:18,900
over here in early 67 was the fire at

352
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:23,100
the Cape and that led to some tests with

353
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:28,500
a iron monster cabin and a variety of

354
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:32,970
other things to ensure that fire would

355
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:35,430
not occur inside the the reduced

356
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,400
pressure but pure oxygen atmosphere in

357
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:41,910
the cabin and so the weight went back up

358
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,470
again and then of course this represents

359
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:52,080
the addition of the rover and the

360
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:55,230
longest a time provisions to give you

361
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,520
some idea and cut the fireproofing

362
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:04,430
amounted to this is the back of a

363
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:07,950
circuit breaker panel and we have little

364
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:10,380
baggies or well we found of course that

365
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:14,250
the circuit breaker housings themselves

366
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,740
would burn so then what to do so we

367
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:21,720
created these little baggies that went

368
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:24,780
around that circuit breaker body and

369
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,000
then all of the other electrical

370
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,660
connections were covered with this

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:37,770
mud-like material I thought I'd never

372
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:40,680
forget its name but I have and it was a

373
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,190
very extensive redesign and I would say

374
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:53,139
that

375
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:56,529
we lost about a year at that point to

376
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:59,399
continue with the weight story these are

377
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:06,389
this is a picture of the ascent stage

378
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:08,169
tanks the historical they're very thin

379
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:15,460
proportionally they're thinner than

380
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:18,759
eggshells and they were designed on the

381
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,149
basis of fracture mechanics to be good

382
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,999
for no more than a hundred

383
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:29,139
pressurisation the propellants were fed

384
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:34,840
to the engines by pressure the pressure

385
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:37,989
on twas helium and so every tank had a

386
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,440
pedigree every test that was made was

387
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:44,230
recorded and we made sure that before it

388
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:49,529
went off in a on a mission that there

389
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:53,679
were an ample number of cycles left and

390
00:22:49,529 --> 00:23:00,210
this is a view of the descent stage tank

391
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:05,909
and this is similarly thin stuff in fact

392
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:08,950
we did a lot of our testing with referee

393
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:12,100
fluids in other words fluids that had

394
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:18,279
the characteristics of the nitrogen

395
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:21,730
tetroxide and the udmh but which were

396
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:25,149
not nasty to handle and we did a lot of

397
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:29,499
the testing with heavy weight tanks when

398
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:30,899
I received first light weight descent

399
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:34,359
stage tank

400
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:37,769
no of course we filled it check the

401
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:41,820
volume and consternation set in because

402
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:47,049
it held 26 twenty seconds more

403
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:48,730
propellant than we had counted on and so

404
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:51,129
then the question was did somebody make

405
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,779
a mistake well no they hadn't what

406
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,280
happened was that under the weight of

407
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:57,080
the propellant the tank stretched

408
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,140
and we were very happy to have that

409
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:05,320
extra 20 seconds with because if you

410
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:08,660
remember I'm Strong's lat first landing

411
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,180
he hesitated a bit to clear some

412
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,940
boulders that were that he was coming in

413
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,360
on and I think he was down to about 20

414
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:19,370
seconds at the time he touched down the

415
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,120
rest of us at Mission Control were blue

416
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,120
at that point

417
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,980
and while we're talking about tanks I'll

418
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:38,160
talk a little bit about one of our other

419
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:42,330
very major problems which crept up on us

420
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:46,550
so slowly that we didn't realize how bad

421
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:51,450
it was going to be but we had leaks now

422
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:54,180
nitrogen tetroxide is a nasty material

423
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,510
if it finds a small leak the small leak

424
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:00,360
soon gets to be a bigger leak and and

425
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:03,300
it's toxic so you really don't want a

426
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:07,320
leak and we had designed everything so

427
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:11,640
light and slender that we had leaks

428
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:15,090
around these ports at the bottom of the

429
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:19,230
particularly the descent stage tanks and

430
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:22,740
we we worked hard at this

431
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:25,860
in fact we wound up changing all the

432
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,980
seals and in fact one of the vehicles

433
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,760
that was already at the Cape had to send

434
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:36,360
back this whole lower structure so that

435
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:39,090
we could redo the seals it was a

436
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,090
terribly frustrating affair and we were

437
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:46,440
looking for leaks that were on the order

438
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:50,760
of one cubic centimeter per year

439
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:54,140
pretty small leak with jet fuel you

440
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,140
would never worry about that

441
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:08,840
well then this is a picture in a final

442
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:13,770
assembly area but we have an asset stage

443
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:17,850
that's being supported independently of

444
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:20,670
the descent stage and it shows you some

445
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:26,400
of the precautions we took with some of

446
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:30,660
the thinner gauge materials and some of

447
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:34,559
these structural gauges say in this

448
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:38,910
shear web we're really quite thin we got

449
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,250
down to ten thousandths we would Ken

450
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,110
milled out into ten thousandths and keep

451
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,679
the extra thickness around the edges

452
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,429
with it

453
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:50,100
where the connectors were and we tried

454
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:52,200
going to double oh eight and then we

455
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,370
counted the number of grains across a

456
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:00,780
double O 8 section and chickened out we

457
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:03,299
went to the ten thousands I might add

458
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,150
that weekend milled almost everything

459
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:08,429
you could think of propellant tubing was

460
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,480
chem milled keeping the original

461
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:15,690
thickness where the connectors work and

462
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:20,010
I have I can't offhand say how many

463
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:22,440
man-hours were expended in trying to

464
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:31,140
save weight but it was a large number

465
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:34,340
and it was an endless process now this

466
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:38,910
is a picture of the of the asset stage

467
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:42,990
in a sort of a stripped condition you

468
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:46,710
can see the acid propellant tank you can

469
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:49,320
see its support out here this is a good

470
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:54,960
picture of the window which is just

471
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:58,049
inches from the astronauts eye and you

472
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,990
can also see that we have the tanks

473
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:03,870
separate tanks for the reaction control

474
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:06,720
system and that was one system that was

475
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,460
completely redundant we had a set of

476
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,340
tanks on the either side of the machine

477
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:16,470
and these tanks were

478
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,269
positive expulsion in other words there

479
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,840
was a bladder in them that allowed the

480
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:24,720
pressure to surely drive the propellant

481
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,340
out and of course we used the reaction

482
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,549
control system not only from the

483
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,639
NuvaRing but to settle the propellant in

484
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:44,840
the main tanks before a main engine

485
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:48,629
firing now this is the next step in the

486
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,769
Assembly of the asset stage and for

487
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:53,419
those of you who are familiar with

488
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:56,549
airplanes this is an inside-out machine

489
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:59,909
in other words in an airplane you get

490
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:02,249
the sleek exterior and then you package

491
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:05,399
everything inside it as densely as you

492
00:29:02,249 --> 00:29:07,619
can as some people say so that even if

493
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:10,379
you dropped a broken egg into it it

494
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:12,269
wouldn't drain through but here we had a

495
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:17,249
machine that didn't have to be

496
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:21,809
aerodynamically slick so we built it

497
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:25,499
inside out much of the wiring practice

498
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:28,259
much of the equipment we're outside the

499
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:32,249
pressure vessel and you can see some of

500
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:34,979
the the wiring here and then on the

501
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:36,899
outside we were going to have a thermal

502
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:40,320
shield which also doubled as a

503
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:43,879
micrometeoroid bumper and that had to be

504
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:49,549
supported somehow and that led to this

505
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:55,710
birdcage like affair which supported

506
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:58,019
this skin now this you might ask well

507
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:02,299
how come some pipes of shiny and some

508
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:05,580
parts of black let me just say that a

509
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:10,229
very extensive thermal analysis was done

510
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:13,440
because we are trying to minimize the

511
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:16,019
power necessary in this vehicle to cut

512
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,799
down the the amount of batteries that

513
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,599
had to be carried and the amount also to

514
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,460
cut down the amount of heat that had to

515
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:29,370
be to put overboard

516
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:33,779
and this is the result of some tests in

517
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:40,049
both well analysis as well as tests and

518
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:42,830
a thermal vacuum chamber this is a

519
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:48,570
better view of the reaction control

520
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:53,159
thruster you see there for a similar

521
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:55,289
quad on each corner of the vehicle one

522
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,830
of the things that was added very late

523
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:02,820
in the game and which is not on my model

524
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:05,730
here is this shield which protects the

525
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,649
descent stage from the firing of the

526
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:12,120
reaction control thruster that's

527
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:14,600
pointing down this was the result of

528
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,789
some tests fairly late in the program

529
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:24,169
that were done on the reaction control

530
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:24,169
thrusters at the man Space Flight Center

531
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:34,169
this is another view of the final

532
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:37,559
assembly area this is an asset stage

533
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:40,200
that is substantially complete at the

534
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,419
front end but hasn't been all put

535
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,600
together on the back end and the reason

536
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:50,309
for showing this is to show you that the

537
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:55,429
equipment batteries radios were mounted

538
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:59,220
on cold rails the cold rails had glycol

539
00:31:55,429 --> 00:32:03,120
circulating in them the glycol heated

540
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:08,039
water the water went overboard through a

541
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:11,130
porous plate so that in effect ice was

542
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,049
formed and it sublimed into space and

543
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,179
that was the only way we could get heat

544
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:20,130
out of the vehicle if we had too much

545
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:24,600
heat this also shows some of the

546
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:26,909
paperwork the weight of the vehicle I'm

547
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,590
not sure whether it weighed more than

548
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:34,830
the paper or not but we had extensive

549
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:37,500
pedigrees on just about everything you

550
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,480
could think of and

551
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,769
that's a very important thing because

552
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:49,200
way back in the beginning we worried

553
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:51,779
about reliability at that time aircraft

554
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,440
experience was not particularly

555
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:58,019
attractive it didn't give you any great

556
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,889
assurance and one of our people came up

557
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:04,590
with the idea that there's no such there

558
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:06,870
should be no such thing as a random

559
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,960
failure if you have something that

560
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:13,559
doesn't work either a ground test or any

561
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,860
test you ought to be able to find out

562
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:20,580
what it is and fix it and in the course

563
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:24,809
of 10 years we had something over 14,000

564
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:30,000
such anomaly reports and I believe only

565
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:32,730
22 escaped satisfactory analysis in the

566
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,049
case of those 22 we changed something

567
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:40,289
anyhow and I think it was this attention

568
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:45,090
to the nasty little details that made a

569
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:49,350
difference I I've mentioned tests I

570
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:51,870
should point out that we couldn't flight

571
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:54,080
test this vehicle it's made only to fly

572
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,080
in space

573
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,240
we couldn't hot fire it because our

574
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,570
experience with the propellants was that

575
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:07,169
you really couldn't clean the system

576
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:10,050
adequately if you used it in other words

577
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:13,379
the propellants would tend to gum up the

578
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:16,319
solenoid valves and so forth so each

579
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:21,450
vehicle that was launched from Cape

580
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:25,980
Kennedy was an unused untested vehicle

581
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:27,929
in every sense except electrically we

582
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:32,010
were able to do a rather thorough job in

583
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:38,179
electrical check out but it did lead to

584
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:42,020
the prior the process of setting up a

585
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:46,349
very complex and I should tell you

586
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:49,490
steadily evolving ground test system so

587
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:51,409
that we could assure ourselves that

588
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:53,990
the equipment we were getting was good

589
00:34:51,409 --> 00:35:05,300
that it would work after it was in the

590
00:34:53,990 --> 00:35:08,559
vehicle and so on and so forth the now

591
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:14,329
this is a photo from the final assembly

592
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:17,720
area again showing a complete vehicle

593
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:20,960
except the landing gear here and the

594
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,140
same thing here and the point here is

595
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,400
simply that we were working toward a

596
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:29,960
three-month on center launch schedule so

597
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:39,290
we had to have these vehicles coming

598
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:43,220
along fairly regularly now this this

599
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:47,000
photograph shows the descent stage after

600
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:50,780
the landing gear is on the principle

601
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,740
reason for showing this is that we had a

602
00:35:50,780 --> 00:36:01,339
rather elaborate blanket of insulation

603
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:07,400
there to protect the descent stage when

604
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:10,400
the asset stage took off we tried to run

605
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:15,170
some tests in the vacuum chambers that

606
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:18,819
NASA had at White Sands and we could run

607
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:22,430
short bursts at different levels of

608
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:29,480
separation but we had no way of running

609
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:31,730
a truly dynamic test and in fact we

610
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:36,890
never really knew what happened until

611
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:39,500
the very last mission when the TV camera

612
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:43,130
on the rover was aimed at the take off

613
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,400
and while this is a still a lot of stuff

614
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:49,700
went flying out sideways from that

615
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:53,240
insulation blanket but the the vehicle

616
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:56,240
just pops up a set stage pops up now I

617
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,510
should point out that we have a

618
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,310
fly-by-wire vertical takeoff and

619
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:04,480
vertical

620
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:07,450
landing machine in the landing condition

621
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,780
it's like a transport because it's heavy

622
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,700
and when it gets back to dock with the

623
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,990
command module it's like a fighter

624
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:22,810
because it's gone through a ten-to-one

625
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:28,540
reduction and wait I've mentioned people

626
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:31,270
earlier and what I've said but it's

627
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,430
impossible to do credit to all the

628
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,780
people that were involved or for that

629
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,900
matter all the families that are

630
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:41,950
involved we worked a lot of people very

631
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,190
very hard and this is the checkout group

632
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:48,730
at the Cape and I'll read this for you

633
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:53,800
this is for the last mission this may be

634
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:56,590
our last but it will be our best and by

635
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:00,400
that they meant fewer anomalies to clean

636
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:07,120
up and of course the lunar module did

637
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:09,460
work and I think that I'd like to use

638
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,980
the view graph now for a minute we can

639
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:17,500
turn off the slides and talk a little

640
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:26,100
bit about something that I fell into by

641
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:26,100
accident namely management this is a

642
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:35,140
program organization chart something

643
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:38,500
that our customer really wanted they

644
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:41,410
wanted to know who was doing what and we

645
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,590
put this together now the trouble of

646
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:47,110
this is that this is a static chart it

647
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:50,410
suggests that all of the people at one

648
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:53,380
level are equal and I've sometimes

649
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:57,690
thought that an organization chart

650
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:00,370
should look like a slowly swirling

651
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:02,430
galaxy of stars some that are

652
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,830
brightening and some that are dimming

653
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:08,440
because the rolls tend to change as time

654
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:13,569
goes by the other thing that I would

655
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:15,489
point out is that these people never

656
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:19,959
admitted that they were on the third

657
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:23,199
level Grauman had a I think of peculiar

658
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:26,529
culture certainly in the time that I was

659
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:30,910
there in that everybody looked at the

660
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:33,640
company as my company and they were not

661
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,859
adverse to calling anybody up to tell

662
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,939
them what should be done differently or

663
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:41,410
what was going on and it led to a

664
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:46,739
certain amount of confusion sometimes

665
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:49,959
but the word got around very quickly so

666
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:52,410
and I will say that for many years the

667
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:55,569
company never had an organization chart

668
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:57,729
Roy Drummond founded the company was

669
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:02,339
agin it though he didn't have it for

670
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:06,400
many years the other thing that I would

671
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:08,170
point out here is how the manpower was

672
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,900
expended and there are a couple of

673
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:14,019
interesting points here we were always

674
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:19,299
under criticism for running too much

675
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:21,939
overtime but it's much more effective in

676
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:25,900
my view to run over time than to try to

677
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:29,229
add people in certain cases the other

678
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,609
thing we ran into us that these slopes

679
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:36,130
right in here

680
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:38,979
I think we're maximum achievable you can

681
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:44,999
bring people on board a major program

682
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:48,699
just so fast otherwise you you wind up

683
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:51,039
with people not being productive in fact

684
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:53,920
a good argument what happens in major

685
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:58,839
programs frequently is that the end date

686
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:02,529
or the the in this case the lunar

687
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:05,939
landing date was fixed and there's a

688
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:10,239
tendency for the start date to creep and

689
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:13,059
of course the effort is to build up as

690
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:17,559
fast as you can in order to get the job

691
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:23,529
done this slope right right about here

692
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:24,569
is seventeen hundred and fifty people

693
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:28,979
per year

694
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:32,819
now that's an instantaneous number but

695
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:36,479
at the real peak we're adding about

696
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:40,529
3,000 people a year and that comes about

697
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:45,299
because there's an acceleration involved

698
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:46,829
and by the time we got here in 265 we

699
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:49,739
thought we knew what we're doing and

700
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,289
could be bring people on board and this

701
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:54,209
is particularly true in bringing

702
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:56,959
subcontractors on board about half of

703
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:59,039
the effort I went to major

704
00:41:56,959 --> 00:42:03,779
subcontractors and some smaller

705
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:07,589
subcontractors this gap right here

706
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:10,380
represents the the effort to fireproof

707
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:15,119
everything that came after the fire at

708
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:18,150
the Cape and then you see we resume what

709
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,729
happens here of course is that there are

710
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,709
some things that you can stop and there

711
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:26,369
are other things that just have to keep

712
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:29,939
going so you can't really just come down

713
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:33,239
here somewhere and then of course once

714
00:42:29,939 --> 00:42:35,849
you have reached an Operations

715
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:38,900
operational stage things go downhill

716
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:38,900
pretty rapidly

717
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:56,000
I'd like to make a couple of summary

718
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:58,970
summary remarks we had the advantage of

719
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,340
a long-term commitment there are not

720
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:08,390
many programs that have had that kind of

721
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:11,270
advantage that I give mr. Craig Kennedy

722
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:14,810
great credit for having the gumption to

723
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:21,320
stand up and say before this decade is

724
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:23,210
out and so forth I think it was

725
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:28,670
important that we recognized our

726
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:31,610
priorities and in a highly technical

727
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:35,300
undertaking I think there's no question

728
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:36,290
in my mind the what you have to do the

729
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:41,240
job right

730
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:45,950
if you take shortcuts you pay more you

731
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:48,950
pay a larger penalty later I mentioned

732
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:53,000
the idea of no such thing as a random

733
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:55,550
failure it worked for us some of our

734
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,610
people who likened it to training every

735
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:04,130
stone on the beach over to see what was

736
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:06,140
under it it felt that way at times we we

737
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,310
invested a tremendous amount of effort

738
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,830
on the ground

739
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:12,710
simply because we couldn't flight-test

740
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:15,530
and some of those ideas went over into

741
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:18,640
our aircraft experience later on we

742
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:21,620
found we could save time and effort in

743
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,980
developing aircraft if we did more work

744
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:29,090
on the ground and didn't try to fly at

745
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:31,910
the earliest possible date it also

746
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:35,780
taught us what I called the basic

747
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:37,730
program dilemma and that is that if

748
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:42,920
you're going to do something truly

749
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:45,950
innovative you can't possibly know what

750
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:49,610
the schedule is and what the cost is

751
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:52,310
going to be and if conversely you know

752
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:54,890
precisely what the schedule is and what

753
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:57,000
the cost is you ought to stop and think

754
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:58,980
whether it's worth doing

755
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,260
because it may be obsolete before you

756
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:05,070
start now this is something I think

757
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:07,050
engineers understand quite well I've had

758
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:11,340
a terrible time with some congressmen on

759
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:16,260
that subject the other thing I'd mention

760
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:19,980
is that in being in in Europe and in

761
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,920
Japan and more recently in China the

762
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:25,290
impact of Apollo has been greater

763
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,470
overseas than it has been in this

764
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:31,109
country the American public is pretty

765
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:34,859
blasé about these things it's assumed

766
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:40,349
that you know the rocket scientists can

767
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:42,540
do anything well they almost can but the

768
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:47,190
American public passes on to something

769
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:50,730
else but we created a a reputation

770
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:53,099
overseas that people are still trying to

771
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:56,070
catch up with and I think this is

772
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:58,609
something that particularly those of you

773
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:04,700
who are students should understand that

774
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:04,700
the Apollo program was a tremendous

775
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:14,880
sales effort for American technology and

776
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:17,700
finally last comment a lot of people

777
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,190
talk about systems engineering it means

778
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,099
a lot of things to a lot of people in

779
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,710
some cases it's just a matter of do you

780
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:29,640
get all the interface signals correct

781
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:31,619
and so on but I think that anybody who's

782
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,020
associated with designing flying

783
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:37,160
machines whether they're flying in the

784
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:42,540
atmosphere or in orbit or out of space

785
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:45,510
really is faced with doing a superior

786
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:47,490
job of systems engineering and the

787
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:51,150
reason is that if you don't do a

788
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:55,470
superior job the results catastrophic

789
00:46:51,150 --> 00:47:00,180
and wind up on page one and you really

790
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:03,240
can't afford to have that happen I grew

791
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:07,530
up as an engineer and a company that was

792
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,700
run founded by a pilot and some years

793
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,990
where

794
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,020
some very senior pilots in the

795
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:18,160
management and the in the airplane days

796
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:21,280
would simply bring the pilot back one

797
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,670
way or another and we did that and I

798
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,980
think that if you have that in mind when

799
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:30,790
you're involved with designing flying

800
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:34,930
machines that you will do a superior job

801
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:37,079
of systems engineering now sometimes you

802
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:41,520
wonder well can you apply that to other

803
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:45,670
effort well in a selective way you can

804
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:49,300
those little US Postal Service trucks

805
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:52,270
you see running around the result of

806
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:55,270
applying some of the lessons that came

807
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:57,369
out of this program and that's a whole

808
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:59,430
nother story so I'll stop there and I'll

809
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:12,420
be happy to take any questions

810
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:12,420
[Applause]

811
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:29,280
well I can certainly tell you that if I

812
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:35,550
were doing today there's some things I'd

813
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:38,340
do differently at the time that we

814
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:40,550
designed the lunar module we were very

815
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:44,040
restricted on where we could use

816
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,960
solid-state devices in fact all of the

817
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:50,040
communication gear was made up of

818
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:53,090
discrete elements and I was certainly

819
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:59,600
avoid that that was a nightmare getting

820
00:48:53,090 --> 00:49:04,650
enough units that would pass tests I

821
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:07,320
would also have a digital data bus just

822
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:13,280
to reduce the miles and miles of wire

823
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:16,800
that we had we deliberately went to a a

824
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,500
skinnier gauge of wire than is commonly

825
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:23,640
used in aircraft in order to save weight

826
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:27,330
and we paid for it because we had ever

827
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:30,180
so many faults that came about from just

828
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:34,040
plane handling the bundles of wire so

829
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:37,080
anything he could do to get rid of the

830
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:45,540
old-fashioned way of wiring would be an

831
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:48,390
advantage I think that it's also quite

832
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:50,820
likely that a lot of the equipment that

833
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:55,290
we had well supposing we take the MIT

834
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:57,180
designed guidance some navigation

835
00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:00,660
equipment I think that could all be done

836
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:04,830
in a miniaturized version today that

837
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:10,550
would weigh a lot less I'm not sure we'd

838
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:14,460
had GPS in lunar orbit but I'm sure that

839
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:16,680
the what we had while it was great for

840
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,720
its time that's something we could do

841
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:25,790
much better today and that's probably

842
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,790
true of almost all the equipment Larry

843
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:38,359
not a word no I knew nothing about it

844
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,920
and I think I can safely speak for the

845
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:42,369
rest of the crew that we knew nothing

846
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,369
about

847
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:10,360
well you have to recognize that 40 years

848
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:15,520
ago I was a lot bolder than him today

849
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:18,280
and so were we all but there were some

850
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,280
lessons learned in simulation in fact

851
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,870
when we built the x29 a the little

852
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:28,540
airplane that had the forward-swept

853
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:31,720
wings and the huge negative stability we

854
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:35,170
treated that in simulation much as we

855
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,940
did the lunar module and the pilot came

856
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:40,050
back from the first flight and said gee

857
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:42,790
it flies just like the simulator so

858
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:47,740
there were some lessons learned during

859
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:50,950
the lunar module I crashed one of the

860
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:55,920
simulators several times for very simple

861
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:59,080
reason if you tried to translate in a

862
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,560
along the surface of the Moon there's no

863
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,090
air resistance so in order to stop you'd

864
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,480
have to fire in the opposite direction

865
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:08,770
you don't automatically slow down now

866
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,680
that's a thing that is so

867
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:19,180
counterintuitive that it takes training

868
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:22,110
to do to do well you were dealing with a

869
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,110
lot of different people

870
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:25,369
NASA

871
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:40,210
first of all how did you spend your time

872
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:42,580
what did you work with well I'll answer

873
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:46,270
the last one first every problem you

874
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:50,400
could possibly imagine in the very

875
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:53,130
beginning there was a certain resentment

876
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:58,750
among the dyed-in-the-wool

877
00:52:53,130 --> 00:53:03,640
aircraft people that this strange group

878
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:07,020
had brought home a a contract that was

879
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:11,080
going to take a lot of the company's

880
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:15,460
attention and people and reserves so

881
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:18,190
there was a matter initially of you know

882
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:21,250
getting the right people and fortunately

883
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:24,370
I had some excellent support from people

884
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:28,750
you know like grant Hedrick and from

885
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:34,210
them senior management and so we did we

886
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:40,170
did get the right people and of course

887
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:44,890
we we had to manage quite a number of

888
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:47,590
somewhat difficult subcontractors Joe

889
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,780
Shea remembers some of those days he and

890
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:54,570
I had a great debate one time walking

891
00:53:49,780 --> 00:54:00,760
along the street down at the Cape as to

892
00:53:54,570 --> 00:54:05,610
how much visibility the NASA people were

893
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:10,570
going to have into our subcontractors

894
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:12,730
and prior policy had been in dealing

895
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:16,360
with other government agencies is that

896
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:20,200
we would manage the subcontractors and

897
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:22,210
that was that we he won his point

898
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:27,310
finally and we came down to the idea

899
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:28,840
that NASA would have visibility as to

900
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:31,900
our relationships with the

901
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:34,840
subcontractors but they would

902
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:37,300
communicate to the subcontractors only

903
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,859
through us since we were the prime

904
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:45,970
contractor and we felt very strong

905
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:45,970
we had the the responsibility

906
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:58,110
I'm not sure I've answered that question

907
00:54:54,550 --> 00:55:01,330
adequately but that gives you some idea

908
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:03,460
yes what do you talk about 10 years in

909
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,980
lost although the most talkative agenda

910
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:08,470
as a transient stress can you share with

911
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:18,790
us the memory or two or the hollis for

912
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:20,890
me well well claude before i get to that

913
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:23,670
i want to go back to ball there's one

914
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:29,520
thing I forgot to say and that is that I

915
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:32,770
was very fortunate in having a had riyal

916
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:36,370
with whom I had worked for 10 to 15

917
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:39,550
years so we were we were pretty well

918
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:42,280
calibrated one to the other and not only

919
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:46,260
in the in the engineering into things

920
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,910
but I had a number of good acquaintances

921
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:54,370
amongst the technicians and the foremen

922
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:56,200
and every day that I was in Bethpage and

923
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:59,110
not travelling to Houston of some other

924
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:02,020
guidance lot I'd make it my business to

925
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:04,480
walk through the manufacturing area on

926
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:08,530
the test area and talked to the people

927
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,540
who were busy there and it's amazing

928
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:14,110
what you can learn just by taking an

929
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:16,600
hour's walk and seeing firsthand what

930
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:18,820
people are doing and what problems

931
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:23,230
they're having and some of the problems

932
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:26,140
are simple I recall one where the

933
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:30,280
thermostat on the heating system was

934
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:32,980
stuck and it was too hot and apparently

935
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,920
the foreman had complained nothing had

936
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:43,090
happened well I made a phone call it got

937
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:46,410
fixed so you know the problems range all

938
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:48,960
over the place I'll tell you that we did

939
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:52,150
occasionally have to send people home

940
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:55,750
because we discovered that some of them

941
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:58,540
were punching out at the end of their 10

942
00:56:55,750 --> 00:57:02,600
or 12 hour shift and then coming right

943
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:05,570
back in and working another few hours

944
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:10,250
and we we had some people who actually

945
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:13,280
made themselves ill in the process but

946
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:16,760
everybody knew what the name of the game

947
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:20,870
was and NASA did a great thing in having

948
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:23,990
the astronauts visit the plant oh I

949
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:27,560
think about every second a third week so

950
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:30,950
it became a question of we are building

951
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:34,310
this vehicle for someone we know not for

952
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:40,780
some agency that is a bunch of

953
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:45,920
bureaucrats somewhere now back to Claude

954
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:50,120
well the low point in in some days was

955
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,700
going to Houston to make a report on how

956
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,670
we were doing and having to get up there

957
00:57:52,700 --> 00:58:01,700
and say well we've lost another couple

958
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:08,000
of weeks and it's not easy but you know

959
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:11,050
that's the way things were and we did

960
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,550
what we had to I

961
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:18,260
speaking of Houston I remember one such

962
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:23,590
meeting where one of the fellows who was

963
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:26,630
involved in a navigation guidance group

964
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:28,730
was suffering from an earache and I

965
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:31,130
thought I had arranged it so that he

966
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:35,050
wouldn't go on that trip but he went

967
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:37,610
anyhow and he was under medication and

968
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:40,850
he got up to the podium to talk about

969
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:45,770
what they were doing and he was so

970
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:50,269
relaxed from the medication that he

971
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:54,359
created us sensational impressions

972
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:56,700
but he knew what he was talking about he

973
00:58:54,359 --> 00:59:03,630
got away with that and afterwards

974
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:05,519
somebody asked me what is he on but but

975
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:08,279
that was the kind of spirit that we had

976
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:15,410
in the group and gives you a couple of

977
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:15,410
ideas of what went on Earl

978
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:31,170
well that's a hard question to answer

979
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:35,250
the rule because you see I never became

980
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:41,210
an expert at anything but I do remember

981
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:44,609
very clearly professor Joe Newell who

982
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:47,670
taught structures and who was a very

983
00:59:44,609 --> 00:59:51,630
conservative man and when he went to

984
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:58,140
Washington he took the train and that

985
00:59:51,630 --> 01:00:04,859
made a great impression a great

986
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:07,589
impression yes when you comment it on

987
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:16,130
some of the things that might have

988
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:21,539
transitioned on maybe the success and

989
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:31,079
failures of translating the system into

990
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:35,940
the well the the question in case you

991
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:38,430
didn't hear it back there was we were

992
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,859
able to translate some of the systems

993
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:43,650
engineering aspects of handling the lamb

994
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:46,529
back into the aircraft business well you

995
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:48,690
have to realize that we took what we had

996
01:00:46,529 --> 01:00:52,200
learned in the aircraft business and

997
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:55,170
used it in the lamb and then of course

998
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:58,890
we had on-the-job training because we

999
01:00:55,170 --> 01:01:02,160
ran into so many difficulties and it is

1000
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:06,140
true that we didn't we did sharpen up

1001
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:12,660
the the aircraft business a bit after we

1002
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:19,980
space cadets took it over we instituted

1003
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:23,369
formal preflight reviews now they always

1004
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:26,400
had been some sort of review prior to

1005
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:31,619
flying a new airplane but nothing like

1006
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:33,860
what NASA had taught us to do so we

1007
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:43,050
introduced that

1008
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:45,600
we that stands out in mine and the

1009
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:49,050
simulation that in the simulation of the

1010
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:51,690
two big things you see at the time we

1011
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:56,610
were involved in seeing aircraft that

1012
01:01:51,690 --> 01:02:01,230
were very highly well had a lot of

1013
01:01:56,610 --> 01:02:08,210
electronics in them and where things

1014
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:11,720
like crosstalk and mutual interference

1015
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:19,620
had really been worked on very very hard

1016
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:23,340
so well we did also introduced the the

1017
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:27,780
matter of certifying the people who

1018
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:32,640
could open a connection now the with all

1019
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:37,620
those with all those prongs and a and a

1020
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:42,660
plug it takes real skill to avoid

1021
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:44,220
damaging it and that helped but I think

1022
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:48,270
that some of the aircraft we were

1023
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:50,070
building at the time were just as

1024
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:52,940
complicated in fact some of them were

1025
01:02:50,070 --> 01:03:00,420
more complicated than the lunar module

1026
01:02:52,940 --> 01:03:05,040
as I recall the the C the ea-6b had

1027
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:10,010
something like eighty antennas on it so

1028
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,010
that was not all that easy either
