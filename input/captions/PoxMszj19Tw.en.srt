1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,400
Now there's a third example which is

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,160
quite interesting which is sometimes

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,280
cartels can operate in the open and get

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,320
away with it. Let's talk about the

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,240
National Football League. The NFL. The

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,240
NFL is the most important football

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
organization in America. The most

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
profitable important football

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,000
organization in America. Football's the

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,600
most profitable uh sport in the country.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Advertising is incredibly valuable

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,840
during football games. increasingly so

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,239
because now we all watch it's the one

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,000
place in the world you don't stream. So

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,399
we stream everything we watch now. So we

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
don't have ads. You can't stream sports.

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,840
So sports advertising has gone through

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
the roof because advertising in other

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
contexts is less valuable. Used to be

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
you could advertise everywhere. Now you

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,079
can't. It's really just sports at the

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,480
last place people watch ads. This is

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,399
incredibly valuable. Now the NFL is 32

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
teams essentially 32 businesses

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,640
competing in a literal sense with each

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,079
other.

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,840
So this and there's a huge incentive to

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
collude.

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's take the New York Giants and the

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,360
New York Jets and you know the New

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Jersey Giant New York Jets, but it's the

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,439
same same market.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,439
Let's say that they both Let's say the

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
TV station says the major TV station

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,799
says, "Look, we're going to broadcast

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
whichever team gives us the better

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
deal." Well, the Giants and Jets will

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
have to compete with each other. Give

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,720
the TV station a better deal. But let's

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,439
say they look we'll agree not to do

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,520
that. We'll just tell the TV station

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
this is our price. It's two mill you

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,479
know basically instead of a billion

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,320
dollars it'll be $2 billion. We each

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,920
have $2 billion. Either take it or leave

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
it and TV station end up broadcasting

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
both or maybe one TV station takes one

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,960
another TV station takes another.

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,280
And more generally what the NFL does is

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,600
they only sell the TV rights for the

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,560
league. They don't sell TV rights for

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,920
individual teams. So, individual teams

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
do not sell their TV rights, which

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,240
should lead to competition. The league

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,759
just sells the TV rights, which causes a

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,119
cartel.

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,240
Essentially, they're saying, "If you

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,000
want to broadcast football, you got to

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,119
come to us, and we're only going to

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
we're going to charge a super high

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,200
price." As a result, quite frankly,

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
watching football is a bit of a pain in

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,400
the ass at this point. So, you've got

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,280
network TV, which if the local team is

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
on, you can only watch the local team.

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,319
Otherwise, there may be one other game

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
on.

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,560
You've got Sunday Night Football, which

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,080
is on network TV. You've got Thursday

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,599
Night Football, which I think is on

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,319
Amazon or ESPN. Amazon. Thursday night.

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,640
Who's got Thursday Night Football?

73
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,480
>> A Amazon. You've got Sunday morning

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
football from London, which is ESPN

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,599
Plus.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,920
Then you can do what I did and pony up

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,280
$350 to buy Sunday Ticket. If you like

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
an out of town team and want to watch

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
your team, which let you watch any game

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,239
you want on Sunday, except the Sunday

81
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
morning games where you still have to

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,200
buy ESPN Plus. as I learned much to my

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,120
chagrin. So, it's incredibly expensive

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
to watch football. If you want to see

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
all the football games, it costs you a

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
pretty penny. Why? Because the league

87
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,480
has colluded and set up a structure

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
where basically firms can't undercut

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
each other. Otherwise, firms would say,

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
"Look, a lot of people want my team. I'm

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,720
going to go strike a separate deal."

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,920
Indeed, in 1957,

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,000
the Supreme Court 1957, even before I

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,879
was born, that's how long ago it was,

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,959
the Supreme Court ruled that this was

96
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,519
anti-competitive and they couldn't do

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,239
it.

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,680
They did. Yet, it's still done. And the

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,319
NFL will make $40 billion this year off

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,239
their collusive cartel.

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,120
Why?

102
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,480
Because Congress stepped in. and said,

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,959
'Well, we're going to grant them an

104
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
antitrust exemption. We're going to say

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
football is such of a national important

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
priority that we're going to actually

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,519
exempt football from our nation's

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
antitrust laws. So, I said last time in

109
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,959
my previous lecture, I'd proved to you

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
that Congress cares more about football

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
than economics.

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,319
Okay? They cared more about the football

113
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,480
league than actually making football

114
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
affordable for us to watch. So by

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
granting them an antitrust exemption,

116
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,920
they allowed them to collude and have

117
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,760
this one league that makes it incredibly

118
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
expensive to watch football.
