1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,240
But the first thing I want to do is

2
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,279
explain

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,279
the kaly tree theorem.

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,279
And

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,599
so the question is how many labelings

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,679
labelings

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,760
of

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,760
um a tree

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,559
on n vertices.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,399
And what I want to do is I want to um

11
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,559
give you the first few elements in this

12
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,160
few first few numbers in this sequence

13
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,960
and

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,480
let you guess the answer. So the first

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,199
one

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,400
is a tree on two vertices.

17
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,400
And if you want to label it with

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
um

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,880
with one and two, there's only really

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:21,680
one way of doing it, which is that. And

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:25,439
now so that's um n = 2 n = 3

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:30,080
1 2 3

23
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,360
which is clearly the same as 1 3 2

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,360
because these trees

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,360
actually

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,880
23

27
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,880
and 312.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,079
So there's one way of doing this, three

29
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,079
ways of doing this. N= 4.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,640
Okay, this time I'm not going to list

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,880
them all out because they're too many to

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,880
count, but I'm going to list them

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,880
in,

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,760
you know, the form of the tree. So how

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,239
many ways are they doing it? are they're

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,879
labeling a tree which is a path. Can

37
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,879
anyone tell me?

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
Yeah.

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,640
>> Maybe like four choose two to choose the

40
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:35,760
two middle ones and then two.

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,680
>> Yeah. 4 choose 2 * 2 which is 12

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,760
because you get to choose which two are

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,239
the middle ones.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,840
And

45
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,840
um then there are two ways of completing

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,480
that.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,480
And how about

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,959
a tree that looks like this? Um wait, I

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:03,239
drew one too many leaves on that.

50
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,239
How many ways of there of doing this?

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,239
Four. because the only thing that

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,360
matters is the middle one. So four and

53
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,599
this becomes 16.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,480
And let's do n= 5.

55
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,560
And there's one of these. Um oops, I

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,200
drew I drew an extra leaf on that one,

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,200
too. Sorry. There are five of these.

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
And

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,720
there are five factorial over two ways

60
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,799
because there are five factorial ways of

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,760
labeling the vertices from left to

62
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,000
right. And

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,599
but

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,159
this tree is symmetric in left and

65
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,599
right. So you're double counting if you

66
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,239
do that which is 60.

67
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,239
And then there are

68
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:11,120
again five factorial over two because

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,959
um

70
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,479
you can

71
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,880
label these 1 3 2 4 5 but you can swap

72
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,600
five and four and get the same tree. So

73
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,639
there's a extra factor of two and this

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,160
is 16.

75
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,600
and you add these up, you get 125.

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,600
So, does anybody see a pattern?

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,280
>> Yeah.

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,240
>> Like multiply by three, then by four,

79
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,919
then by like I guess like like within

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,639
the sequence.

81
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,000
>> Yeah. Well, I mean, yes, that's

82
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,759
essentially the right idea. This is 3 to

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,280
the 1. This is 2 to the 0. This is 4^

84
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,440
squared.

85
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:07,680
And this one is 5 cubed.

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:12,600
So the kay tree theorem says there are n

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,600
to the n minus2 ways of doing this.

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,880
So that's the statement of the kay tree

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
theorem.

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,080
And

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,440
there are lots and lots of proofs. So

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,360
one way you might think of proving it is

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,160
to find a bjection between labelled

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,160
trees and sequences of the numbers 1

95
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,919
through n of length n minus2.

96
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,560
And you can do it that way. But this

97
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,800
bjection is really incredibly

98
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,919
complicated and completely

99
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,639
non-intuitive. So that's not really the

100
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,000
right way to do it. So what I'm going to

101
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,120
do is try to explain

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,160
a way of doing this by counting these

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,680
certain object twice or certain object

104
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,479
in two different ways. And how do we do

105
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,319
this?

106
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:20,800
So

107
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:22,479
let t subn be number of labeled

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,960
trees

109
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,960
on n vertices.

110
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,560
And the first thing we're going to do is

111
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:39,600
change the thing to

112
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,519
number of lab of labeled rooted trees on

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,539
nver vertices.

114
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,539
[applause]

115
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Okay.

116
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,840
So, what do you do to get a rooted tree

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,400
is a

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,400
tree

119
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
with

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,599
uh specified vertex called the room.

121
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,680
Okay. So

122
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,199
um

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
if t subn is the number of labeled trees

124
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,880
on nver vertices,

125
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,599
what is the number of labeled rooted

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,599
trees on n vertices?

127
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:05,039
Okay. Well, what you do is you start

128
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:08,800
with a tree. Let's do this tree. 1 3 2.

129
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,800
And now you pick a vertex to call the

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,560
root. So in this case you can

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,440
you can

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,560
do this is the root and three

133
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,080
one two this is the root or you could do

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,080
two

135
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,759
3 one this is the root.

136
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,000
So

137
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,360
to go from a label tree to a root tree

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,959
labeled rud tree we just pick one vertex

139
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,959
and so there are n * p subn of these

140
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,640
and now

141
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,360
what we're going to Count.

142
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,440
What we count

143
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,440
in two ways

144
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,880
is labeled

145
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,880
rooted trees

146
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,480
with ordered edges.

147
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:34,440
So, let's pick the um middle one there.

148
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,440
One, three, two.

149
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,279
So, we need to order the edges. And we

150
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,320
can either order this one and then this

151
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,440
one and then this one and then this one.

152
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,080
So, I'm going to use letters to order

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
the edges because otherwise we have too

154
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:56,000
many numbers floating around and it gets

155
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:59,560
confusing. So, 3 2 1

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,560
A B.

157
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
So

158
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,519
how many labeled trees

159
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,000
in terms of t subn the number of labeled

160
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,600
trees? How many labeled rooted trees

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,600
with ordered edges are there going to

162
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
be?

163
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
So there are n minus one edges. How many

164
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,959
ways are there of ordering n minus one

165
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
edges?

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:38,160
n minus one factorial. Very good. So

167
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:40,079
this is t subn * n * n minus one

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,560
factorial.

169
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,640
Okay.

170
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,600
So

171
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:54,240
if we can count this in a way that tells

172
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,440
us the answer is n to the nus2

173
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,120
* n * n -1 factorial.

174
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,120
Then we have proven the theorem.

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Okay.

176
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,760
So

177
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,760
the second way of counting

178
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,720
there

179
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,720
are

180
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,920
n

181
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:34,279
to the n minus

182
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,279
2 n factorial

183
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,920
labeled rooted trees with ordered

184
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,880
Good.

185
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,920
So how do we prove this lema?

186
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,320
What we will do

187
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,320
proof method

188
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,800
um

189
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,120
construct

190
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,120
a labeled

191
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,839
rooted

192
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,399
tree.

193
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,399
I'm going to say via labeled rooted

194
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,399
forests

195
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,079
by adding one edge at a time.

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,680
So back here we have

197
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,839
this n minus one factorial which is the

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,079
order of the edges. And this order of

199
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,120
the edges is just going to be the order

200
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:13,279
that we add the edges

201
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,839
to get to

202
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,560
via labeled rooted forest to get to the

203
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,560
label rooted tree.

204
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Okay.

205
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,440
And I'm going to do it by example, but

206
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,200
well basically because it's much easier

207
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,240
to see by example than if I try to

208
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,240
describe the process in words. So we

209
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,240
start

210
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,000
with a forest. I never told you what a

211
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,680
forest is. A forest is a collection of

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,680
trees

213
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,680
which

214
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,279
I'm going to say that this makes perfect

215
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:02,760
sense. So, start with a forest with

216
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,760
n trees

217
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,320
with one vortex each.

218
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,440
One, two, three, four, five, six.

219
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,680
Choose

220
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,680
one of these trees.

221
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,199
And what we're going to do is we're

222
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,920
going to add it to a vertex

223
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,720
and add

224
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,959
it

225
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,959
on top of a vertex

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,959
in another tree.

227
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,440
And let's see.

228
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
So,

229
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,519
so let's take one of these trees

230
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,399
and stick it on top of a vertex in

231
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,399
another

232
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,399
So this gives us

233
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:16,560
one two

234
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:21,920
um four five

235
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,759
three six and we want to label this with

236
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,560
the letter A because it was the first

237
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,560
thing we did. Now let's take a different

238
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,519
um different tree and stick it on top of

239
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,800
another

240
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,800
you know vertex in a tree and we get

241
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,199
one

242
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:54,320
four five six two

243
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:59,360
and here this was three and this was a

244
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,759
first step. This was our second step.

245
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,120
Okay. And we keep on doing this. And

246
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,120
maybe the next step is we pick

247
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,880
this tree

248
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:17,520
and stick it on top of this vertex.

249
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:24,240
And we have 1 4

250
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:26,319
5 6 2 3 [sighs]

251
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,480
and

252
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,919
B

253
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,039
A and C.

254
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,240
And we keep on doing this until we get

255
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,520
until we've used up all the trees except

256
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,720
one. And we have a labeled rooted tree

257
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,720
with an ordering on the edges.

258
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
So,

259
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,919
how many ways are there of doing this?

260
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,360
Oh gosh. This is

261
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,360
this is one of these um hard to erase

262
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,360
chalks.

263
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,480
Okay.

264
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,840
Well,

265
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,440
how many

266
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,440
configurations are there to start with

267
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,880
anybody.

268
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,799
How many labeled

269
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,720
How many labeled forests with n trees

270
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,720
with one vertex each are there?

271
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,640
I can see nobody's answering it because

272
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:26,480
this question is too easy.

273
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,120
There's only one of them. There are n

274
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,200
vertices and they have the labels one

275
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,799
through n. And since order doesn't

276
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,200
matter, there's one of them.

277
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,200
So one

278
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,960
after

279
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,960
K steps

280
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
have

281
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,520
well each step

282
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:03,520
we have

283
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:07,200
n each step we reduce one tree. So we

284
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,200
have n minus k

285
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
trees.

286
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,520
Take one node

287
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,760
um

288
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,559
add

289
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,559
a different tree.

290
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,120
We take one node, we add a different

291
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,120
tree on that node

292
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,919
to that node.

293
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,440
So for example

294
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,440
here

295
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,440
um

296
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:01,360
here we chose node number five and we

297
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,960
added the fourth tree to that node. So

298
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,960
how many ways are there of doing this

299
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
step?

300
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,080
How many ways are there of choosing a

301
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,080
node? Anybody?

302
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Yes.

303
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,480
How many nodes are there?

304
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,480
N. And we can choose any one of them. So

305
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,960
there are n ways of choosing the node.

306
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,520
And now we have n minus k trees. And we

307
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,799
want to choose a different tree to add

308
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:54,440
on top of the node. So there are n minus

309
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,440
k minus one trees we can add.

310
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,880
So there's n * n - k -1

311
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,400
ways

312
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,400
to do this.

313
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:14,760
[clears throat]

314
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,760
So number of

315
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,360
okay what was it labeled rooted trees

316
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,919
labeled

317
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,159
rooted

318
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,960
trees

319
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,960
with edge ordering

320
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,400
is the product.

321
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,120
Well,

322
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,440
so after k steps, so after we want to

323
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,240
start with how many ways there are after

324
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,080
zero steps. So zero

325
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,159
to

326
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,960
well there are n minus one steps

327
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,960
altogether. So n minus 2 I believe

328
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,679
um

329
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,679
n

330
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,039
- k - one.

331
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,799
Um

332
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:28,640
[clears throat] so

333
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:35,919
this is equal to<unk>

334
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:43,320
from 0 k = 0 to n - 2 n *<unk> from k =

335
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:43,320
0 to n minus 2 of n - k -1

336
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,640
which is equal to well there are n

337
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,640
um

338
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,440
there are n minus one steps and each of

339
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,480
these you have a factor of n. So this is

340
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:08,120
just n * n minus one and this is should

341
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,120
be n minus

342
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,200
1

343
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
factorial

344
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:24,360
which

345
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,360
if I haven't erased it

346
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,760
yeah we wanted to so show that there are

347
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,559
n to the n minus 2 n factorial, but

348
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,880
that's the same as n^ the nus1 * n minus

349
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:39,200
one factorial. So this is the number of

350
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,120
labelled rooted trees with an edge

351
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,919
ordering.

352
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,320
So this implies that

353
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,480
t subn

354
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,120
* n

355
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,120
times

356
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
um

357
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,240
n minus one factorial.

358
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,799
So this is the number of labeled rooted

359
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,000
trees on node

360
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:13,520
and this is the number of edge orderings

361
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:19,600
is equal to n -1 * n -1 factorial which

362
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:24,320
shows you that p subn = n - 2

363
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,320
to the n to the n minus 2

364
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,760
which is what we wanted to prove.

365
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,320
Okay. Yes.

366
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,679
>> And then isn't the second one just

367
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,440
picking like which like a tree that's

368
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,480
not as trees you already picked?

369
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,000
>> That's right. Well, is tricking a tree?

370
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,520
No, because you can pick a tree that

371
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
you've already picked. You just cannot

372
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,520
pick a tree. You cannot pick the tree

373
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,440
that that node is in.

374
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,840
>> Yeah.

375
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,159
So, we pick a node here and then we pick

376
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,720
a different tree to put on top of it.

377
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,559
And that's five, six, two.

378
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,880
>> Doesn't it [snorts] matter like how you

379
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,240
connect them like with the other tree

380
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,039
because you're just picking like another

381
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,960
tree to

382
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,480
>> Oh, we're always going to put the root

383
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,279
of this tree

384
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,279
>> on top of this note.

385
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,279
And

386
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,159
you can see that the process can be

387
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,480
undone because if we have A B C, the way

388
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:55,520
we undo this step is we find the last

389
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:58,799
edge and we cut it and we have a tree on

390
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,520
top of that edge and we have the tree

391
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:05,039
that's left when you remove this edge.

392
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,559
So that undoes the step. So the whole

393
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:12,640
process is I'm going to say that there

394
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:15,039
is uh you know this function that takes

395
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,039
you from

396
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,039
trees

397
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:26,240
trees on k n minus k nodes to trees

398
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:28,559
[clears throat] or to forests of n minus

399
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,480
k trees to forests of n minus k minus

400
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,279
one trees is reversible. So it's a

401
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,240
bjection.

402
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,240
But yeah, that was a good question.

403
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,600
Okay. So,

404
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:01,279
and last year we actually used

405
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,919
this theorem for one of our term paper

406
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,520
projects.

407
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,279
This year we're not. But um

408
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I I wanted to tell you this at the

409
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,399
beginning of the um class, but I forgot.

410
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,720
So what we're going to do is tonight,

411
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,600
assuming all goes well, I will put up

412
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,279
the term paper projects and their

413
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,360
assignments to students. And tomorrow in

414
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,120
recitation

415
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,919
um the

416
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,320
you know the recitation leaders will

417
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,000
discuss them a little bit. Although most

418
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,279
of the recitation tomorrow is going to

419
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,279
be devoted to writing.

420
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,279
Okay.

421
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,399
So the term paper projects are hopefully

422
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,399
coming out tonight.

423
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,880
Okay.

424
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:01,480
So now we are going to switch topics and

425
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,480
go to generating functions.

426
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Okay.

427
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,120
And generating functions

428
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,919
are a very useful concept in mathematics

429
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,159
and you can use them to count things.

430
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,159
I mean there are proofs of the kaly tree

431
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,720
theorem that use generating functions

432
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,120
and there are

433
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,640
proofs of probably nearly everything

434
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,880
we've discussed in terms of counting

435
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,679
that use generating functions. Although

436
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,440
often the generating functions proofs

437
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,760
are more difficult than the

438
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,760
non-generating functions proofs. On the

439
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,520
other hand, there are cases where

440
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,840
generating functions are really the only

441
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,279
way to do it. And the other advantage of

442
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,200
generating functions is that they're

443
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:11,039
mechanical. So given uh say cominatorial

444
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,480
identity and you look at it and you say

445
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,440
what can I what things can I count in

446
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,600
two different ways to prove it or

447
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,360
something else

448
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,200
well it's um

449
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,840
no you have to use some creativity to

450
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:33,679
find this but if you have a generating

451
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,320
fun uh combinatorial identity with

452
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,480
general generating functions. Often it's

453
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,200
fairly straightforward to prove it using

454
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:45,679
generating functions although it

455
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,399
involves actual algebra. So it's

456
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,159
maybe more difficult.

457
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,640
So

458
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,640
why am I

459
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:10,559
let a1 well a z a1 a2 etc be a sequence

460
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,559
of numbers

461
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,960
The generating function

462
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,200
associated with a C sequence.

463
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,240
is

464
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:57,120
f ofx

465
00:31:51,120 --> 00:32:00,640
is equal to sum a sub i x to the i

466
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,640
= 0 to infinity.

467
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,640
And

468
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,200
so this is a

469
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,240
an algebraic function and that means you

470
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,760
can use all the tools of algebraic

471
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,799
functions to manipulate it and this we

472
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,840
will find is going to be very useful.

473
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,440
Now um

474
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,080
you can ask what does X mean here? And X

475
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:44,159
doesn't really mean anything. It's just

476
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:48,880
a tool for keeping track of what the

477
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,679
what the I is on AI X to the I. So it's

478
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,080
key way of keeping

479
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,799
um

480
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,960
the E

481
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,720
AI from different distinct from the J

482
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,799
AI.

483
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,799
So it usually doesn't really mean

484
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,799
anything.

485
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,080
So the example

486
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
um

487
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,799
well one example is we'll take the

488
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,679
sequence

489
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,679
of binomial coefficients.

490
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,159
So what is this f subn?

491
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,159
All right.

492
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:53,600
A subn is equal to k choose n.

493
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:58,039
[snorts]

494
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,039
So the generating function for this

495
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,519
f ofx is equal to sum

496
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,560
and here n is what we're summing over n=

497
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,119
0 through infinity

498
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,280
and

499
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,879
you know this is zero if n is bigger

500
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:21,119
than k. So that's sum n= 0 through k

501
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,240
a

502
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,560
um k

503
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:31,359
choose n.

504
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:34,879
Let me write a n x to the n k

505
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:40,280
x to the n.

506
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,280
And you should know what this is.

507
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:49,240
This is a binomial theorem and it's just

508
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,240
like 1 + x to the k.

509
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,560
And one way of thinking about this is

510
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,880
f ofx

511
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,280
equals

512
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,240
1 + x

513
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,880
1 + x

514
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,880
1 + x.

515
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,720
Okay. So for the kth term

516
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,960
no for m term I'm sorry

517
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,400
choose

518
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,079
n x's

519
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,480
k minus n ones.

520
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,960
Good. So we need to choose whether we'll

521
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,640
use the x from this one, the x from this

522
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,640
one,

523
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,880
the x from this one, etc. So we're

524
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:54,240
choosing k x's. We're choosing n x's out

525
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,880
of k things,

526
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,560
which is just n choose k or k choose n,

527
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm sorry. And so that's why a subn is

528
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,560
k.

529
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Okay.

530
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,320
So, example two.

531
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,599
Um,

532
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,440
the

533
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,079
A subn is the probability

534
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,359
of

535
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,440
of N heads.

536
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,440
When you flip a coin,

537
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,760
a biased coin,

538
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,240
K times,

539
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:19,240
and we'll let P equal probability of

540
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,240
heads

541
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,640
and Q

542
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,640
= 1 - p.

543
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:50,240
So a of x is equal to summation a subn x

544
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:54,720
to the n is equal to

545
00:37:50,240 --> 00:38:00,640
k choose n p to the

546
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:02,320
k q to the n minus k * x to the k x to

547
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,160
the n

548
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:10,920
x.

549
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,920
Ah, I keep mixing up my K's and my Ns.

550
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,240
Let me apologize for that. There we go.

551
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,000
And this is equal to I forgot the sum

552
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,599
here.

553
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,599
This is equal to

554
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,160
um

555
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,920
q + px

556
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:52,200
to the n

557
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,200
again by the binomial theorem.

558
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,079
So

559
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,079
hopefully I will have time to do a real

560
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,400
example that shows you why generating

561
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,000
functions are useful

562
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,320
at before the end of class. But if not,

563
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,880
we'll get to it tomorrow or not

564
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,880
tomorrow, Thursday.

565
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Okay.

566
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:21,359
[clears throat] But I want to say a few

567
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,359
more general things about um generating

568
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,359
functions.

569
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,320
Let

570
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:34,040
A

571
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,040
B be disjoint classes of objects

572
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,480
and C

573
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:56,920
equals A union B where

574
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,920
U is disjoint union.

575
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,119
So that just says that A intersection B

576
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,480
is the empty set.

577
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,359
So I'm going to say the generating

578
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,359
function for C of X.

579
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,280
So what we're going to do is we're going

580
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,160
to express the generating function for C

581
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,160
of X in terms of A of X and B of X is

582
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,880
equal to

583
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,880
A of well

584
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:36,640
it's going to be some C subn X to the N.

585
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:41,520
Well, c subn is just a subn + b subn

586
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:45,040
is equal to sum a sub n + b subn

587
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,640
x to the n

588
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,200
which you can see is the generating

589
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,200
function of a of x plus b of x.

590
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,160
Okay. So the next one we want to talk

591
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,520
about multiplication of generating

592
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,800
functions. This is actually first pretty

593
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,040
straightforward and second

594
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,720
is not really that useful in

595
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,960
manipulating generating functions.

596
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,040
Multip multiplying generating functions

597
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,040
is incredibly useful and we'll do an

598
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,040
example.

599
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,359
So let's do the example first and then

600
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,359
we will do

601
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,359
the

602
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,920
the formal um

603
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,079
the formal um explanation

604
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:02,680
So, let's say we have a six-sided dice

605
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,680
and an eight-sided dice.

606
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,040
Eightsided dice.

607
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,319
And we want to know what

608
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,560
is the

609
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:28,599
probability

610
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,599
of rolling.

611
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,520
Okay,

612
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,280
let's call it

613
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,200
n.

614
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,200
when we add up the numbers from the two

615
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,200
die

616
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,200
and I should

617
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,720
you know specify that the six-sided dice

618
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,800
is numbered 1 through six and the

619
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,800
eight-sided die is numbered 1 through

620
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,800
eight.

621
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:58,819
[clears throat]

622
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,480
So

623
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:15,119
let

624
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:19,160
c subn is equal to number of ways

625
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,160
of rolling n.

626
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Claim

627
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,960
C subn is equal to or rather C subn

628
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:42,880
C of X is equal to sum

629
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:51,599
C sub N X to the N is equal to

630
00:43:42,880 --> 00:44:00,520
X + X2 + X cub + X 6

631
00:43:51,599 --> 00:44:00,520
+ X2 + Xub 2 + dot dot dot + x to 8

632
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,359
equ=

633
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:12,359
x + 2 x^2 + 3 x cub + dot dot dot

634
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:23,680
+ 5 x 5th + 6 x to 6 + 7 x to the plus

635
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:29,960
sorry 6 x to 7th

636
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,960
plus 6 x to the 8th plus

637
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:41,560
6 x to the 9th

638
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,560
+ 5 x to the 10th plus dot dot dot

639
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,560
plus x to the 14th.

640
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,839
So, how do we get that?

641
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,520
So you can see from this that there are

642
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:33,359
five ways of rolling a 10. You can roll

643
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,880
a six and a

644
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,160
four

645
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:42,480
and you can roll a

646
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,880
five and a five. A four and a six. a

647
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,800
three and a seven and a two and an

648
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,640
eight.

649
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:54,119
And

650
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,119
you know and this works because

651
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,920
C subn is equal to summation.

652
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:05,480
[clears throat]

653
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,480
J = 0

654
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,359
J = 1 through N.

655
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,359
Um,

656
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,240
okay.

657
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,280
A subj

658
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,280
B sub N minus J.

659
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,520
So if you want to get an N, the first

660
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,319
place has to be J and the second one has

661
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,800
to be N minus J.

662
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,760
And [clears throat]

663
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,040
AJ equals

664
00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:02,800
1 if one is less than J is less than

665
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:06,240
six, zero otherwise, and B subj = 1 if

666
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,640
one is less than J is less than 8, and

667
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,640
zero otherwise.

668
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,079
Is this clear? I mean, to get an N, you

669
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,400
have to roll a J on the first dice and

670
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,800
an N minus J on the second dice. And you

671
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,480
can only roll a J on the first dice if J

672
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:34,000
is between one and six. And you can only

673
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:38,119
roll an N minus J on the second die if J

674
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,119
is between one and eight.

675
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,359
So

676
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:51,000
if

677
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,000
a of x is equal to summation

678
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:04,160
i = 1 through 6 x to the i

679
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:07,440
and b of x is equal to summation i = 1

680
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,440
through 8

681
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:13,560
x to the i. That's not a very good

682
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,560
eight.

683
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,680
Then

684
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:26,319
c of x = [applause] a of x

685
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,640
b of x

686
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:32,440
because this is the formula for

687
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,440
multiplying polinomials.

688
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,880
So we have the generating function for

689
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:51,040
the first die and the generating

690
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,559
function for the second die. And we get

691
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:57,400
the generating function for the sum of

692
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,400
the two dies by just multiplying them.

693
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:28,480
And let's make this rigorous. Let A

694
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,319
Let a

695
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,440
B

696
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,440
be two classes of objects.

697
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:42,959
[sighs]

698
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:58,680
A of X and B of X

699
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,680
be their generating functions.

700
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,960
Then

701
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,559
oh well

702
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,079
the cartisian product

703
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,240
product

704
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,240
A cross B

705
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,000
is

706
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:42,200
A B

707
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,200
A N A B and B.

708
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,280
And we want to claim

709
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:53,520
that size

710
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:55,760
of a b equals size

711
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:01,720
of a

712
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,720
s plus size of b.

713
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,119
Then

714
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,119
the

715
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,280
cartisian product

716
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,400
A cross B

717
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,079
has

718
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,079
generating function.

719
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:50,760
A of x B of X equals C of X.

720
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
poof.

721
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:40,480
Okay.

722
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:44,559
C subn equals summation

723
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,400
K = Z through

724
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,960
N

725
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:54,000
A subk

726
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:58,319
B sub N minus K. So we want to look at

727
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,880
the things of size n in the cartisian

728
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,480
product. Well, they're the things of

729
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,720
size

730
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,520
k

731
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,040
in the first

732
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,599
um

733
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,599
generating function and the thing times

734
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,520
the things of size n minus k in the

735
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,119
second generating function. And when one

736
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,040
is sum this over all k.

737
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:25,119
And now

738
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:29,280
we just need to check that summation c

739
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:36,720
subn x to the n is equal to

740
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:43,359
summation k = z to n a sub k b n minus k

741
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:46,520
x to the n is equal to some k = z

742
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,520
or rather

743
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:58,079
and = 0 to infinity. I forgot the second

744
00:53:51,920 --> 00:54:01,920
sum here. n = 0 to infinity. k= 0 to n

745
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:07,280
which is just sum k= 0 to infinity a

746
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:14,680
subk x to the k summation

747
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:14,680
j = 0 to infinity b subj x to the j

748
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,800
because [clears throat] you know when

749
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,000
you multiply these

750
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:29,920
you group the things that have the same

751
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:34,640
k + j= n and that gives you this term

752
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,520
sum k= 0 to n a sub k b subn minus k.

753
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,967
Yeah.

754
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,960
>> What does size mean? Size is

00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:43,920
[clears throat]

756
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,720
size is just an arbitrary

function on these objects that

correspond to the

the the

00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:02,280
n here in summation a subk x to the k.

761
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,280
So

762
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,319
when you have generating functions,

763
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:12,319
you're grouping objects into

764
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:14,559
things that go with x to the k and um

765
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:17,440
those

766
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,920
are what we're calling size.

767
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,280
>> So is it the power of x?

768
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,960
>> It's the power of x that is associated

769
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,599
with the object. And I think we should

770
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:33,333
look at a actual example.

771
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,353
So this is a simple example.

772
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,353
[clears throat]

773
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,119
example.

774
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,400
Okay. Suppose

775
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,079
you have

776
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,040
one penny.

777
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:26,640
No, six pennies.

778
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:29,960
Um, one nickel,

779
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,960
two dimes.

780
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,720
How many different ways

781
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,880
can you

782
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,880
make

783
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,920
an

784
00:56:57,174 --> 00:57:01,880

786
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,079
the generating function

787
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:18,720
let's call it

788
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:21,200
um c of x is equal to sum cn x to the n.

789
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:24,400
So we'll let C subn be the number of

790
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:28,880
different ways

791
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:32,799

six pennies, a nickel and two dimes.

794
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:50,880
C of X is equal to 1 + X + X^2 + X cub +

00:57:44,720 --> 00:58:00,079
X4 + X 5th + X 6

796
00:57:50,880 --> 00:58:00,079
1 + X 5th and 1 + X 10th + X to the 20th

797
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,079
Okay.

798
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,040
So, when you multiply these things

799
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:20,880
together, let's look at the x to the 20.

800
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,720
Let's look at the x to the

801
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,000
I'm thinking

802
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,000
x to the 21st term.

803
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:41,480
So it can be get got from x to the 6th *

804
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,480
x 5th * x 10th

805
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:53,559
and we can also get it from x times x to

806
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,559
the 20th

807
00:58:54,799 --> 00:59:00,480
and those are the only two ways you can

808
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:04,000
get it. So there are two ways to make

809
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,000
chain two two

810
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,559

[clears throat]

814
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:23,799
So here the size is just the

00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,799
number of cents.

816
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,359
Okay, let's do something a little bit

817
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,359
more complicated.

818
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,000
How

819
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,280
many

820
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,599
ways are there

821
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,599
to pay

822
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:15,799
let's say n cents in

823
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,799
an arbitrary number of pennies,

824
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,160
nickels,

825
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,359
dimes.

826
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:25,521
[clears throat and cough]

827
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:36,079
Well, I want to claim that it's 1 + x +

828
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:41,200
x^2 + x cub + dot dot dot * 1 + x 5th +

830
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:53,599
plus dot dot dot * 1 + x 10th + x 20th +

831
01:00:48,079 --> 01:01:00,319
x to the 30th plus dot dot dot

832
01:00:53,599 --> 01:01:05,559
which is equal to 1 1 - x 1 / 1 - x 5th

833
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:05,559
* 1 / 1 - x 10th.

834
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,992
So cn x to the n is equal to that.

835
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,992
[clears throat]

836
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:35,200
Okay. So now I want to

837
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:37,200
give an example for how you would

838
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,520
actually use a generating function. I

839
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,960
mean, we have not gotten to the end of

840
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,559
our, you know, overall

841
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,160
description of generating functions, but

842
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,480
I want to give you an example first of

843
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:52,760
how you would actually

844
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,760
calculate something with them.

845
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,200
And

846
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:04,200
I want to claim this is really pretty

847
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,200
neat.

848
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:19,760
What

849
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:26,920
is sum

850
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:26,920
k= 0 through n k n choose k.

851
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,200
Okay. So the first thing is you can do

852
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,040
it by counting something two different

853
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,200
ways and I want to do it with generating

854
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,520
functions first and if I have any time

855
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,240
at the end of the class I'll check it by

856
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,640
counting by using the technique of

857
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:52,880
counting in two different ways but I'm

858
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:56,200
not sure I will. So what is it? K = 0

859
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,200
through N

860
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:03,839
choose K * X to the K is equal to

861
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,839
Does anybody want to tell me what this

862
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,839
is?

863
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,599
>> Yeah.

864
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,680
>> Um

865
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,359
no because we want this as a function of

866
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,480
something with x's in it.

867
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:27,520
>> 1 plus x.

868
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:31,520
>> Yeah. 1 plus x to the n. That's right. 1

869
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:36,079
+ x to the n. Excellent.

870
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:40,720
Okay. Now, and this is

871
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:45,359
we should call this f ofx.

872
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:48,000
Now, how can we get this out of that?

873
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:51,000
Well, let's differentiate.

874
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
dx

875
01:03:51,200 --> 01:04:00,640
f ofx

876
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:02,799
is equal to sum k = z through n k

877
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:08,039
n choose k

878
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:08,039
x to the k minus one.

879
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:15,599
Right?

880
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:19,359
Okay. And now let's differentiate this.

881
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:22,680
Well, that's just n * 1 + x to the n

882
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,680
minus one.

883
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,039
And now let's substitute

884
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:38,960
x = 1.

885
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:43,280
Well, in this we get sum k = 0 through n

886
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:46,799
k k n choose k

887
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:54,039
and in this we get

888
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:54,039
n * 2 to the n minus one.

889
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,319
Okay,

890
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,799
we have our answer.

891
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,000
And [clears throat]

892
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,039
I I want to say

893
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:29,240
that

894
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:29,240
we kind of skipped a step here.

895
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:37,319
Um

896
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,319
generating function

897
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:48,520
for

898
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,520
K N choose K

899
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:59,559
um is

900
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:59,559
some K N choose K X to the K

901
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,200
K = 0 through N.

902
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,435
And [clears throat]

903
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:14,319
what we calculated here

904
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:18,240
was just k n choose k x to the k minus

905
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:25,240
one. So this is actually

906
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:25,240
n x 1 - x to the n minus one.

907
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,480
But since x if we're substituting x= 1,

908
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,200
it doesn't matter if we have

909
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:42,119
x to the k or x to the k minus one here

910
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,119
or if we have this extra

911
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,599
sorry plus or if we have this extra x

912
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:53,119
here

913
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:57,039
it will if x is one they're the same.

914
01:06:53,119 --> 01:07:00,039
So to get so to multiply

915
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,039
the

916
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:07,119
nth term

917
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:09,920
in or to multiply the k the kth term in

918
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:14,480
a generating function by k, we just

919
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:17,200
differentiate and multiply by x.

920
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,000
And this is a very useful trick playing

921
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,640
with generating functions.

922
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,720
So, how would you do this with counting

923
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,720
two different ways?

924
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,720

>> Yeah,

01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,480
>> it's [snorts]

932
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:52,960
K.

933
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:55,839
What you ask like what's like

934
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,599
um we want to answer what question are

935
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:01,359

937
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:06,640
what is summation k and

938
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,480
>> I mean like you just asked counting two

939
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,400
ways like which

940
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,480
>> oh we want to answer this question by

941
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,680
counting in two different ways. Oh okay.

942
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,759
So it's like you pick you have a set of

943
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,679
A elements and you pick K elements out

944
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,359
of it and then from the K elements you

945
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,440
pick one special element.

946
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:26,920
>> Yeah. Exactly.

947
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,920
So we have

948
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:32,120
set of n elements

949
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,920
choose

950
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,920
K elements.

951
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:48,359
choose

952
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:48,359
one of the K elements.

953
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:59,600
So we have a special element

954
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:05,719
and then we have a subset of K and a

955
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:05,719
subset of N minus K minus one

956
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:14,600
and sum over K. We just have a special

957
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,600
element

958
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,920
of um

959
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:27,719
k

960
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,719
n choose k.

961
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,359
We have a special element

962
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:48,279
and a subset of the remaining subset

963
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,279
of n minus one other elements

964
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:58,080
and you know you can pick the special

965
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,080
element nways.

966
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,560
other elements

967
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,679
are the subset sorry

968
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,679
the subset of other elements

969
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,120
elements

970
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,600
is 2 the nus1 ways

971
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:43,440
and this gives

972
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:46,159
n * 2 the n minus one

973
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,719
which is what we wanted in the first

974
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,880
place.

975
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:54,280
Okay, so that's two different ways to

976
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,280
solve this problem.

977
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,560
And I want to say that, you know, so far

978
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,120
we're only doing things with generating

979
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,480
functions that we could have done more

980
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:15,120
easily some other way. But there are

981
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,640
things that you can do with generating

982
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,400
functions that are much harder to do

983
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,159
other ways. And we will eventually get

984
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,000
to those

985
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:24,080
when we start talking about Fibonacci

986
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,719
numbers.

987
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,719
And um

988
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,320
I think the next thing I want to do is

989
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,880
too long. It didn't do three minutes. So

990
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,880
I will let you go and see everyone on

991
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,880
Thursday.
