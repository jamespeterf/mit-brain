00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,800
What if a material could mimic the properties 
of living tissue, hold vast amounts of water,  

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,440
and help solve some of the planet's biggest 
challenges? Meet hydrogels, soft, flexible,  

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,280
water-rich materials that are quietly shaping the 
future of medicine, technology, and environmental  

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,560
sustainability. A hydrogel is, you can think of 
it as a molecular net that likes to capture water.  

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,240
And it's an interesting material because it's 
not quite a solid and not quite a liquid,  

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,560
but molecules interface with it as if it's 
a liquid. Hydrogels are networks of polymer  

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,720
chains that can absorb and retain extraordinary 
amounts of water, sometimes up to 99% of their  

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,120
weight. This gives them a unique blend 
of softness and strength, making them  

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,800
behave more like living tissue than traditional 
materials. In healthcare, hydrogels are making  

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,280
the leap from the lab bench to the human body. 
Conventional hydrogels have been widely used  

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,760
in biomedical applications such as scaffolds 
for tissue engineering, organ regeneration,  

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:18,000
and carriers for drug release. Used in wound 
dressings, these materials can speed up healing  

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,760
by maintaining a moist, protective environment. 
Others are being designed to mimic soft tissues,  

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,600
stretching and flexing with the body in ways 
rigid implants never could. So we call this a new  

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:39,120
field that we pioneered hydrogel bio electronics. 
Traditional implantable materials such as metals,  

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:47,680
ceramics always form this kind of scar tissues 
on the interface. Hydrogels, especially adhesive  

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,720
hydrogels, can eliminate the scar tissues. When 
scar tissue forms, it can stiffen and thicken  

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,480
the surrounding area, reducing flexibility and 
disrupting the delicate structures of organs.  

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,840
It can also interfere with the performance 
of implanted devices. Because these soft  

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,080
biocompatible devices mimic the mechanical and 
physiological properties of biological tissues,  

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,960
they can remain in place for months or even years. 
Beyond medicine, hydrogels are helping to address  

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,000
some of the planet's most pressing resource 
challenges. In agriculture, they're being used  

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to improve water retention in dry soils, reducing 
the need for irrigation, and helping crops survive  

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,280
in increasingly unpredictable climates. Farmers 
for more than a thousand years, they could tell  

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,560
just from the coloration of the leaves that there 
were problems during growth. Maybe that there  

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,040
was insufficient watering or maybe the fertilizer 
wasn't applied or there's a bacteria or a fungus.  

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,040
The problem is even today that information gets 
the farmers far too too late. What we're doing is  

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,080
we're making a whole new generation of sensors 
that can be interfaced to the plant and get  

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,720
that information within minutes, sometimes even 
seconds. These sensors made of hydrogels gently  

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,800
penetrate plant tissues without triggering immune 
responses or stress, giving farmers a new window  

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,680
into crop health. And when it comes to clean 
water, hydrogels are also playing an important  

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,120
role. So an example application that we've been 
really excited about is harvesting water from air.  

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,640
Hydrogels have been particularly interesting 
because when you tailor these hydrogels with  

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,960
salts in particular, it can actually get a lot of 
the water vapor even in these very aid climates  

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,440
to be attracted to this hydrogel. These materials 
can absorb water at night, then release it during  

36
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,640
the day, requiring no electricity, just sunlight. 
In this case, you can apply heat and you can use  

37
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,360
a relatively low amount of energy to then release 
the water from this hydrogel matrix and actually  

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,520
get your clean drinking water. The exciting thing 
about hydrogels is the ability to scale these  

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,880
materials. Right now, we're working on these 
prototypes in the lab. So a really important  

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,880
next step is being able to take these hydrogels, 
being able to develop them in a way to now make  

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,440
tons of this type of material and integrate them 
effectively into now more manufacturable systems.  

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,920
Researchers at MIT have played a leading role in 
advancing hydrogel research. Across the institute,  

43
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,200
many groups are now exploring applications 
ranging from self-repairing materials that capture  

44
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,280
atmospheric carbon and methane systems that filter 
micro pollutants from water to hydrogels that  

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:52,160
could inspire the next generation of sustainable 
heating and cooling systems for the home.
