1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,280
okay good

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,280
afternoon can

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:23,359
start all right so we are um talking

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,359
about non equilibrium and U this

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,720
table

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,960
summarizes a bit of what we have

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,000
done with talked

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,719
about forces and

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,440
fluxes

10
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,440
forces can be thought of as the degree

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,039
of dise equilibrium of the various

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:50,239
aspects and the flues are the modes with

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:55,480
which uh

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:01:00,280
molecules uh transfer stuff

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,280
properties the extensive properties

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,320
in fact this a fact that it that

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,759
molecules transport

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:17,799
something gives rise to this language

19
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:20,240
of ftic no like thermoptic

20
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,479
electroforesis foric

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,439
means uh the atmology of the word is

22
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,439
transporting

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,479
something and we want to to today to uh

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,320
introduce a couple of

25
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:44,159
U examples of this uh

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,719
uh transport cross effects that emerge

27
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,640
from this

28
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:54,200
table from the fact that

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:57,039
um not only we find things on on the

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,520
diagonal so we have processes like heat

31
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:03,079
transfer follows for year law or Mass

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,840
transfer that follows fix law that we

33
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,080
will

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,840
derive and

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,920
electric

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,599
Electro Statics

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:21,160
that uh provides HS

38
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:23,000
law and also fluid mechanics the low

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,440
that

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,599
connects with viscosity the stress and

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:35,000
the rate of strain of fluids but there

42
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,360
are also of diagonal terms these are

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,599
called cross

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,519
effects and in

45
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,120
some uh

46
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,920
cases some of these cross effects are

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,640
forbidden by symmetry reasons in

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,680
particular if you have an isotropic

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:01,280
fluid or Continuum

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,280
um the kuri principle forbids

51
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,879
uh

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,879
the cross effects between phenomena of

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,879
different tensorial

54
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,599
character although there are may be

55
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,120
other situations like we said for

56
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,080
example interfaces between

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,200
phases where the

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,360
isotropy is broken by the

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,799
interface and it's substituted by

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,680
another kind of

61
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,680
isotropy that will allow some additional

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,840
coupling that would not be allowed in

63
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,840
the

64
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,640
bulk

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:51,480
okay all right

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,120
so let's uh recall also that we have

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,599
defined

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,840
this uh relations that

69
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:04,760
um um def that um yeah this modee of

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,760
interaction that is the extension of the

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,120
idea of a heat interaction which we call

72
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,840
the Heat and

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,239
diffusion which is fundamental in U in

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,880
that it brings in a relation like the

75
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,600
heat uh Q overt relation here it becomes

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:29,240
a relation between

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,800
heat uh and also additional terms like

78
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,479
this one

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,800
in the uh flux for the energy and also

80
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
for the

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,680
entropy the language that you find in

82
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,919
papers and books on this

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,000
subject uh sometimes

84
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,840
is is varied and so you have to be

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,720
careful uh

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,960
often you find people calling this

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,199
uh

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,240
heat and this is the measurable heat

89
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,199
flux uh I have tried to call heat flux

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,880
only this and that I'll try to call it

91
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,880
just the energy

92
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,919
flux in

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,160
addition in some of the situations in

94
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,319
which you have multiple phenomena

95
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,840
occurring like heat and mass transfer

96
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:32,720
simultaneously or heat and electrical

97
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,160
charge uh

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,319
transfer there are is also languages

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,560
like the the heat of

100
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,759
transfer in some particular situations

101
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,360
for

102
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:49,440
example uh if you have no gradient in

103
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,759
temperature which doesn't necessarily

104
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,759
mean that QP Prime is zero but in in

105
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,120
that situation the overall energy flux

106
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,080
is sometimes

107
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,360
called uh the heat of

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,960
Transport uh because it's it's the heat

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,160
that is transported in the absence of

110
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,000
the traditional uh cause of heat

111
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,120
transfer which is a gradient in

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,039
temperature nevertheless it's it's it's

113
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,840
a combination of these

114
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:25,160
terms so beware of the language and if

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:29,680
you ever have to write on this subject

116
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,680
be careful and be consistent

117
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,560
now when we defined uh the Heat and

118
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:41,319
diffusion interaction we did it

119
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,720
uh for a situation in the absence of

120
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,000
fluid

121
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,960
flow so these

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,199
are the diffusive

123
00:06:47,960 --> 00:07:00,560
flaxes with respect to uh a non-moving

124
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:04,240
uh bulk uh and therefore uh in next

125
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,520
slide we'll have to do a little bit of

126
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:13,479
additional job to introduce also the

127
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:16,919
idea that U typically in fluids there is

128
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,039
flow and of course is a complication it

129
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,720
complicates some some of the equations

130
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,879
but it's h is the right moment to bring

131
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,879
it in and

132
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,199
also

133
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,840
um what

134
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:41,879
else it escaped uh I'll come back and uh

135
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,879
so um so let's dig into this

136
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:48,960
uh a little little crowded slide as

137
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,879
usual but uh it's full of things that we

138
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,400
have already seen so just to have a way

139
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,759
to remember uh for example you remember

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,800
that we U as part of the local equili

141
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,840
assumption and together with a simple

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,000
system

143
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:11,199
model and like what when we describe bul

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,639
flow we say that the energy of our

145
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:19,960
system including like a a fluid

146
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:22,080
parcel is described by the energy of a

147
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,720
stable prop typical of a stable

148
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,400
equilibrium state

149
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,399
with the amounts of entropy volume and

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,120
uh constituency that are in that fluid

151
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,120
element plus additional terms that are

152
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,800
either mechanical or electrical like the

153
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,039
kinetic energy the potential

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,040
gravitational energy the potential

155
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:48,040
electrostatic energy and if you have

156
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,040
also

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,080
um your fluid in

158
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,440
a static in a

159
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:02,240
centrifugal field you can add this

160
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,240
negative potential

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
energy and of course we remember that

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,480
the

163
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,279
mass is related to the

164
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,279
concentrations via the molecular weights

165
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,000
and the charge Q is related to the

166
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:27,560
concentrations via the

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,560
individual charges of uh Z of of your

168
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,560
molecules

169
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,600
so we have seen a few times that when

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,720
you

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,399
do uh compute the derivative of the

172
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,720
energy that enters in the conditions for

173
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,720
Mutual equilibrium which is not the

174
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,279
chemical potential but the total

175
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,600
potential that picks up a contribution

176
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,880
from just the uh stable equilibri state

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,680
property and that's the chemical

178
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,519
potential but then there are also

179
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,880
additional contributions to the chemical

180
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,440
potential which makes it for example if

181
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,920
you add this one it makes it

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,640
electrochemical potential the

183
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,640
gravitational the kinetic and the

184
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,000
centrifugal in a moment uh below we'll

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,680
see that we can write these these terms

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,399
are highlighted in in white uh as energy

187
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,760
minus internal

188
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:32,320
energy because in specific because in in

189
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,680
indeed that is what what what it turns

190
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,680
out to

191
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:46,720
be um in fact you

192
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,600
remember that in general without before

193
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,839
we make any assumptions about mixture

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,240
being ideal or non ideal uh in general

195
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:59,800
we Define the partial properties and

196
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,440
this is the partial internal energy

197
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,240
which is related to the total internal

198
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,600
energy by this

199
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,279
summation which you can also cast in

200
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,279
terms of concentrations

201
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,839
CI so if you substitute if you rewrite

202
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,480
this expression for the

203
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:23,480
energy in terms of you write here in

204
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,880
terms of

205
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,440
energy um specific energy per unit

206
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,560
volume times the volume

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,360
and here you substitute this for the

208
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,040
internal energy which is the first term

209
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,600
here so you see that the overall energy

210
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,360
is given by a summation weighted on the

211
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,720
concentrations of of all these

212
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,399
terms all these terms somewhere have the

213
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,560
concentration coming in either through

214
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,560
the mass or the

215
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,399
charge and so this term in parenthesis

216
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:02,959
can be

217
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:06,880
called the specific um uh energy total

218
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:11,240
energy and uh it can be uh

219
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,240
split like we let's see

220
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,839
here

221
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,720
uh

222
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,720
so uh let's

223
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:30,120
see yeah I get lost myself in my slides

224
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,079
yes

225
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:38,839
sad all right

226
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:41,800
um okay so yeah we write it in terms of

227
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:45,279
uh the the E without is a per unit

228
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,040
volume the E with the star is per unit

229
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:53,079
mass that is also some kind of source of

230
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,440
confusion somewhere in in in in the

231
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:58,600
literature and all right so this is one

232
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,720
first equation the second relation that

233
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,399
we need to bring in is the fact that the

234
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,880
flues the fluxes of

235
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,800
constituents are not all

236
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,240
independent because these remember they

237
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,120
they not they don't have the not on

238
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,600
superscript so these are the um

239
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,519
diffusive

240
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,320
fluxes those so it's the flux relative

241
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:31,000
to the center uh the body center of the

242
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,360
uh of the fluid element

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,360
and with respect to that uh the the mass

244
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,360
flux by definition of bicentric velocity

245
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
is equal to

246
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:51,720
zero uh and

247
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:54,639
therefore the the weighted sum of the

248
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,320
uh mol fluxes of the various

249
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,199
constituents weighted on the molecular

250
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,240
their molecular weight must be equal to

251
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,240
zero that makes them U not all

252
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,160
independent

253
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,320
so we can uh

254
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,279
recast the equations by writing picking

255
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,279
for example the last

256
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,720
one so the flux of the last

257
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,639
constituent this is the mass is equal to

258
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,880
the negative of the sum of the flues of

259
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,880
masses of the the remaining

260
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,680
constituents and we can

261
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:42,519
introduce this

262
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:46,000
idea into the expression that we need

263
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,079
for U the Heat and diffusion interaction

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,240
because there we have the sum and in

265
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,519
this sum we have all the fluxes

266
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,759
playing but we have to also make a

267
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,759
system with this other relation between

268
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,759
fluxes

269
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,079
so one

270
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,680
way is to

271
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:12,079
uh

272
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,079
Rewrite by uh

273
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:19,360
subtracting this equation

274
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:23,600
here we first do it with a mass so that

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,519
this is easier to to to subtract so here

276
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,680
when I see the

277
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,000
summation with it goes from one to R to

278
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,079
the top total amount of constituents now

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,360
I substitute it with the summation that

280
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:39,079
goes from 1 to R

281
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,839
minus1 and the last

282
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:47,560
one is written is is in the is comes in

283
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,560
inside the summation by virtue of this

284
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:57,920
Mass oops what happens Yeah by by virtue

285
00:15:51,040 --> 00:16:00,519
of this Mass uh balance suppos speak

286
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,639
equation no that's not a bu balance it's

287
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,639
simply uh definition of bicentric

288
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:12,240
velocity okay so now once we have this

289
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,920
expression here it's the difference

290
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,880
between the total

291
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,519
potentials but the difference between

292
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,040
the total

293
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:26,279
potentials uh we've seen

294
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,279
um somewhere

295
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:33,959
above I got the mouse stuck moment but

296
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:40,199
uh uh somewhere above you find a

297
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:42,880
relation that U gives you you here this

298
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,880
relation

299
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:52,399
here and uh and that one up up up there

300
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,319
so this

301
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:59,880
difference can be

302
00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:03,799
substituted with uh this

303
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:08,919
one where the Z's uh stand

304
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:10,600
out and they bring in the uh charge uh

305
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,880
the charge

306
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,000
flux

307
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,319
okay and

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,120
um Okay so we've substituted so now this

309
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,839
expression has the advantage that of

310
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,000
having all the fluxes that are

311
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:31,200
independent because you are excluding

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,600
the AR um go the summation only up to R

313
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,440
minus

314
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,440
one then we do the usual trick we

315
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,799
remember that the chemical potential can

316
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,960
be written as H minus

317
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:45,600
TS and this is for the partial

318
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,919
properties so a partial H minus partial

319
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:55,000
partial uh TS which is written

320
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:57,480
here and so you can split U terms in

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,600
these flaxes that are multiplied by the

322
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,200
temperature and terms that are

323
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:08,000
not

324
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:12,120
okay um we can also go back to um molar

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,159
quantities molar fluxes without the

326
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:20,200
stars and uh uh eventually we recognize

327
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:22,880
that this term that is multiplied by T

328
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,320
is what we Define the meas measurable

329
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,360
heat flux or that is the heat flux heat

330
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:34,640
flux of uh heat transfer

331
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:37,760
okay so the bottom line is highlighted

332
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,880
here that we finally have

333
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,799
written the fluxes of energy and entropy

334
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,280
which are needed to make the energy and

335
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,880
entropy balances of course to the flux

336
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:53,640
of heat transfer so the measurable heat

337
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,320
flux to the fluxes of

338
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,760
constituents but not all of them only up

339
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,520
to R minus one and to the uh diffusive

340
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,200
Flux Of of electrical

341
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:11,240
charge so this is uh basic to analyze

342
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,559
any of uh those cross effects that we

343
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,000
need to

344
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:21,240
do now

345
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,600
uh just a little uh detour to mention

346
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,840
that

347
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,840
um since we're talking about fluxes

348
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,919
and we are talking about

349
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,880
uh heat and diffusion interaction then a

350
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,480
legitimate question is well is there

351
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,360
some kind kind some interaction that is

352
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,520
not like uh the Heat and diffusion it's

353
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,039
not like

354
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,559
heat and one important example which

355
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:56,280
also gives me a chance

356
00:19:53,559 --> 00:20:00,600
to mention uh

357
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:03,400
is radiation electr itic radiation

358
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,960
contains not only energy the

359
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,960
photons that come from the Sun for for

360
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,960
example uh they do not have only uh

361
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,960
energy they also have

362
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,400
entropy you can think of actually the

363
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:26,000
the if you remember probably from your

364
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,280
physics uh course is this idea of the

365
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,679
black body radiation in a cavity in a

366
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,960
vacuum cavity you have

367
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,480
photons uh bouncing around and

368
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,720
exchanging with the with the

369
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,480
walls uh now the the electromagnetic

370
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,080
field is is an interesting

371
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:49,600
um subject

372
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:52,720
because if those walls in your uh um

373
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,480
cavity were perfect mirrors so they

374
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,039
wouldn't absorb the photons but they

375
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,360
simply uh bounce them

376
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,480
away uh

377
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,039
um this the modes of the electromagnetic

378
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,159
field would not uh interact with each

379
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:11,960
other so in other words you would have

380
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:16,080
that um photons with a certain frequency

381
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,000
will remain uh remain uh we will not

382
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,799
exchange with photons with another

383
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,159
frequency it is only through the

384
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:27,320
interaction with matter that radiation

385
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:30,520
can move energy from one mode namely one

386
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,520
frequency to another fre

387
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:41,159
uh okay this is all um described by

388
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,840
Plank's uh theory of electromagnetic

389
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:48,960
radiation and these are the typic the

390
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:53,760
well-known Spectra of of the various

391
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,360
items one is energy curve a for energy

392
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,960
curve B is for

393
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,480
entropy p

394
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,480
uh the pressure is

395
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:09,440
C uh and then you get

396
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,440
also yeah we plotted here also

397
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,480
the the functions in terms of instead of

398
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,480
frequency of w

399
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:23,159
wavelength but what is important is

400
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,960
that so the equivalent if you have two

401
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,840
bodies two yes

402
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,679
two two bodies at different temperatur

403
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,360
ta and TB and there is vacuum in between

404
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,240
uh they exchange energy via the

405
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,640
electromagnetic radiation because there

406
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,480
are photons in each of the solid the

407
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:48,600
solid is not uh you can you you think it

408
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,480
is a it is full completely but it's full

409
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,799
of empty space and in that empty space

410
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,919
the photon go in and out okay so the

411
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,039
photon that emerge

412
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:05,200
from one body

413
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:09,960
uh go directly ballistically so to speak

414
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:14,600
in like a ray to enter or to hit the

415
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:17,400
other uh the other solid and vice

416
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,919
versa and if you take if the if the

417
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,840
solids are at stable equilibrium and the

418
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:27,080
electrom Magnetic radiation that leaves

419
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,480
these solids is in equilibrium with that

420
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,360
it has the features of that temperature

421
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,039
so this the photons that come out of

422
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:38,360
body a have the temperature

423
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:40,159
ta and and and then they they arrive to

424
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,159
uh to system

425
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,120
B and that is a non equilibrium

426
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:49,480
situation they they have to interact and

427
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,880
thermalize and so by interacting and

428
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:57,480
being absorbed and and re emitted by the

429
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:02,799
molecules of of body B There is a a

430
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:06,720
remesal of um of the energy it's like in

431
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:10,279
the collisions that we talked about that

432
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,520
um that is an

433
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:17,600
irreversible fact and

434
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:21,039
then that allows thermalization of these

435
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,520
photons so

436
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:27,200
the so Sigma time T to 4 Sigma is the

437
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Stefan bolman constant it's written down

438
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,919
here sure remember

439
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,240
um so the this Sigma t to the four is

440
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:39,559
the is the amount of energy that goes

441
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,640
out is the body a and and this is the

442
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:45,559
one that goes out of body B so they

443
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,559
exchange so the net exchange is the

444
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,559
difference and and together with the uh

445
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,159
Sigma to the T to the 4th which is very

446
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:59,760
well known there is also a 43 Sigma T to

447
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,960
the3 for the entropy that goes with it

448
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,399
so these photons do not carry only

449
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,520
energy they also carry

450
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:09,960
entropy like the photons that come from

451
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,559
the

452
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,399
sun the sun has photons that on the

453
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,279
surface have temperature of the order of

454
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,840
what is it 50

455
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,720
57

456
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:28,760
5760

457
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:32,600
k um and those Photon leaves the uh the

458
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,760
plasma that is on the surface of of of

459
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,600
the sunand that we've seen very well

460
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:44,320
during the eclipse the other day and uh

461
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,080
they all the way travel to here to the

462
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,000
Earth and they

463
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,120
carry the features of energy and entropy

464
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,520
proper of that

465
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,320
temperature the fact that it that they

466
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,159
have

467
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,279
entropy limits the amount ount of work

468
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,960
that you can do with that energy so it's

469
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:10,520
not entire you cannot extract

470
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,200
100% of energy because of that entropy

471
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,000
that's the remember that when we talked

472
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,600
about um I think in the allocation

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,120
chapter we talked about the exergy of

474
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,080
solar radiation being around 93 okay

475
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,159
that is where part of the story it comes

476
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,279
from this anop

477
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,039
content but of course you can also uh

478
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,360
not

479
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:40,679
only uh talk about the flux overall flux

480
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,919
of energy carried by these photons but

481
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,000
also you can uh talk about the flux of

482
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,520
energy carried by each mode of the

483
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,320
electromagnetic

484
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,480
field so it's do this per frequency and

485
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,240
you can do that energy wise but also

486
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,320
entropy wise so this is the

487
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,720
uh the flux that

488
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,080
is exchanged between body a and body B

489
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,159
at temperature

490
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,760
T via photons of that frequency uh new

491
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,799
or or if you want you can write it also

492
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,080
in terms of

493
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,520
wavelength okay so in this paper that we

494
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,480
wrote long ago and then we was

495
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:29,039
republished recently uh you find all

496
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:33,880
these formulas that are used if you are

497
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,880
in the solar energy

498
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,840
business so let's go back now to

499
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:48,360
um uh the formula for the entropy

500
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,399
production which will be the starting

501
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:57,440
point for our

502
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,440
applications and we do uh

503
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,120
uh also here we we want

504
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,399
to introduce the

505
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:18,159
um the fact that use the fact that is a

506
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,399
fluxes are not all independent and

507
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,440
rewrite this

508
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,919
expression in which that you I don't go

509
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,760
over it because we've we we've talked

510
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,640
about it so many times but but we not

511
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,880
now want to concentrate only on this

512
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,600
term which has to do with the diffusion

513
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,440
of

514
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,000
particles uh and we want to rewrite it

515
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,760
in a form that goes only up to R to the

516
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,760
minus one or essentially that it is

517
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,600
written in terms of uh independent

518
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,880
fluxes and one way of doing it is

519
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,039
through these uh

520
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,760
steps because

521
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:03,840
now uh we also have to remember that um

522
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,600
the gradient in the chemical

523
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,480
potentials which appear appears

524
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:14,720
here uh this is the gradient done at

525
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:18,080
keeping the temperature constant um is

526
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,919
uh they are not all independent either

527
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,080
because of the Gibs doen relation

528
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,880
remember the Gibs do relation is written

529
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,799
here it Sayes that it says that the the

530
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,880
weighted sum of those

531
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,679
those gradients of chemical potentials

532
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,080
weighted on the concentrations of the

533
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,399
element of the

534
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,679
constituents is related is gives the

535
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,159
gradient in the

536
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,399
pressure remember that the pressure we

537
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,480
managed to make it disappear somehow

538
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,080
from by working in terms of properties

539
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,120
per unit volume but here it's where it

540
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,279
uh

541
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,279
reappears via the gbsd relation

542
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,360
uh now I let you play with with with

543
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:11,000
with the math here it explains

544
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,519
how the fact that if you have a relation

545
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,760
like this you can rewrite it uh in this

546
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,760
other

547
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,960
form just playing with um summing and

548
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:29,000
subtracting zeros and

549
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:31,519
U the the good uh thing is that if you

550
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,519
that now the right hand side of this

551
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,519
expression has

552
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,760
differences between chemical

553
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,559
potentials and

554
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,080
therefore this summation which goes

555
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:47,519
still from one to R but effectively goes

556
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,880
to R2 to minus one because when J is

557
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,880
equal to I this difference is

558
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,880
zero

559
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:04,519
okay so this is the first step that we

560
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,519
make we substitute this into

561
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,159
here and next once we have this

562
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,880
expression like

563
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,880
this again I let you play with the mafia

564
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,559
it's an expression of this uh type in

565
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,200
which it happens that the coefficients

566
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:26,080
that multiply here are in variant upon

567
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,639
exchange of I and

568
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:34,559
J and that symm allows you to add and

569
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:37,919
subtract um or to rewrite this ter this

570
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,880
summation by exchanging those indexes

571
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,080
and

572
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,360
then subtracting the two and uh

573
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,880
essentially you can get these

574
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,480
identity which we apply

575
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,519
there so now we can we have a this nice

576
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,600
expression in which we have the

577
00:31:52,519 --> 00:32:00,039
summation it's a double

578
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,720
summation but it it has a number of zero

579
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:04,399
elements because every time it's all

580
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,000
written in terms of difference between

581
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,880
fluxes and differences between chemical

582
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,080
potentials which also has the advantage

583
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:19,320
that um uh makes it reference frame

584
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,639
independent because those are are fluxes

585
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,279
with respect to the bicentric

586
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:28,320
velocity so they depend on a reference

587
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,960
frame which is the bicentric one the one

588
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,960
that follows the

589
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,200
lran local uh following your fluid

590
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,720
element but if you take the difference

591
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,799
between the two then the difference is

592
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,720
independent of that frame and that is

593
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,720
also an

594
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,080
advantage so

595
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,399
finally yes we bring back uh uh the

596
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,600
pressure here

597
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,799
and uh we but we have this summation

598
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:09,279
which is expressed in terms of these

599
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:13,000
differences that we now rename so j i j

600
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,320
is the flux of particles of species I

601
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,120
with respect to particles of species J

602
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,799
so for example if you have a um the

603
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,279
water vapor that comes out of your

604
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:28,799
shower and you so it's those water

605
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:33,080
molecules travel in the air and go and

606
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:36,440
get your mirrors wet okay so that's

607
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:41,720
that's diffusion of particles of water

608
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:45,320
vapor and uh and of course uh the the

609
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,480
room that is made uh empty by those

610
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,360
particles of water vapor that goes away

611
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:55,919
are filled by the air molecules so there

612
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:59,559
is a a crossing of flows okay so here

613
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,240
we're talking about so j i J is the is

614
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:04,600
the is the Flux Of partic of the water

615
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,559
vapor with respect to the motion of to

616
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,800
the mo to the motion of the uh of the

617
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,599
air

618
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,480
molecules so it's a relative

619
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:18,320
flux and also

620
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,960
these chemical potential differences

621
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,240
that are also written here we can think

622
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,679
of them as the conjugates or this

623
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,679
relative forces

624
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:47,359
okay all right so now if we

625
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,639
uh we take this expression here we

626
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,560
substitute what we get here so we get a

627
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,280
term with the with gradient in the

628
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,680
pressure and we also have the term with

629
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,599
the dissipation function for from food

630
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,560
mechanics let's forget about those so

631
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:06,320
let's suppose we take no flow

632
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,240
and no yeah no flow so we move with the

633
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:14,119
with the

634
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:17,200
uh perhaps we have a box with um

635
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,880
particles that are steady with respect

636
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,599
to the laboratory

637
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,720
frame and let's suppose we are at

638
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,280
uniform

639
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,079
pressure and also we have no chemical

640
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,599
reactions then we are left with these

641
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:34,320
three terms and these are the three

642
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:38,720
terms that will allow us to

643
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,440
uh Define the the thermo diffusion and

644
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,839
the

645
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,960
thermoelectric phenomena that we are

646
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,280
interested in in dealing with as

647
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:53,319
examples of these cross

648
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,319
effects so this will be our starting

649
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,040
point um

650
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,000
so let's uh so let's take let's start

651
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:11,160
with the thermoelectric

652
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,880
effects as the more or less simple

653
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,960
example uh of uh of the procedure that

654
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,400
we need in order to to understand

655
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,240
it we start from this expression that of

656
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,119
the entropy production that we just uh

657
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,720
uh reviewed

658
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,720
and in this

659
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:40,280
case there is only one uh uh particle

660
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,520
which is the

661
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:47,160
electrons in your conductor or

662
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,800
semiconductor or or the or the holes in

663
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,920
the uh in the

664
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,560
semiconductor okay so

665
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,920
charges but a single a single

666
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,119
constituent it it means that the there

667
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,079
is no uh

668
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,880
diffusive

669
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,839
flux uh with anything else

670
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,920
so the term the term that we had a

671
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,599
couple of slides ago so this one this

672
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,200
one does oops sorry this one doesn't

673
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,800
contribute uh because there is no

674
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,839
relative motion with with anything it's

675
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,839
there is only one type of

676
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,800
particle

677
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,480
okay and here I I have highlighted in

678
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,319
blue and

679
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,240
red uh the flux and the conjugated

680
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:40,359
entropic uh

681
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:44,119
Force you'll see in a moment

682
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:47,240
why I I suggest that when

683
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:50,000
you do this you always start from this

684
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:53,480
entropic point of view because that's

685
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,079
the only safe place in which you can U

686
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,560
uh in which you can apply on Saga

687
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,160
relations without making

688
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,319
too many

689
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:07,920
mistakes all right so the next

690
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:10,200
step remember this is the extrinsic

691
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,000
relation it doesn't contain any feature

692
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,000
yet of your

693
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,079
material now in order to uh bring in the

694
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,960
features of the material you have to

695
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:27,720
model the relation between the fluxes

696
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,440
and the forces

697
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,680
and if we assume a linear Force flux

698
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,280
relation because we assume that we are

699
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,040
near equilibrium and so

700
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,760
on this is uh the most General linear

701
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:48,119
relation between these fluxes and these

702
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:50,359
forces and it has a a matrix of

703
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,920
coefficients which is the onager Matrix

704
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:56,160
of coefficients actually in this um

705
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,760
slide these are

706
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,480
tensors because because if you remember

707
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,880
suppose we didn't have uh suppose we had

708
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,119
only um Fier law for La is a linear

709
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,280
relation between the Heat flux which is

710
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,880
a vector and the gradient in Temper in

711
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,560
inverse temperature which is also vector

712
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,280
and the most General relation is through

713
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,800
a tensor which is the conductivity

714
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,480
tensor K double double underline that we

715
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,160
have already discussed and which is

716
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,480
symmetric by uh yag principle

717
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,960
here we have added also uh relations

718
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,960
with other tensors so this would be

719
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:41,480
instead the relation between electrical

720
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:44,000
current is current density so it's the

721
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,000
flux of

722
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:51,119
charge yeah I'm calling it now uh I

723
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,240
double Prime I should have

724
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,960
probably more

725
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,720
consistently called it uh JQ so the

726
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,319
the diffusive flat of charge because

727
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,720
this is still diffusive but since our

728
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:06,800
solid is a solid is not moving uh there

729
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,800
is no convective part of the of the

730
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,880
charge and so it's it's they are the

731
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,599
same so just to make it more appealing

732
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,640
to the idea that we're talking about

733
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,400
electrical current something that you

734
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,280
measure in a wire

735
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,680
and okay and so this is ohms this is

736
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,560
Ohm's Law if you take only this last

737
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,640
term the relation between current and

738
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,280
the gradient in potential is the the

739
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,040
thing that you measure in voltage with

740
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,839
the

741
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,359
voltmeter in

742
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,520
volts T is to is one /

743
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:47,880
T and

744
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:50,760
L is the um

745
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,319
resistivity of your

746
00:40:50,760 --> 00:41:00,400
material which you would measure

747
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:03,359
in uh oh per me I guess and um and it is

748
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,640
a tensor also so if your material is

749
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,000
isotropic that tensor reduces to just

750
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,200
the one number one one scalar but if it

751
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,800
is an isotropic exactly like we have

752
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:19,000
seen for for heat transfer you would

753
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,520
have different uh principal directions

754
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,839
of where the where the where the

755
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,119
electrical current likes to run easier

756
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:30,839
than in other directions

757
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:33,000
okay so this is the first step assume

758
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:35,040
linear flux

759
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,720
relations

760
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,440
next what we typically

761
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:45,040
do is to

762
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,319
rewrite uh so re rearrange these

763
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,880
equations by bringing in more familiar

764
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,200
variables and in this case the more

765
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,880
familiar variable is simply the

766
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,240
temperature instead of tow so this is

767
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,240
one / t

768
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,319
uh but we also want to rewrite it in a

769
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,760
different way so we want in the first

770
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,760
equation to substitute this term here

771
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,760
with the electric

772
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,960
current so what we do is take the second

773
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,599
equation and extract the gradient in Fe

774
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,040
from the second

775
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,280
equation that we will then substitute in

776
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,680
the first

777
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,119
one so this is what we doing so we take

778
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,079
this we solve of course these are

779
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:37,559
tensors so in order to solve you have to

780
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,440
multiply to the right from the left with

781
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:45,599
the inverse of

782
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:47,599
this tensor uh which which it exists

783
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,359
because the tensor is positive definite

784
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,920
because of

785
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,640
uh because of the principle of entropy

786
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,559
non

787
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,599
decrease uh so you do that you get the

788
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:04,480
graded in feed you substitute up there

789
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,920
and here's what you get as a result so

790
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,319
you get now a relation between the Heat

791
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,280
flux the gradient in

792
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,640
temperature and the electrical

793
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,640
current and of

794
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,319
course the substitution that you've made

795
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,920
since the the gradient in in in the

796
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:29,000
electric field I'm sorry in the electro

797
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,960
electric potential

798
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,280
um depends on the current but also on

799
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,880
the gradient in

800
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,079
temperature when you substitute it up

801
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,000
there it gives its own contribution to

802
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,960
the term that multiplies the factor the

803
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,720
preactor of the gradient in temperature

804
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,559
so and that's why you see this

805
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:53,359
difference so this is the

806
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:55,880
direct say for like kind of term and

807
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:59,119
this is the

808
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,359
indirect the due to

809
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:07,160
uh

810
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:11,559
the due to the the flow of of charges of

811
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,359
electrons okay so and then

812
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,240
finally

813
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:20,599
we instead of carrying all these names

814
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,599
with the L's we just give different

815
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,160
names so uh the term that multiplies in

816
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,079
this equation um

817
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,640
the gradient in

818
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,680
temperature we call it

819
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,680
Epsilon and that's called the

820
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,680
cack

821
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,119
coefficient this other term we call it

822
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,079
the

823
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,079
electrical resistivity of the

824
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,880
material

825
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,680
[Music]

826
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:59,000
um so the L was was the conductivity

827
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:03,680
electrical conductivity I I I spoke

828
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,240
before now this combination of Els here

829
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,319
with the minus the one / t^2 we call it

830
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:12,839
uh thermal

831
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,800
conductivity and this last one we call

832
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:18,440
it the Peltier

833
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,599
coefficient and here we repeat their

834
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,599
definitions just for

835
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,240
clarity next we're not done yet

836
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,319
because these four numbers these four

837
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,760
properties these are equilibrium

838
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,800
properties they are uh remember that

839
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:44,160
this is a linearization around

840
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:46,720
equilibrium so these are measured at

841
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,720
equilibrium and uh they are not all

842
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,520
independent because there is the unag

843
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,119
principle of reciprocity so l12 is equal

844
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,720
to

845
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,240
l21 more precisely since we're talking

846
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,400
about 10 s you to think

847
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,880
of this big this is a big system in

848
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,640
which you have three equ three equations

849
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,319
here for the components of the heat flux

850
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:14,319
and three equations here for the

851
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:14,319
components of the uh current

852
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,680
density uh so you have so it's a 6X

853
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:27,599
six which you can

854
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:33,240
U cast in this more compact way but this

855
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,240
6x6 Matrix has to be uh

856
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,000
symmetric by the unag

857
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,920
reciprocity and so this

858
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
symmetry

859
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:50,040
requires that each of uh the groups

860
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,480
these um blocks that we have defined of

861
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:58,160
these Matrix are symmetric themselves

862
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:01,880
and also that these off diagonal are um

863
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:06,040
uh one equal to the to to the

864
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,040
other so if you apply that

865
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,160
symmetry you may uh

866
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:15,000
notice let's

867
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,400
see yeah you may notice that there is a

868
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,240
relation between the Peltier tensor and

869
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:25,000
the CC

870
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:28,319
tensor you take the transpose of the

871
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,520
PTI the transpose of the product of

872
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,950
matrixes uh you know when you do the

873
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,000
transpose you have to also change the

874
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,440
[Music]

875
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,280
order the product of the

876
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:44,520
transposed and then you apply uh

877
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,599
onager symmetry so this the T goes

878
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,800
away and here

879
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:52,800
comes something that is contained in

880
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:56,000
CC except the temperature so essentially

881
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,240
you find that the transpose of PTI is

882
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,800
equal to the temper temperature times CC

883
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,640
and of course if the material is

884
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,599
isotropic these tensors simplify to

885
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,720
simple scalars multiplied by the

886
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:14,079
identity tensor which is Matrix with all

887
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:17,760
ones on the diagonal and zeros outside

888
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,599
and and so the Onaga reciprocity implies

889
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,520
that the ptia coefficient is equal to

890
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,440
temperature times the C

891
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,520
effect moreover you can

892
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,680
also re

893
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,960
in terms of the these new uh uh

894
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,000
properties of of these

895
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:40,480
materials

896
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,480
material uh you can rewrite the the

897
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,480
entropy

898
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,160
production and you would like to like it

899
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,520
to write it in a canonical form just to

900
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:58,400
make sure that uh uh it is that your

901
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,200
model uh does indeed respect the

902
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,319
principle of entropy on decrease so

903
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:07,440
these are

904
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:10,319
quadratic canonical form and these are

905
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,559
quadratic forms which as you see they

906
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,240
are and you can write it in this way

907
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,960
also in this other

908
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,799
one a single quadratic

909
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:26,240
form

910
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:28,400
okay so let's see an example of uh where

911
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,799
we use the CC

912
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,079
effect uh every day in the lab which is

913
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:34,079
the

914
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,160
thermocouple so you see we started from

915
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,480
the general linear

916
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,079
relations and we ended up with these

917
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,079
other

918
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:56,359
relations now uh yeah let me go back one

919
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:57,960
moment sorry um I want to show you this

920
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,880
um

921
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,920
already at this

922
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,920
stage if I change one /

923
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,799
T and write the equations in terms of

924
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:16,480
temperature and not the inverse

925
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:21,000
temperature look what happens that

926
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,720
um just that little step makes you lose

927
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,760
the

928
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,000
Symmetry because l12 is equal to l21

929
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,799
but this coefficient here is divided by

930
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,880
T this is divided by

931
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:36,559
t^2 so they are not equal to one another

932
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,720
so if

933
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,520
you uh by mistake started

934
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,799
from or say say well who cares I mean

935
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,760
temp temperature or inverse temperature

936
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:53,640
so you took the wrong U so it's not the

937
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:55,880
temperature the um the witness of non

938
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:58,359
equilibrium the the degree of this

939
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,280
equilibrium uh it's the it's the

940
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:06,880
gradient of the inverse temperature so

941
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:06,880
that is minus 1 / t^ 2 time T so that is

942
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:15,440
the so this is why I I say U you better

943
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:18,040
be careful and start always from the

944
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,520
entropic point of view and and and the

945
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,760
proper degrees of dise equilibrium

946
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:26,240
otherwise you may you may end up

947
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,160
thinking that there are symmetries where

948
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,799
they

949
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:33,319
there are

950
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:33,319
not and you get wrong relations of

951
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,880
course even more so uh

952
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,880
here and the Symmetry between the this

953
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,359
and

954
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:58,400
that is uh there is a temperature in

955
00:51:53,359 --> 00:52:00,839
between because beler is a um C time

956
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,640
times the temperature

957
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:08,119
okay right so what uh what is this

958
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,559
example so the if we apply these

959
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:12,319
equations

960
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:16,440
to an electric current that runs in a

961
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:16,440
wire in which there is a temperature

962
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,440
gradient uh okay then you have this

963
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,160
expression here that relates the

964
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,480
temperature gradient the electric

965
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:33,400
current

966
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,400
and the voltage drop along the the the

967
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:43,559
wire uh now a wire is a one-dimensional

968
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,400
thing so you can uh describe

969
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,200
it

970
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,680
uh

971
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,680
by set of

972
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,400
coordinates which is

973
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:02,839
a um like this so a local set of

974
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:07,240
coordinates where one versor is tangent

975
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:09,720
to the axis of the of your wire and the

976
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,720
other two are

977
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:19,119
orthogonal and and then you have these

978
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:24,319
vectors so these vectors are uh let's

979
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:27,040
say the gradient in Fe as a

980
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,839
vector but the important

981
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,960
part if you want to compute the

982
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:35,760
difference in voltage between 0.1 and

983
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,480
02 uh you have to

984
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:44,240
integrate the component of the gradient

985
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:46,200
in fe uh projected on to DL onto the

986
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,280
direction of the wire and and integrate

987
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:52,680
so you do the integral of D Fe dotted

988
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,680
into

989
00:53:52,799 --> 00:54:01,000
DL from one to two and that gives you

990
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,359
the difference in voltage what is it V2

991
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,359
minus

992
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:09,079
V1 okay now it turns

993
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,839
out um I don't know if you have seen

994
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:19,319
this but this is easy to do so the

995
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:24,280
gradient remember what it is is

996
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:24,280
um this operator here

997
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:37,040
and

998
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:39,520
DL is also a vector which has as

999
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,880
component

1000
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,880
DX the

1001
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:50,640
y d

1002
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,040
z so now what we're doing here is taking

1003
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:56,799
the scalar

1004
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:58,640
product of this applied onto the scalar

1005
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,440
Fe scalar

1006
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,559
Fe so when you do the dot product of two

1007
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,280
vectors you get the

1008
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:09,119
multiplication of these two so the

1009
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:12,839
multiplication is going to be the

1010
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:15,799
derivative of Fe with respect to X time

1011
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:19,119
DX from these two that these two

1012
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:21,680
components plus the derivative of V with

1013
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,680
respect to

1014
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:28,599
y n

1015
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:31,960
z okay and what is this well this is the

1016
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:35,839
expression for the differential of

1017
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:39,799
Fe okay so you can rewrite this term

1018
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:43,559
here as D Fe and therefore the integral

1019
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:43,559
is very easy it's just F2 minus

1020
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,760
F1

1021
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:58,079
okay which is what we do

1022
00:55:53,799 --> 00:56:00,680
here now we are doing

1023
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:06,200
it the

1024
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:08,839
thermocouple has um has to have two uh

1025
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,760
different uh materials so two different

1026
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:14,119
uh

1027
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,799
conductors uh here we call it a and we

1028
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,960
call it

1029
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:24,559
B that

1030
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:27,480
are joint uh with a with the with a good

1031
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,000
conducting uh

1032
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,960
uh

1033
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,599
Junction

1034
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,599
um here and

1035
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:45,160
here and

1036
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:48,520
um at the other end in this

1037
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:51,079
place uh they are not touching so they

1038
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:54,640
are just it's an open circuit so that

1039
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:57,200
there is no current

1040
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,680
circulating and you will

1041
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,680
measure a voltage differences if there

1042
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,359
is

1043
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,920
any now in order to compute that voltage

1044
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:07,920
difference you need to do that

1045
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:16,799
integral uh three times from one to

1046
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:21,720
two with metal

1047
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:27,760
a from two to three with metal D and

1048
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,760
from three to four again with metal a

1049
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,559
and what are we

1050
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,280
integrating well the the governing

1051
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,200
equation is this one but since we are at

1052
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:41,359
open circuit there is no current so

1053
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,920
there is no uh the current is equal to

1054
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:47,880
zero so the remaining stuff is this

1055
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:51,920
simple relation between the gradient in

1056
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,920
Fe and the gradient in

1057
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:58,119
temperature so you do those three in

1058
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:07,920
integrals you cannot assume you should

1059
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,119
not assume that Epsilon the C

1060
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,240
coefficient is constant and so it goes

1061
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,799
out of the integral yeah you could but

1062
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,599
that would that would be an

1063
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:17,880
approximation unless you use the proper

1064
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:21,960
average in that temperature range

1065
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:24,160
because C coefficients are functions of

1066
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,960
temperature

1067
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,680
um so let's keep them inside the

1068
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,359
integrals this

1069
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:36,480
way and then of course since at the

1070
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:39,000
Junctions the the there is electrical um

1071
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,720
continuity uh

1072
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,440
the voltage so the electrostatic

1073
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:51,160
potential is always is

1074
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:53,160
equal and so now you can add these three

1075
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,200
uh

1076
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,760
equations and what you are left with

1077
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,760
with is

1078
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:06,160
this that F4 so voltage at four minus

1079
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,520
voltage at one is equal to this integral

1080
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:13,200
from 3 to two

1081
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,079
um yeah because you're combining this

1082
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:20,200
and that which are the integral or

1083
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:24,039
Epsilon a into a single integral from uh

1084
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:26,599
from four to from three to four and then

1085
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:29,480
from one to two why because

1086
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:31,000
at uh at four and one they you are

1087
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,720
assuming the same temperature this is

1088
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,880
the laboratory temperature the place

1089
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:39,160
where you put your thermometer so you

1090
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,160
assume that T1 is equal to

1091
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,559
T4 and therefore you get this difference

1092
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:49,520
and sometimes you call this

1093
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:52,520
difference or actually each the generic

1094
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,160
integral of this difference between a

1095
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,799
reference temperature and a generic

1096
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,319
temperature is called the characteristic

1097
00:59:55,799 --> 01:00:00,160
fun function of the thermocouple of the

1098
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:02,839
couple of of the

1099
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:07,119
materials and here are some plots of

1100
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:07,119
those types of

1101
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:12,039
thermocouples that

1102
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:16,480
means at the end of this calculation

1103
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,240
what's the final

1104
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:23,280
result that we may have a difference in

1105
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:26,599
in voltage measured by our voltmeter if

1106
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,400
there is a difference in temperature es

1107
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:33,720
between two and three T2 and

1108
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:36,000
T3 and of course in order to have this

1109
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:39,599
voltage you need that

1110
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
the uh characteristic function of that

1111
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,640
thermocouple be

1112
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,640
different at these two

1113
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,920
temperatures

1114
01:00:53,599 --> 01:01:02,760
this function here

1115
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:06,960
is um is the function that you uh do

1116
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:09,319
when you calibrate in your lab when you

1117
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,319
buy a thermocouple you should do

1118
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:14,319
calibration uh or maybe you buy it

1119
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:17,520
certified so that it comes with a

1120
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:21,079
calibration and calibration is that

1121
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,160
somebody has actually measured this for

1122
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:24,400
your

1123
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,240
thermocouple

1124
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,680
because yeah you could do it

1125
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:34,440
theoretically but uh small uh variations

1126
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:37,720
in in the section cross-section of your

1127
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:42,319
material or some impurity of along the

1128
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:45,079
wires may may result in a different

1129
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:48,520
different uh features and properties of

1130
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:54,720
your wires so you always work with we

1131
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,720
always need to do a calibration for your

1132
01:01:54,839 --> 01:02:01,279
thermocap now the nice uh thing is that

1133
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:06,000
therefore you have uh here something hot

1134
01:02:01,279 --> 01:02:06,000
here something cold and you generate a

1135
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,520
voltage so you so if I have a a hot

1136
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,319
Reservoir and a cold Reservoir and I

1137
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,839
want to produce

1138
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:21,400
electricity

1139
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:23,200
thermocouple can be made to function as

1140
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,799
a generator no this is the

1141
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:30,000
thermoelectric generator which is

1142
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,000
exactly what I just

1143
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,480
said the difference is that now it's a

1144
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,400
generator so I don't want just to

1145
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:43,520
measure the voltage difference but I

1146
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:44,960
want to do something useful like uh run

1147
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:49,559
an electrical

1148
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:53,160
engine uh light up some light

1149
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:53,160
or use that

1150
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,839
electricity so I have attach a load an

1151
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:02,160
electrical load to the two places where

1152
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,279
before I was attaching the

1153
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,440
voltmeter and electric Flow Electric

1154
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:09,359
current will start flowing because that

1155
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,839
voltage will

1156
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:16,279
cause

1157
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:19,559
flow of of electrons but then that what

1158
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:21,240
uh what does it um what does it do if

1159
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:23,279
there is a current that goes from four

1160
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:28,400
to one there is also a current inside

1161
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:31,440
the um wires that goes all the way

1162
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:35,559
around so when I do the calculation for

1163
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:37,279
the voltage I also need to uh take into

1164
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:39,680
account

1165
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:43,480
now uh the other part of the equation

1166
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:46,079
the one that has to do with uh the

1167
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,760
electrical current so I have to adap for

1168
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,160
the voltage

1169
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,160
drop oh

1170
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:59,039
slow so the

1171
01:03:54,359 --> 01:04:04,319
voltage goes down the more current you

1172
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,319
have uh the the lower the

1173
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,200
voltage and

1174
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:14,559
uh you could actually

1175
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:19,960
go all the way to short if you short the

1176
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:22,880
um thing you have uh the highest

1177
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:26,920
current

1178
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,359
but it's all dissipated in Jewel effect

1179
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,359
in

1180
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:36,720
heating okay so now I have a voltage the

1181
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:39,440
actual voltage multiplied by the current

1182
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:42,640
that goes through my device the one that

1183
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:47,359
uses that electrical energy voltage

1184
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:53,559
times current is the electrical work the

1185
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:56,520
power volts amp Watts okay so that's the

1186
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:59,279
electrical power

1187
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:01,799
which is given uh

1188
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:05,039
by this expression

1189
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:08,319
here and as you see there is a a jewel

1190
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,359
effect dissipation so the highest the

1191
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:12,640
higher is

1192
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:14,599
this uh the more I more inefficient is

1193
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,880
my my

1194
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,920
engine the problem is that if I want to

1195
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,880
make this zero I have to make I zero so

1196
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,880
I also get zero

1197
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:31,599
work so there is a compromise and one

1198
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,599
way is to compute the maximum

1199
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:36,559
power and so the maximum power is just

1200
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:40,279
take the derivative of this with respect

1201
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:44,440
to I and set it equal to zero that gives

1202
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:46,920
you this uh value for the electric

1203
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,279
current and you substitute in there and

1204
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,920
you get

1205
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:52,920
the the maximum power

1206
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:02,440
which goes you see as the

1207
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:05,039
square of the difference between the CC

1208
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,920
coefficients of the your two materials

1209
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,920
these material

1210
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,279
pairs notice that

1211
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,799
also

1212
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:19,799
um not only for the thermoelectric

1213
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:22,960
generator in which there is electrical

1214
01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:22,960
current but also for the

1215
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:29,119
thermocouple let me go back one moment

1216
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:31,839
uh we focused a lot on in order to do

1217
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:36,319
this calculation on the first equation

1218
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:39,079
but also the second equation is in place

1219
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:41,760
and and in addition this we should also

1220
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:46,079
remember that this is a an irreversible

1221
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:48,079
phenomenon it's it's driven by uh

1222
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,240
entropy

1223
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,599
generation and in

1224
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:59,960
fact there is

1225
01:06:53,599 --> 01:07:03,559
a heat Q Prime that runs across runs

1226
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:05,319
down from along the the wire because the

1227
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:07,039
wire is an electric conductor but it's

1228
01:07:05,319 --> 01:07:08,160
also a thermal conductor it has a

1229
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,680
thermal

1230
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:16,319
conductivity and it has a p coefficient

1231
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:19,599
so it it uh it moves uh

1232
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:22,359
heat both for two reasons one is the

1233
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:24,480
gradient in temperature along the wire

1234
01:07:22,359 --> 01:07:27,520
and the other is the electrical current

1235
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,520
that uh

1236
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:35,480
uh how do you say carries with it some

1237
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,799
heat that's the P

1238
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,480
effect which is this this

1239
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:45,599
proportionality

1240
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,599
here so that heat is

1241
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,559
dissipated and uh

1242
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:52,960
produces of course it produces the

1243
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,720
effect you could also think of it in the

1244
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,160
other way around it's that it's the the

1245
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,760
heat that flows drags also the

1246
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,720
electrical

1247
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:06,279
charges to together with with the flow

1248
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,200
of of of heat and and that that is why

1249
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:10,279
electrical charges accumulate on one

1250
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:16,520
side of the thermocouple and that's how

1251
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:16,520
you make measure the the voltage

1252
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,080
okay so it's the combination of the

1253
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:29,480
two so this same equation gives rise to

1254
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,480
the Peltier

1255
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,520
effect the peler

1256
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:45,440
effect uh you you can see it uh here it

1257
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:48,359
emerges from this second equation more

1258
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:50,560
directly uh and the typical setup is

1259
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:53,120
that you have a junction between two

1260
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,199
different materials in which you run an

1261
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,560
electric current so you uh they have to

1262
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:58,000
be

1263
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,400
conductor or

1264
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,600
semiconductors so you have to have

1265
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:05,839
possibility to drive a current through

1266
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:10,279
this Junction from Material a to

1267
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:13,520
material B so that's the current

1268
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:15,920
I and let's assume for a moment that you

1269
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,920
can uh that you are

1270
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:23,400
um uh keeping no gradient in temperature

1271
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:26,159
so the temperature is uniform throughout

1272
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:29,279
here so this term in the equ is not

1273
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:31,520
there and you but but but you still have

1274
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:35,920
the equation it says that the the heat

1275
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:39,080
flux is proportional to the uh electric

1276
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,799
current but the problem is that this

1277
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:44,480
proportionality uh coefficient is

1278
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:46,880
different from Material a and material

1279
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,400
B so at the

1280
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,199
junction whereas the electric current

1281
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:54,000
must be continuous because we cannot

1282
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:54,000
create a

1283
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,719
charge so at the junction there is a

1284
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,760
continuity so the the electric current

1285
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,040
that comes from a is the same that goes

1286
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,040
into

1287
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,920
B but this also this equation also says

1288
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:13,320
that the the heat

1289
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:17,320
QA uh is given by this and here I have

1290
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:20,080
another heat which is given by this and

1291
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:22,360
it's different because the p of B is

1292
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:26,880
different from P of

1293
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:30,000
a so there is a jump

1294
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,400
here in the heat

1295
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:39,159
Flux Of course jump in a heat

1296
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:40,760
flux wouldn't satisfy the energy balance

1297
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:45,159
unless

1298
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:49,400
uh the there is energy coming from

1299
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:52,159
somewhere so essentially this jump calls

1300
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:55,520
in for the balance of energy that is

1301
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:59,199
needed to for it to to exist and

1302
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,840
therefore it this Junction transforms

1303
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:04,080
into either a cooler or a heater

1304
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,440
depending on the

1305
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,880
difference of the Peltier coefficients

1306
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:13,360
and the direction of the current so if

1307
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:16,120
you choose a Peltier pair in which say

1308
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,000
pi b is greater than Pi

1309
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:21,080
a

1310
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,600
then and you run the electric current in

1311
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:27,199
this way so that this is

1312
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:31,080
positive then QB is greater than

1313
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:33,640
QA so that means you need to provide

1314
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,800
energy so that means this Junction

1315
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,400
becomes a

1316
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:42,280
cooler this is the Peltier cooling

1317
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:46,639
effect this is what you obtain when you

1318
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:48,679
buy ptsl something that you can buy on

1319
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:52,320
on the internet now for a couple of

1320
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:55,639
bucks and uh and

1321
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,960
uh or you can make it simply if you have

1322
01:11:55,639 --> 01:12:00,719
a

1323
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:03,120
thermocouple also a thermocouple is

1324
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,960
a where you have a junction between two

1325
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,120
different materials you have the

1326
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:12,199
possibility of using this

1327
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:15,960
effect the nice aspect of the P effect

1328
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:18,440
and also a nice aspect I forgot to say

1329
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,440
it about

1330
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:29,960
the thermoelectric generator is that um

1331
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:31,760
uh they convert electrical energy into

1332
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:35,400
uh heat and vice

1333
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:39,600
versa H without moving parts so these

1334
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:43,639
are engines that do not have

1335
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,800
Machinery so these are uh very important

1336
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:48,360
features for some applications for

1337
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:51,040
example for space applications this is

1338
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:54,000
fundamental because uh once you have

1339
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:57,719
sent something in space uh and it's very

1340
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,920
hard to provide maintenance so moving

1341
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:03,679
parts are a problem and so if you

1342
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:06,800
have these kind of

1343
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,800
devices they

1344
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:14,600
are they're good plus also in space you

1345
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:18,280
have the availability of very large

1346
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,880
temperature differences because you

1347
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:25,840
have the photons coming from the Sun

1348
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:28,600
that we just said it's uh 56 uh 5760 k

1349
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:32,040
and on the other side you have the the

1350
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,159
dark space which is maybe what is it 2.7

1351
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,719
or

1352
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:38,400
4K so

1353
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:40,480
that through of course you need

1354
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,199
electromagnetic gradiation because those

1355
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,159
they don't have a heat

1356
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:49,840
exchanger the provider of those fluxes

1357
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:49,840
are the photons that we just talked

1358
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:59,840
about the problem with u the development

1359
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:02,800
of devices based on uh on these

1360
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:05,560
effects is the

1361
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:09,159
materials because standard materials

1362
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:11,400
have a very small very small values of

1363
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:14,159
the PTI or CC

1364
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:18,960
coefficients for example

1365
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,960
here I took the ones for

1366
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:26,199
copper copper has a cic coefficient of

1367
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,199
1.5

1368
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:35,800
microvolt microvolt per

1369
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,800
Kelvin against a very high conductivity

1370
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:42,280
K and so the Peltier coefficient which

1371
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:46,080
would mean would would would would would

1372
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:49,120
mean if in this case if I have 1

1373
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:56,280
mm cross-section of my

1374
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:59,920
wire and I run one ampere into it

1375
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:02,120
uh and suppose I have on the other side

1376
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,920
an ideal material that is

1377
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,679
zero so the difference is all only that

1378
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:09,719
of

1379
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:10,920
copper I would be able to generate Point

1380
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:14,440
half of a

1381
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:15,600
mwatt half a mwatt per ampere ampere is

1382
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:21,320
a lot of

1383
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,320
current mwatt is is pretty

1384
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,960
little uh

1385
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:38,159
yeah you can also uh read uh this

1386
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:42,120
equation

1387
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:47,120
here in another uh situation suppose you

1388
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:51,880
have a no current Noor no heat

1389
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:55,719
flux so no heat flux zero here so that

1390
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:59,480
says that if you run an electric current

1391
01:15:55,719 --> 01:16:02,639
through your wire with no heat flux you

1392
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,639
have a buildup of

1393
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:11,600
temperature this is uh we call it also

1394
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:16,880
Thompson effect

1395
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:19,040
uh but no no I think it's p okay but um

1396
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:23,120
so how much how much temperature

1397
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:25,639
gradient does it build up so again see

1398
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:28,040
if I take my millimeter wide and I put

1399
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:33,239
one ampere into

1400
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:37,639
it it does it builds up 1K

1401
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:37,639
1.2k over a meter of

1402
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:44,360
wire so these are small effects but

1403
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,480
people are developing

1404
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:50,080
materials for this purpose so there is

1405
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,560
an entire literature that you might me

1406
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:56,639
familiar if you're working on on the

1407
01:16:52,560 --> 01:17:00,000
field of uh

1408
01:16:56,639 --> 01:17:05,440
uh uh scientists working on

1409
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:10,760
developing uh nanomaterials or special

1410
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:14,840
materials designed to maximize these PTI

1411
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,840
and um CC

1412
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,719
coefficients some of these materials are

1413
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:26,320
also

1414
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,960
semiconductors so this is

1415
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:33,159
a typical

1416
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:37,040
setup and uh you put many of these

1417
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:40,679
devices in in in parallel so as to

1418
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:44,400
produce sensible amount of

1419
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:47,760
uh of power each one contributes a

1420
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:50,920
little but if you put a lot together uh

1421
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:54,040
overall you may obtain the effect that

1422
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,040
you need

1423
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:04,600
and the typical design of these devices

1424
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:07,159
is uh is the same whether you're using

1425
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:10,080
the uh

1426
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:14,320
Electro Thermo Electric

1427
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:16,320
generator or if you want your sort of

1428
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:20,400
solid state

1429
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:23,040
thermocouple or you want the

1430
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:25,840
ptsl so it's the same device that

1431
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:28,880
depending on how you use it

1432
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,280
performs in in different in this

1433
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,280
different

1434
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,960
ways now regarding the thermoelectric

1435
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:47,880
generator uh

1436
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:50,760
traditionally people like

1437
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:55,800
to characteriz the

1438
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:59,239
materials with this uh parameter here

1439
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:03,120
which is called Figure of Merit for the

1440
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:03,120
um thermoelectric

1441
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,880
material which is the uh Epsilon so CC

1442
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,600
Square time temperature divided by

1443
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:17,840
resistivity and thermal

1444
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:22,560
conductivity you may we may see how this

1445
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:24,760
parameter comes out in in in our own uh

1446
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:28,199
language or at least the language that

1447
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:34,000
we have developed in this uh course if

1448
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:37,520
you um accept that you can U uh rewrite

1449
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,960
the the work the power of the electric

1450
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,920
therm electric generator that we have

1451
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,920
developed in the previous

1452
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:48,239
slides as an

1453
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:51,520
integral of what happens locally so as

1454
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:55,360
if everywhere in the in the in the wire

1455
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:57,400
there is a a something that is

1456
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,320
the local contribution to the overall

1457
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:03,239
effect so you integrate that local

1458
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:05,080
contribution over the entire distance

1459
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:09,920
and you get the overall

1460
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:14,560
effect in a sense this is a power

1461
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:17,960
density electrical useful useful power

1462
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,440
density of your device okay so if you

1463
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:23,320
accept uh accept that and then in fact

1464
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:26,000
that power density is the

1465
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:30,920
product of the the electric

1466
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,840
current and the gradient in in in the

1467
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:36,280
electric in the Vol in the voltage so

1468
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:40,400
that's voltage times current is power no

1469
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:40,400
so this is the density

1470
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:46,560
though so I take this one and then I'm

1471
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,520
going to in order I want to Define an

1472
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,760
efficiency second low efficiency which

1473
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:53,639
is down

1474
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:57,400
here so I want to take the

1475
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:59,679
work obtained and divided by the maximum

1476
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:02,239
work I could obtain for that same

1477
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:04,560
temperature difference now locally the

1478
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:06,520
temperature difference is just the

1479
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,639
temperature gradient and if you go back

1480
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:13,000
in the notes and maybe this uh image

1481
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:15,560
reminds you where to go you you see

1482
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,719
remember that when we when we did this

1483
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:21,159
the elements of the heat transfer we we

1484
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:24,159
said yeah we could substitute our

1485
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:26,480
material with a a little engine and how

1486
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:29,560
much work would it be able to

1487
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,320
do if you go back you find that that

1488
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:35,280
maximum

1489
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:40,120
work uh or work rate is given by uh the

1490
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:43,800
heat times the the gradient in 1 / T *

1491
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:43,800
T so this is the

1492
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:49,239
expression

1493
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:52,560
therefore the second L

1494
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:55,199
efficiency of your thermoelectric

1495
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:58,440
generator locally at least local

1496
01:21:55,199 --> 01:22:00,880
contribution is given by the ratio

1497
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,360
between this and

1498
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,280
that which we can calculate because we

1499
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,520
have the equations for for the gradient

1500
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:11,080
in Fe for Q that's it's the same

1501
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:14,960
equations that we started

1502
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,960
with so do the

1503
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:23,440
substitutions and compute the the

1504
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:26,040
work now again here the work can take uh

1505
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:29,800
um

1506
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:32,400
can take a maximum Max maximum

1507
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,840
values uh I think there is an error here

1508
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,480
this must be a minus

1509
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:40,679
sign

1510
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,679
yeah yeah because there's a minus

1511
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,719
here

1512
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:53,080
yeah I don't see it right off hand but

1513
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:55,560
this I think this should be a

1514
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:58,080
minus because this is the jewel effect

1515
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:59,320
that should detract from the work that

1516
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,920
is

1517
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:05,480
done so you maximize this by taking the

1518
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:08,400
derivative with respect to to the

1519
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:10,520
current density and set it to zero

1520
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,460
substitute and you get the expression

1521
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,639
for the

1522
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:17,040
[Music]

1523
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:17,040
maximum power

1524
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:24,520
density and this is the maximum that you

1525
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,520
should get

1526
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:32,320
ah no okay I see they are different in

1527
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:35,960
sence because the gradient the gradient

1528
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:39,320
is negative because the work uh you get

1529
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:42,600
work when when the current goes down uh

1530
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:45,600
the negative you need a decreasing

1531
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:48,159
temperature gradient yeah okay in fact

1532
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,800
you get the maximum when I is minus

1533
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,800
gradient of

1534
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,679
it and

1535
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,520
so we take this substituting the

1536
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,480
expression for the

1537
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,840
Q and obtain therefore the maximum

1538
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:09,080
reversible

1539
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:11,280
work so at maximum power the ratio of

1540
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:14,639
this to

1541
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:18,080
that you see they both depend on the

1542
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:23,840
square of the gradient

1543
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:24,880
so they uh disappear this cancels with

1544
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,639
that

1545
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,560
and you're left with just a ratio of

1546
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:34,679
coefficients where this parameter of

1547
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,679
Merit appears this

1548
01:24:35,239 --> 01:24:46,639
Z okay so this is not the standard way

1549
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:46,639
of presenting uh this parameter of

1550
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,880
Merit but at least it has some value of

1551
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,239
being local the problem is that in

1552
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:59,239
practical applications since the

1553
01:24:56,239 --> 01:25:02,080
materialss that you use are temperature

1554
01:24:59,239 --> 01:25:04,360
dependent and uh and it is important

1555
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:07,000
that that they be temperature

1556
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:10,760
dependent um

1557
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
often in these kind of derivations of of

1558
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:15,199
this parameter you assume constant C

1559
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,239
coefficient or constant

1560
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:21,360
thermoconductivity or constant which is

1561
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:24,760
uh which is only for the purpose of the

1562
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:26,679
derivation and not uh

1563
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,679
in order to arrive to this

1564
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:29,679
expression

1565
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:40,719
okay again in the the list of

1566
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,719
thermoelectric effects we can

1567
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:50,560
also list this Thompson effect which is

1568
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:56,119
though um I think still the same thing

1569
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,119
only said in a different uh language

1570
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:04,639
so we have seen that in the interplay

1571
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:08,040
between electric current and temperature

1572
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:10,840
gradient uh allows you to

1573
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:15,760
transform uh electrical

1574
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:15,760
energy into thermal energy and vice

1575
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:26,960
versa so what we do here is to take uh

1576
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,960
to write the balance equation for the

1577
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:32,960
internal energy and you can do this for

1578
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:36,199
a for a for also for a flow situation we

1579
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:39,600
have written if you go back where couple

1580
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:42,199
of lectures ago when we did the general

1581
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:46,679
balance equations we have we had an

1582
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:46,679
expression for the balance for

1583
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:54,440
energy and uh today in one of the

1584
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:56,199
previous uh slides we've done uh the

1585
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,360
difference

1586
01:26:56,199 --> 01:27:04,000
between the energy and the internal

1587
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:05,560
energy which is all those terms kinetic

1588
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,639
potential and so

1589
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:10,639
on so in order to obtain a balance

1590
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,560
equation for the just internal energy

1591
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,520
you have to subtract from the energy

1592
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:18,040
balance

1593
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:20,800
equation uh uh the balance equation for

1594
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:22,600
the non-thermal aspects so for the

1595
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:26,119
mechanical aspects like the kinetic the

1596
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,119
potential and the

1597
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:36,320
electrical and if you do that uh this is

1598
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:39,880
what uh what using the slide that

1599
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,880
mentioned you can obtain

1600
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:46,199
this of course in the uh in the balance

1601
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:49,480
for energy there appears

1602
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:53,000
the energy flux that's the

1603
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:54,960
overall uh diffusive energy flux which

1604
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,400
we have broken into

1605
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:02,840
a nonwork and a work part the nonwork

1606
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:06,560
part part is the one that now if for a

1607
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:09,639
solid in the absence therefore of other

1608
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:13,199
moving particles other than the just the

1609
01:28:09,639 --> 01:28:15,880
electrons in the in the in the conductor

1610
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:17,280
is just given by these two terms

1611
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:19,560
otherwise you would have the summation

1612
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:23,800
of the enthalpies partial

1613
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:27,960
enthalpies and for the work part it's

1614
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:31,119
given by the um stress tensor times the

1615
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:33,560
velocity but if we are assuming that

1616
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:36,159
there's no velocity here this is really

1617
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,159
going

1618
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:45,040
away so uh if you get to the

1619
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,719
end

1620
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,920
U the terms that

1621
01:28:47,719 --> 01:28:52,560
survive are this so uh on the left hand

1622
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,280
side of the balance equation you have

1623
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,639
the material derivative of the internal

1624
01:28:54,280 --> 01:29:00,840
energy of your uh fluid element so

1625
01:28:57,639 --> 01:29:03,520
that's the internal energy that part of

1626
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,320
the energy as of the fu elements as you

1627
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:08,719
follow its

1628
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:12,440
motion that gets

1629
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,440
changed by what

1630
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,560
by

1631
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:21,360
uh heat

1632
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:24,360
diffusion this is for for thermal

1633
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,360
diffusion

1634
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,400
so you should think of this as

1635
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:38,280
the uh the equivalent of of the forier

1636
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:42,360
law forier equation of of cond

1637
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:48,119
conduction so this is would be row CV

1638
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:51,960
times the DT DT D temperature of DT this

1639
01:29:48,119 --> 01:29:57,080
is K Times app of the temperature if if

1640
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:59,480
K is independent dep of position

1641
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:02,080
therefore of

1642
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:04,400
temperature then you have this term here

1643
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:07,840
this term here is the jewel effect this

1644
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:10,239
is like a source term it's would be in

1645
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:14,199
in heat transfer you would put it as a q

1646
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:17,639
triple prime so it's a a source ter of

1647
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:17,639
of thermal

1648
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:25,440
energy and it

1649
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:27,560
actually it's uh electrical energy that

1650
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:30,000
gets dissipated into thermal energy via

1651
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,000
the jewel

1652
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:38,040
effect if you had written uh the balance

1653
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:41,320
equation for the mechanical and

1654
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:43,520
electrical parts this same term would

1655
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:46,840
appear there with a negative sign so it

1656
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,800
would detract it would destroy uh

1657
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,920
mechanical and electrical energy so it

1658
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:53,480
would be negative sign in those

1659
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:56,320
equations and appears here with positive

1660
01:30:53,480 --> 01:31:01,280
sign because because it goes from

1661
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:04,239
electrical to uh to Thermal and it's one

1662
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:06,280
way it has a definite sign that cannot

1663
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:09,440
be negative it goes only in that way you

1664
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:11,880
can only kill uh electrical energy with

1665
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,880
the jewel

1666
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:18,000
effect

1667
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:20,080
like uh although we in a solid this

1668
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,159
doesn't really make sense but I just put

1669
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:24,719
it for for our discussion if you also

1670
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:27,119
had flow

1671
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:31,440
the the viscous dissipation also has the

1672
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:33,679
same feature it appears with a negative

1673
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:36,920
sign in the equation for the kinetic

1674
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:40,960
energy kinetic plus potential energy

1675
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:44,360
because it kills that kind of energy and

1676
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,520
it appears with a positive sign in the

1677
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:48,880
internal

1678
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,239
energy so that transforms so this is

1679
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,840
always

1680
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:56,639
positive but then there is also this

1681
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:58,760
term this term is is the jewel the the

1682
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:02,440
Thompson

1683
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:04,480
effect uh it's it's you see there is a

1684
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:06,280
scalar product of the electric current

1685
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,480
and the gradient in

1686
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:13,400
temperature this can

1687
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,400
be all signs could be positive and

1688
01:32:13,719 --> 01:32:19,159
negative and

1689
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:21,840
uh and it allows you and it is it is

1690
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:25,520
that term which allows the effects that

1691
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:30,760
we explained in in transform in uh

1692
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:32,600
thermal energy into um electrical energy

1693
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:36,480
if it is

1694
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:39,520
negative because with a minor sign uh

1695
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:42,960
I'm sorry since it is a minor sign if it

1696
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:45,360
is POS if it is positive it consumes

1697
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:49,440
internal energy and where does that

1698
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:49,440
energy go it becomes

1699
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:59,040
electrical or vice versa you use uh

1700
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:02,320
electrical energy in order if for this

1701
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:08,040
becoming thermal energy

1702
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:08,040
okay so this adds a a

1703
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:22,360
term the Thompson

1704
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,360
coefficient

1705
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:28,800
is if you follow the various steps at a

1706
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:33,239
certain stage uh we have uh since there

1707
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:36,280
is the the Divergence of of the energy

1708
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:38,080
flux it brings in the gradient of the

1709
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:40,960
ptia coefficient and the gradient of the

1710
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:43,480
pelti coefficient can can be written as

1711
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:46,600
the partial as how it varies with

1712
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:49,520
temperature partial of of pi over T

1713
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,520
times the gradient in

1714
01:33:52,119 --> 01:33:59,159
temperature and this uh Thompson

1715
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,159
coefficient sometimes it's called with T

1716
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:05,119
I use this

1717
01:34:01,159 --> 01:34:07,760
Epsilon T looking Greek symbol just not

1718
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:11,400
confusing we have so many T's here that

1719
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:15,199
one more would be too many so uh this is

1720
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:18,119
given by U the difference

1721
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:20,239
between the how the P coefficient varies

1722
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:22,520
with temperature and the CC coefficient

1723
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:26,360
but since Peltier and CC are

1724
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:29,199
connected uh the the Onaga relation p is

1725
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:33,040
Epsilon times T you can also write this

1726
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:35,280
coefficient as T times how the C varies

1727
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,280
with

1728
01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:41,880
temperature and uh recently there have

1729
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:44,960
there have been

1730
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:48,639
people discussing the fact

1731
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:52,480
that there may be it may be more um or

1732
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:54,760
at least maybe um a good idea to try to

1733
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,960
build uh

1734
01:34:54,760 --> 01:35:00,040
Thermo Electric

1735
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:03,440
Generators not so much on the

1736
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:04,560
basis of that parameter there but on the

1737
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:07,920
basis

1738
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:11,480
of materials that have a very high

1739
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:15,719
temperature dependence of the CC

1740
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:19,320
coefficient so as to

1741
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:21,960
enhance this gamma and therefore enhance

1742
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:27,520
the capability for a given gr gradient

1743
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:27,520
temperature to produce uh the highest Uh

1744
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:34,920
current okay let me just mention uh

1745
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:37,840
before yeah we have a couple of

1746
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:43,320
minutes I'm not going into the details

1747
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:47,000
here just want to mention that uh the

1748
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:53,280
range so the the inventory the the

1749
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:55,800
catalog of uh effects that we have

1750
01:35:53,280 --> 01:36:00,639
covered with that Matrix that we started

1751
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:02,280
on today with the K principle uh is not

1752
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:05,159
at all

1753
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:08,840
complete uh

1754
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:12,159
because for example if you add uh one

1755
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,159
item the the magnetic

1756
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:20,320
field you you add

1757
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:25,560
another uh spot in that

1758
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:25,560
Matrix and actually another for for

1759
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:32,280
spots uh and these are uh effects that

1760
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:34,600
belong to the same

1761
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:36,719
category one is called and they also

1762
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:39,840
belong to the history no like one is

1763
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:44,239
called the all

1764
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,239
effect uh H is the magnetic

1765
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:50,840
field uh and the other is called and the

1766
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:56,159
converse or let's say the Onaga re

1767
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:58,480
reciprocal effect is called ner n

1768
01:36:56,159 --> 01:37:02,280
effect

1769
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:04,239
and they generate they they gener if you

1770
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:07,080
have an electric field and you have an

1771
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:09,040
electric current in One Direction the

1772
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:10,840
magnetic field produces an electric

1773
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,800
current also in the opp in the

1774
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:16,719
orthogonal direction this is the whole

1775
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:18,480
effect and N does the same thing instead

1776
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,639
of having this driving force the

1777
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:23,880
electric field you have this driving

1778
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:27,520
force the gradient in temperature which

1779
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:29,760
uh we know that uh drives an electric

1780
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:31,480
current like we just seen the

1781
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,400
thermoelectric effect but in the

1782
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:35,960
presence of magnetic field it also

1783
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:38,320
drives an orthogonal current like the

1784
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,320
all

1785
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:45,199
effect and very recently as you see this

1786
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:48,400
is just a few years ago

1787
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:52,080
people uh have been working on the

1788
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:55,440
equivalent of these effects also on uh

1789
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:55,440
spin uh

1790
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:02,840
currents so they're not moving charges

1791
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:06,760
but they are moving the spin that is uh

1792
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:11,679
internal into like uh the atoms or the

1793
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:14,320
nuclei of the uh atoms that you move

1794
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:15,760
around so and you look just at the

1795
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:20,000
current of

1796
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:20,000
Spin and they have found similar

1797
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:25,960
effects and this is I guess it's see

1798
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:30,840
similar uh

1799
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:33,840
idea done with spin currents instead of

1800
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,840
charge

1801
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:40,920
currents and so this was only to say

1802
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:44,000
that this is a a topic

1803
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:47,920
that is so Broad

1804
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,880
and and so full of applications that

1805
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,199
it's very difficult to to cover in a in

1806
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,440
a sort of a

1807
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:55,440
systematic uh

1808
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:05,400
way but it's also to show that

1809
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:08,880
um it can be it it must be uh

1810
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:12,080
regularized and understood in a in a

1811
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:15,719
systematic framework like we have done

1812
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:19,639
uh uh starting with the entropic point

1813
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:22,040
of view and uh uh developing the linear

1814
01:39:19,639 --> 01:39:23,679
Force flux relations and applying on sag

1815
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,920
relations

1816
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,880
and

1817
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:31,520
often uh

1818
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:35,400
this way of proceeding uh is is what

1819
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:39,119
drives the the the search for new

1820
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:42,280
effects you didn't think about it until

1821
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:45,239
you said all I see ah

1822
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:47,199
so so by induction there must be an

1823
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:51,159
effect like that because there is a spot

1824
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:55,800
in that Matrix of a phenomena that is

1825
01:39:51,159 --> 01:40:00,000
that is related via the onager

1826
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:04,480
principle all right so yes I think we

1827
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,440
are done for today and U next time we do

1828
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:10,119
the

1829
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:12,119
thermal diffusive effects and and then

1830
01:40:10,119 --> 01:40:15,679
we will be done so next uh lecture will

1831
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:15,679
be the last one
