00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,080
Hi, I'm Dr. Praep Narajin and I'm the

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,920
director of preventive cardiology and

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,000
genetics researcher at Massachusetts

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,880
General Hospital and the Broad Institute

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,880
of MIT and Harvard.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
South Asians have a substantially higher

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,320
risk of atheroscllerotic cardiovascular

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
disease compared with most other

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,800
ethnicities. Atherosclerosis is the

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,679
underlying plaque buildup that leads to

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
heart attacks. US practice guidelines

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,399
now recognize South Asian ancestry as a

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
risk-enhancing factor. That's because

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,879
available clinical risk estimators that

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,200
doctors use underpredict cardiovascular

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
disease risk in South Asian populations.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,640
The risk tools currently used were

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,399
developed using cohorts with a minimal

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
number of individuals of South Asian

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,280
ancestry. And because risk is higher in

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,840
South Asian individuals, having a

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,079
populationspecific tool to identify risk

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
is important for disease prevention.

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
Given this and the increased

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
cardiovascular disease in South Asians,

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,519
we developed the our health polygenic

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,080
risk in South Asian study, also known as

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,080
our health PRS.

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,119
Hi, I'm Dr. Aner Patel and I'm a

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,040
cardiologist and researcher at

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,960
Massachusetts General Hospital focusing

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,960
on multimodal cardiovascular risk

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,960
prediction.

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,640
Your DNA contains instructions that

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,880
guide how your body works and grows.

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,479
While most of our DNA is the same, we

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,400
each have small differences that make us

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,320
unique. Some of these differences can

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
slightly raise or lower your chance of

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
developing certain health conditions

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
like heart disease. Apologetic score is

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,439
a single number that adds up the effects

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,960
of thousands of these small DNA

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,400
differences. It gives us a way to

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,560
estimate your genetic risk for a

46
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,560
condition like coronary artery disease.

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
For South Asians, the risk of heart

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,320
disease is higher, even in people who

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,000
are young or otherwise healthy. Knowing

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,079
your genetic risk can help you take

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,320
action early before problems start. To

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,560
calculate a polygenic score, scientists

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,719
look at many genetic variants. Each one

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
may increase or decrease your risk just

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,479
a little, but together they create a

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
bigger picture of your inherited risk.

57
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,319
Your polygenic score tells you how your

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,399
genetic risk compares to others, but it

59
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,000
doesn't predict the future. It can't say

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,760
for sure whether you will or you won't

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
get heart disease. Many other things

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,599
like your diet, exercise, smoking

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
habits, and blood pressure also play a

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,879
big role. If your genetic risk is high,

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
there are proven steps you can take to

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,319
lower your overall risk, and your doctor

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
can help you decide what's right for

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,760
you. The RH Health PRS looks at your

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,920
genetic risk for coronary artery

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,440
disease. In the future, it may also

71
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,440
include risk scores for other related

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
conditions.

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,040
Hi, I'm Dr. Kavia Parachuri and I'm the

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,319
clinical operations director for

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
cardiovascular medicine at the

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,680
Massachusetts General Hospital where I'm

77
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,519
also a preventive cardiologist and

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
researcher. When a patient walks into

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
clinic, we want to offer them care

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
that's both predictive and personalized.

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
That's where polygenic risk scores come

82
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,120
into play. Polygenic risk scores can be

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,959
a powerful addition in the clinic. They

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
help us identify patients who may still

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,560
be at increased risk for heart disease,

86
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,480
even if their traditional risk markers

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,800
like cholesterol or blood pressure look

88
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
fine. With this insight, we can guide

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,319
prevention more effectively. From

90
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,840
starting medications sooner to boosting

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
lifestyle interventions or scheduling

92
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
screenings more often. The beauty of PRS

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,760
is that it bridges research and clinical

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
care. It empowers our patients

95
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
information and it gives us as

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
clinicians a sharper lens to catch heart

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,800
disease before it happens, especially in

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,120
communities that have historically been

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
under represented in routine guidelines.

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
It is important to clarify though that

101
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,040
polygenic risk report returned in the

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,799
RHL participants is a research finding,

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,280
not a clinically validated result or

104
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,879
diagnosis. Participants are advised to

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
consult with their healthcare providers

106
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,159
to discuss questions and implications

107
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,200
before making any clinical care

108
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
decisions.
