1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,880
all right welcome back to 61200 today we

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,039
are talking about number Theory uh and

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,760
number is I guess an old word here for

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:27,039
integers in modern terminology um you

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,720
know this Set uh Blackboard bold Z which

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,759
is all positive and negative integers

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,440
although mostly we think about natural

8
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,920
numbers the non- negative integers uh

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
number theory is a a big topic we're

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,039
going to spend three lectures on it

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,800
today and to next week um and it's a

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,640
really important branch of sub Branch I

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,600
guess or related branch of discrete

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,640
mathematics uh in particular because

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,840
it's found a lot of applications in

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,039
modern days in cryptography and error

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,600
correction every when you use your cell

18
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,840
phone probably several different things

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,719
uh in your in that software is using

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,199
number Theory at some level to do crypto

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,040
to access your bank to do uh error

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,200
correction to talk over radio waves all

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,840
sorts of fun things uh number three is

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,920
also extremely old it's probably the

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
oldest branch of mathematics though you

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,479
know past 4,000 years it's a little hard

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,439
to tell exactly what people were doing

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,479
uh but in particular the Babylonians uh

29
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:25,079
3,800 years ago were uh doing number

30
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,680
Theory uh Pythagoras uh 25 200 years ago

31
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,600
was doing number Theory um in the it had

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,240
a a lot of exciting activity in the

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,200
middle of last century uh Hardy is one

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,079
of the famous uh number theories number

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,759
theorists of sort of near our time um he

36
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,960
wrote uh number theory is great because

37
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,680
it's one science whose very remoteness

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,159
very remoteness from human activities

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,799
should keep it gentle and clean he was a

40
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,200
pacifist and he wanted to do math that

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,680
was completely useless from the

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,560
perspective of warfare sadly uh that's

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,479
not the case for number Theory anymore

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,439
but it used to be um

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,360
so uh but the things we'll be doing here

46
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,600
are pretty fundamental uh today we're

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,119
going to talk about divisibility and

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,119
something called gcd which you may have

49
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,080
heard of before it's a pretty basic

50
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,760
notion both of these are but we're going

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,040
to Define everything carefully and prove

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
uh all sorts of cool properties about

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,000
divisibility and use it to solve at

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,480
least one fun

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,560
problem so uh the notation for

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,200
divisibility is a divides

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,200
B uh we use a vertical bar we use a

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,720
vertical Bar for a few other things like

59
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,159
absolute value and set notation so try

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,400
not to be too confused uh this will only

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:47,599
be for uh a couple weeks um divisibility

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,760
means uh a evenly divides b or B is

63
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,319
evenly divisible by a okay so for

64
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,720
example

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,720
uh let's say uh two divides 4 as an

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,720
example

67
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,159
uh but in general what we would like is

68
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,680
a a def a formal definition of

69
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:14,720
this um so we'll say a divides B if

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,720
there exists some integer

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:24,200
multiple

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:28,760
K such that uh B is that multiple of a

73
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,920
so b equal K * a very important that

74
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,480
this is an integer otherwise over reals

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,040
this is always the case pretty

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,120
much um and we Define divisibility in

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,239
terms of multiplication instead of

78
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,879
division I mean you could divide both

79
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,439
sides by uh a here and so for example

80
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,920
this is saying B divided by a is an

81
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,280
integer but that's not such a great

82
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,879
definition because it doesn't work well

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,000
when you try to divide by zero this

84
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,799
definition works even when B is when a

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,040
is zero and uh otherwi if you do

86
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
division it doesn't so that's why we

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,760
Define divisibility this way so more

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,840
interesting examples are 2 ID n uh means

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,239
what we have been saying n is

90
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,720
even whenever we say n is even what we

91
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,880
really mean is two divides n there's

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:23,880
some integer multiple of two that equals

93
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:26,440
n okay uh some other weirder

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,880
cases every natural

95
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,479
number uh n divides n

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,160
it's maybe not so intuitive what

97
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,720
divisibility means for negative numbers

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
but here are some examples we allow this

99
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,639
integer multiple K to be negative so in

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,479
particular K can be minus1 and minus1 *

101
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,080
negative n is n okay also n divides n

102
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,199
but that's a little less exciting uh

103
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,000
another fun fact is that every number

104
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,880
divides

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,960
zero this is also maybe not the most

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,840
intuitive but it comes from the

107
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,840
definition K in particular can be zero

108
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,919
and if you take 0 * n you get zero so

109
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,680
everything divides zero uh number also

110
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,400
divides its negative things like that um

111
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,080
a consequence of these two things

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,440
together is that zero is even if you

113
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,160
were ever worried about whether zero was

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,360
an exception to evenness in the

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,560
alternation of of these numbers yes uh

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,360
this is even this is even this is even

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,680
because uh in particular 2 divides 0

118
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,000
everything divides Z but in particular

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,240
two divid Z that's the meaning of

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
even okay great uh

121
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,880
let's State some theorems about

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,960
divisibility I'm going to call these

123
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,639
divisibility facts we're going to use

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,000
them several times

125
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:58,080
today uh let's say we have

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,080
two numbers divisible by the same thing

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,560
uh we call this uh D is a

128
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,560
common

129
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,919
divisor of A and B so D divides A and D

130
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,000
divides B we call it a common

131
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,520
divisor uh

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,560
then I claim uh for example D divides a

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,120
plus b their

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,160
sum why this is very easy to prove if

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:42,039
you just work through the definition so

136
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:43,639
let's say um a = j * D and Bal K * D for

137
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,280
some integers J and K they might be the

138
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,240
same they might be different uh then a

139
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,280
plus b well it's it's just the sum of

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:58,240
these two things right it's j + K *

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,759
D not very hard uh more generally uh D

142
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,240
divides

143
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,240
uh sa a + TB for any integers s and

144
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,440
t uh this is just a a simple extension

145
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:22,680
of this property um I guess you can

146
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:25,520
write uh this thing equals uh SJ + TK *

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,080
D um and it turns out this

148
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,440
structure is interesting it's what we

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,599
call an integer linear

150
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,759
combination this is a concept we will

151
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,759
also be using throughout

152
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,840
today so much so that uh I'm going to

153
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,759
give an acronym I don't usually like

154
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,360
acronyms but this is so long that it's

155
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,520
going to save me a ton of work to write

156
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,120
ilc for integer linear combination uh if

157
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,840
you know linear algebra this is just

158
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,159
linear combination but where the

159
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,520
coefficients need to be integers so it's

160
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:04,639
exactly this notion so an integer linear

161
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:08,759
combination of A and B uh is some number

162
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:12,879
s * a plus T * B uh for

163
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,400
any uh s and t that are integers okay so

164
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,560
if I give you two numbers A and B we'll

165
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,240
only be doing integer linear

166
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,440
combinations today of two

167
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,000
numbers uh then this is what they always

168
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,520
look like and given two numbers there's

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,639
some numbers you can construct VI

170
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,039
integer linear combinations and some you

171
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,759
can't uh actually fun fact divis

172
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,279
is like integer linear combinations of

173
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,159
one number this is saying B is an

174
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,399
integer linear combination of just a uh

175
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,760
but we that's so special we call it

176
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,279
divisibility U two numbers is where

177
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,279
integer linear combinations really get

178
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:51,279
interesting all right so to motivate

179
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:55,480
these Concepts more turns out these are

180
00:08:51,279 --> 00:09:00,079
key Concepts to solving a famous puzzle

181
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,399
uh it's at least 80 90 years old called

182
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:07,000
the water uh water pouring puzzle but it

183
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,240
became particularly famous uh through

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,240
Die Hard three Die Hard with a Vengeance

185
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,160
so we're going to watch a little clip uh

186
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,560
and if you uh if this clip is not

187
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,240
included in this video you can go uh

188
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,399
stream or uh purchase Die Hard with a

189
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,480
Vengeance and start at the one hour mark

190
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,640
and you will see an exchange like the

191
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,519
following so we have uh of course John

192
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,839
mlan here uh who's uh trying to save

193
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,680
Manhattan uh along with his friend Zeus

194
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,279
who's like an electrician who just

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,360
happens to get uh brought into this

196
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,839
whole chaos basically the bad guys are

197
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,920
trying to distract the good guys by

198
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,399
solving forcing them to solve puzzles so

199
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,519
here we go all right so we're going to

200
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,760
focus on the problem at hand uh which uh

201
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,760
we can formalize as

202
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,959
follows uh so we have two

203
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,959
jugs uh we'll say of

204
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,680
capacity A and B and we'll assume

205
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,040
they're integers and in the

206
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:16,120
example uh that saves Manhattan we have

207
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:20,240
a equals 5 and b equals 3 and we'd like

208
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:24,519
to represent some number uh in this case

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,680
four by a sequence of pouring

210
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,920
operations uh so um how could we

211
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,760
represent this water porn in problem

212
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,920
using techniques that we have from

213
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,120
previous

214
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,120
lectures any

215
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,720
ideas I heard

216
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,760
something yeah State machines good so

217
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,839
we'll use a state machine um and so

218
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,560
we'll have a

219
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:57,639
state x and y means that there's

220
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:02,320
currently X gallons in the first jug and

221
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:07,880
Y gallons in the second jck

222
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,880
uh or let's say the uh

223
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,600
amounts in uh

224
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
each

225
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:24,519
joke okay so uh we

226
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,800
start at the state z z let's say the

227
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,880
drug started empty uh we're given an

228
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,040
infinite water supply because they're at

229
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,000
a fountain

230
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,000
conveniently um

231
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,200
and let's see we want to finish at a

232
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,200
state that has four in one of the two

233
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,800
values and as John mlan said uh it has

234
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,360
to be in the bigger one in this case

235
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,519
because four is bigger than

236
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:53,519
three so we'd like

237
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:55,519
to uh goal is to get to uh four comma

238
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,639
something and the tricky part is to

239
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,440
write down the transitions here so let's

240
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,440
write down some of the

241
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
transitions

242
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,440
transitions so given X and

243
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,600
Y uh what are the some of the things I

244
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
could

245
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,639
do any

246
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,279
suggestions I have some partially filled

247
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,160
jars these are two jars of uh five and

248
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,920
three pumpkins capacity respectively uh

249
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,839
maybe I'm at some position here what

250
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,839
could I do to these trugs yeah the back

251
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,320
fill one to the top I I go to the

252
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,760
Fountain I pour it up until it's

253
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,279
completely fill or or this one I could

254
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,120
go to the fill Point other suggestions

255
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:46,040
yeah empty I could empty one of the jars

256
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,160
hopefully I won't need that so in the

257
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:52,000
transitions this is this corresponds to

258
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,440
going to uh I guess a comma y if I fill

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,279
the first one um or I could go to x

260
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,399
comma B if I fill the second one um I

261
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:05,760
could empty by going to uh 0 comma y if

262
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:09,639
I empty the first one or I could go to x

263
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,440
comma 0 so these are all sorry this is

264
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:17,360
all transitions from

265
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,360
XY uh anything else

266
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,839
yeah I can pour the contents of one jug

267
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,519
into the other cool yeah so here for

268
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,639
example I filled up a three I poured in

269
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,920
three uh I could fill this one up again

270
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,040
and pour it in again and at some point

271
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,920
uh I'll run out of capacity in this jug

272
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,120
and that's an event that I can detect

273
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,399
when I reach level Che okay so to write

274
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,680
that down more carefully given

275
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:52,920
XY we can transition to one of two cases

276
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,000
either we get to completely empty the

277
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,720
left jug into the right jug so this

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,839
would be uh x + y but that's only

279
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,399
possible

280
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,199
if it fits in the second jug If X Plus Y

281
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:10,000
is less than or equal to B otherwise to

282
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:14,519
do arithmetic this too hard uh we move

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,320
over B minus y or something um so we

284
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:22,880
have x minus B minus y comma B

285
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,440
otherwise okay if we end up filling up

286
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,120
the second one then this is how much uh

287
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,800
of the original X that I started with

288
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,839
remains

289
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,639
okay uh and you can do the there's one

290
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,800
more rule which is if I pour from right

291
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,440
to left those are the available uh State

292
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,000
transitions in this puzzle uh and now

293
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,560
maybe I've talked about it long enough

294
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you have some intuition on how to solve

295
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,000
this start

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,680
empty any suggestions on how to

297
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,680
construct the number

298
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,519
four yeah

299
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,720
let fill up the five gallon

300
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
jug

301
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,600
okay okay we're going to transfer the

302
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,240
three gallon jug until the three gallon

303
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,399
jug is exactly empty which if you're

304
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,440
using water it would be

305
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,440
level okay empty the three gallon

306
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,680
jug okay move the two over this now

307
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,240
feels like towers of anoi

308
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,160
okay fill the five

309
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,800
and then transfer like

310
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,319
this from five to did I get the right

311
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,000
number there we go water's water's

312
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,880
particularly unsettled today all right

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,440
so we've got uh five on the right if I

314
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,560
can count and we fill over here until

315
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
this one is filled and now we've got the

316
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,639
number four

317
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,800
yay uh that's how we solve that's how we

318
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,440
save Manhattan with uh with this water

319
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,519
pouring problem but uh while the bad

320
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,639
guys are off uh stealing

321
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,920
money from the bank um but sometimes

322
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,820
this puzzle isn't solvable so let's take

323
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,880
another

324
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:14,360
[Applause]

325
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:19,480
example uh let's say we want uh AAL 6

326
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,880
bals 4 and we want the number

327
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,440
three is this possible I already gave

328
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,519
away that this is impossible why is it

329
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,720
impossible any

330
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,800
feelings hint it has something to do

331
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,800
with this

332
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
stuff

333
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,360
yeah okay you said there are no integer

334
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,360
linear combinations where of six and

335
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,680
four that make three that is true but uh

336
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,959
this problem isn't directly about

337
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,120
integer linear combinations is it I

338
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,120
don't

339
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,319
know

340
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,000
yeah there's no way to get an odd number

341
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,720
from these two

342
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,319
gallons that's the simp both of you are

343
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,039
correct uh the simpler reason in this

344
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,520
case

345
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,520
uh is it's impossible to get an odd

346
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,360
amount um I guess the proof of both of

347
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,400
these things is you look at all the

348
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,439
possible Transitions and uh You observe

349
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,880
that if you start with A and B being

350
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,039
even you can never construct an odd

351
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,840
number by adding and subtracting all

352
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,720
we're doing here taking numbers that

353
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,559
we've constructed adding them and or

354
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,679
subtracting them with a and b or each

355
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,360
other and so if you start with even

356
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,559
numbers you add and subtract them you

357
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,280
always stay within the even numbers but

358
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,799
also as you're saying if you start with

359
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,240
an integer linear combination of A and B

360
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:50,080
all you can get are integer linear

361
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,240
combinations of A and B so here is uh a

362
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,559
key Lemma about this puzzle and why that

363
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:01,240
is impossible more

364
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:01,240
generally is uh all reachable

365
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,400
amounts in this puzzle are integer

366
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,200
linear

367
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,799
combinations of A and

368
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,799
B let's prove

369
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,919
this any suggestions on how to prove a

370
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,919
property like

371
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,120
this you remember all the way back to

372
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,240
State machines hopefully you've been

373
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
studying for the test State machines are

374
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,600
on the test this lecture is not it will

375
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
be on quiz

376
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:40,600
two invariance yeah in particular

377
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,720
uh this this is a statement about

378
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,520
invariance this is saying uh for all

379
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,520
reachable uh X comma

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,280
y um X and Y are integer linear

381
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,320
combinations of A and B so this is an

382
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,840
invariant property this is a state

383
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,440
predicate we want to prove that it's

384
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,240
invariant that is true for all reachable

385
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,760
states starting from 0 0 um and we

386
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,760
usually do that using the invariant

387
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,679
principle which has requires two steps

388
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,320
one is base case we need to check that

389
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,280
this predicate holds

390
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,039
initially uh and the initial state for

391
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,840
us is 0 comma 0 and we observe that zero

392
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:32,840
is indeed a linear combination of A and

393
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:35,760
B namely 0 * a uh plus 0 * B great base

394
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,159
case is true and so now we just need the

395
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,960
inductive step or the I guess the

396
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,159
preserved the fact that this predicate

397
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,159
is

398
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,640
preserved uh so suppose that we're at

399
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:55,919
some State X and Y where the predicate

400
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:59,520
is true uh so xal sa a + TB and y = s

401
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,799
prime a + T Prime B

402
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,880
um and then we just look at all of the

403
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,880
available

404
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,080
Transitions and we show that every

405
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:13,600
number that you can make uh is indeed an

406
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,400
integer linear combination of uh A and B

407
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:23,720
so let's do one example we can construct

408
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:29,760
X + Y X + Y uh we can rewrite as um s +

409
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:32,520
S Prime * a and t + T Prime * B so

410
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,039
that's uh if this transition happens to

411
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,840
be possible it may not be possible

412
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,120
because there's this if condition but if

413
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,799
we show that every thing every number we

414
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,000
could possibly build has this property

415
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:44,240
then of course all the ones that we can

416
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,480
actually reach also have this property

417
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,039
uh so X+ Y is indeed an integer linear

418
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:56,400
combination of a uh A and

419
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:58,640
B um Etc and of proof okay I don't want

420
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,960
to prove it for for every single

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
transition here uh just because there's

422
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,000
a bunch of them but for example a is

423
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,120
indeed an integer linear combination of

424
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,880
A and B it's 1 * a plus 0 * B this one

425
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,039
looks mess here it's actually just X+ y

426
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,279
minus B so it's almost the same you just

427
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,279
add a minus one here but the general

428
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,240
property we're using here is that all of

429
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,480
the constructible numbers here are

430
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,080
integer linear combinations of X Y A and

431
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,720
B Okay I lied we're using integer linear

432
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,840
combinations of four things but all of

433
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,279
the X and y's are also integer linear

434
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,960
combinations of a and B so what we're

435
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,120
really taking is integer linear

436
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,440
combinations of integer linear

437
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,320
combinations of A and B and it turns out

438
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,400
that if you take two integer linear

439
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,200
combinations of A and B like X and Y and

440
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,840
you add them together or in general take

441
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
an integer linear combination of them

442
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,840
you still get an integer linear

443
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,080
combination of A and B as you can see

444
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,720
from this proof it's actually pretty

445
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,960
much the same proof we were doing over

446
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,559
here uh this was integer linear

447
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,159
combinations of one number D and

448
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,159
divisibility was preserved even when you

449
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,600
took inte linear combinations so same

450
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,440
idea and for any puzzle where you have

451
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,720
that property you can only construct

452
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,440
numbers that are integer linear

453
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,039
combinations of A and B now for this

454
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,880
puzzle you can actually construct all of

455
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,120
them that fit in the

456
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,200
jars uh

457
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,559
so I'll just mention this as a claim and

458
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,039
if we have time at the end we'll come

459
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,000
back to

460
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,919
it uh we

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,120
can we can

462
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:33,600
obtain uh a value

463
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,600
X um if and only

464
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
if

465
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,840
uh let's say x is an integer linear

466
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,720
combination of A and

467
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,600
B

468
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,200
and

469
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,640
uh Z is less than equal to X is less

470
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,640
than equal to Max

471
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,799
of okay so we might try to um prove that

472
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,360
later

473
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:05,799
uh so now the central question is how do

474
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,679
we know whether one number is an integer

475
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,640
linear combination of two other numbers

476
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,840
and when it is can we actually construct

477
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,720
the values s and t so that sa a plus TB

478
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,960
equals x because that's what we needed

479
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,039
to solve this puzzle was some way to uh

480
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,320
we were only given the capacities of the

481
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,559
jars and the target value and now we

482
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,200
want to represent oh let's check that

483
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,080
this is actually possible for this

484
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,080
example

485
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,080
example

486
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,520
uh so if we um sorry not this example

487
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:45,679
the one that's actually solvable so for

488
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:50,440
this solvable puzzle uh 4 equals 2 * 5

489
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:53,960
that's 10 minus 2 * 3 that's

490
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,600
six right 10 - 6 is four so that's

491
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,600
intuitively why this puzzle is solvable

492
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,520
although that's not a proof I mean we

493
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,559
just saw that it wasn't limited by this

494
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,200
same issue uh so for example if we

495
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:07,760
started with six and

496
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,320
four We Know by this Lemma because two

497
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,840
divides four and two divides six two

498
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,600
will divide any integer linear

499
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,840
combination and therefore any

500
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,760
reachable uh value in this puzzle and

501
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,919
two does not divide three three is odd

502
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,360
not even and so we will never be able to

503
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,440
reach three because all the reachable

504
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,480
states are even that's a corollary now

505
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,000
of this

506
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,919
Lemma okay um

507
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,640
okay but how when in the good case in

508
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,919
the bad case it's easy to see I guess uh

509
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,520
how how do we know whether we're in a

510
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,000
good case or a bad case how do we know

511
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,320
whether X is a integer linear

512
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,919
combination of A and B given X and A and

513
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,200
B that is kind of the purpose of the

514
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,640
well some motivation for the rest of

515
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,799
this lecture we can use it for all sorts

516
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,840
of

517
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:55,799
things all right and I claim that this

518
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,440
is going to be true um if and only

519
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,240
if uh

520
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,240
this property is

521
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,880
true so now I'm going to restate this in

522
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,720
terms of divisibility this is this

523
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,480
equivalence is not obvious we'll prove

524
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,960
it by the end of today um so I claim

525
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,159
what what we really want to shows that

526
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,880
every common divisor of A and B remember

527
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,440
this is our definition of d is a common

528
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,480
divisor

529
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,880
uh common divisor of A and B divides a

530
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,360
and it divides B um then it should also

531
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,120
divide X so in the example uh we saw

532
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,480
that two was a common divisor of four

533
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,120
and six and so two better divide

534
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,360
anything that we make uh what are the

535
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,360
common divisors of five and

536
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,000
three three doesn't work five doesn't

537
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,919
work two doesn't work four doesn't work

538
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,679
I guess one is a common divisor one

539
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,559
divides

540
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,520
everything uh

541
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:59,360
so yeah that's also this is true in our

542
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,840
in our good case

543
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,200
uh and this we can rewrite in yet

544
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:10,279
another way which motivates our next

545
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:11,760
topic uh the gcd of A and B divides X

546
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,520
okay so I claim in particular this is

547
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
going to be a way to tell whether X is

548
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,120
an integer linear combination of A and B

549
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,480
you compute something called the gcd of

550
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,320
A and B and you see whether it divides X

551
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
so let's talk about gcd

552
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,720
gcd is another acronym it stands for uh

553
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,720
greatest common

554
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,360
divisor I assume it comes

555
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,960
from uh Britain in particular where they

556
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,600
use great to to indicate large uh so we

557
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,399
might call call this the largest common

558
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,720
divisor uh or the biggest common divisor

559
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:06,720
all synonyms for the same thing

560
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:14,440
um so this is the I'm going to give two

561
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:21,399
equivalent definitions of

562
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,399
gcd to me the more intuitive one is this

563
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,600
but it's a little bit uglier because it

564
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,080
has a special case so what I'd like to

565
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,600
say is the gcd of A and B is the largest

566
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,320
integer D such that D divides A and D

567
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,240
divides B again this is common common

568
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,679
divisor D is a common divisor of A and B

569
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,440
I want it to be the largest common

570
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:52,399
diviser that would be gcd uh but there's

571
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,159
one annoying special case which really

572
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,919
won't matter for the rest of lecture but

573
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,760
to be technically correct we should say

574
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,960
what happens when you compute the gcd of

575
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,440
Z and zero because remember every

576
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,880
integer D divides zero everything

577
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,799
divides zero so what's the largest

578
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,559
diviser of zero and zero I mean Infinity

579
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,640
I don't know it's like there is no such

580
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,559
integer that's the largest so there is

581
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,880
no largest integer uh so in this case it

582
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,240
turns out the right thing is to Define

583
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,799
gcd of 0 comma 0 to be zero that will be

584
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,679
a little counterintuitive maybe uh until

585
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,679
you see the next

586
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,279
definition Okay so

587
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,840
here's another

588
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:39,240
definition gcd is uh the only non-

589
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,240
negative common

590
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,440
divisor of A and

591
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:50,720
B uh divisible by all common divisors of

592
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,720
A and B

593
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,120
okay so uh another way to think about

594
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,600
the large the greatest common divisor is

595
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,559
it's greatest in terms of the

596
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:14,480
divisibility relation um the one that is

597
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,159
uh the most divisible by by other common

598
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,760
divisors so it turns out there's going

599
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,519
to be one common divisor that's both

600
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:24,799
non- negative and is divisible by all

601
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:28,640
common divisor of A and B uh so in these

602
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:34,440
examples uh for four and six gcd

603
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,440
of of 6 and four is going to be

604
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,640
two uh because the only let's see the

605
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,279
the common divisors if we think what are

606
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,880
all the common

607
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:49,240
divisors between four and

608
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,279
six uh maybe obvious there there's two

609
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,240
there's minus two uh there's one and

610
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,399
minus one zero divides nothing except

611
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,840
itself and all you can check all the

612
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:03,440
numbers between like6 and six uh those

613
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,919
are the possible divisors um and uh

614
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,159
these are the only ones that divide both

615
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,679
A and B and the

616
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:13,320
largest uh non- negative one here is two

617
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,240
and also it has the property that all of

618
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,559
these other common divisors divide

619
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,559
two okay so uh whichever way you want to

620
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,799
think about it you can use either

621
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,039
definition I'm not going to prove that

622
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:24,760
these definitions are equivalent we're

623
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,080
just going to take it as an axiom but

624
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,039
you can prove it uh this maybe an

625
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,039
exercise

626
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,799
uh so we but when we're proving things

627
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,760
about gcd we can use either of these

628
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:39,720
definitions whichever is more

629
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:42,240
convenient so let's um do one more

630
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,240
interesting

631
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,960
example which

632
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,559
is

633
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,159
gcd of I think I want to do zero first Z

634
00:30:52,559 --> 00:31:00,559
comma a so suppose I want to compute gcd

635
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,559
of two numbers maybe I should put a b

636
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:05,960
there uh and one of them is

637
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:08,320
zero any

638
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,000
guesses what the gcd of zero and B

639
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,000
should be remember everything divides

640
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:28,880
zero B is a good guess almost right what

641
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,880
if B was -7

642
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,039
should be absolute value of B so uh if

643
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,720
we want to handle positive and negative

644
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,720
things this turns out to be the right

645
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,080
answer uh here is a mini

646
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,320
proof uh there are two things we want to

647
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,039
check one is that absolute value of B is

648
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,600
a common divisor of zero and B uh so

649
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,799
well the absolute value of B this gets

650
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,399
notationally pretty gross divides zero

651
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,880
that's true because everything divides

652
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:03,000
zero uh and absolute value of B divides

653
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,679
B namely when we let K be uh1 or one

654
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,760
depending on whether B was positive or

655
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:14,320
negative or

656
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,320
zero um cool so uh good it is a common

657
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,159
divisor and now I want to claim that

658
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,519
it's the greatest common divisor

659
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,840
according to the second definition so

660
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,720
let's suppose that we had some number D

661
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,760
which divides zero and which divides

662
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,320
uh

663
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,240
B so d divid z and d divides B then uh I

664
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,200
claim in particular D also

665
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,559
divides uh the absolute value of

666
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,120
B Because if you divide a number you

667
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,600
also divide its negation just by

668
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,159
negating the value K that you're

669
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,120
multiplying by right if I take K * D and

670
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,120
I get b i then I take negative K * D and

671
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,000
I get absolute value of B if B happened

672
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,919
to be negative okay so that means if

673
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,200
you're a common diviser of zero and B

674
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,919
then you're also a common diviser of

675
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,039
this thing and that was our defin second

676
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,519
definition of gcd uh so great uh this

677
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,519
means we're

678
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,960
greatest okay uh now the the question

679
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:19,720
arises how do we compute gcd of A and B

680
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,880
because I claimed uh

681
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,960
over here that what we need to check is

682
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,600
whether gcd of ab divides X so given a

683
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,600
and b we need to be able to compute this

684
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,840
thing

685
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,000
how do we find the greatest common

686
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,720
divisor turns out there's a great

687
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,279
algorithm to do it and the base case of

688
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,399
that algorithm is this if we can get one

689
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,639
of the numbers down to zero then that we

690
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,159
found the

691
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,360
gcd okay so our goal now is given some

692
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:52,440
big numbers to make them smaller

693
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:56,240
somehow and the big idea here to make a

694
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,120
gcd algorithm is

695
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,399
subtraction how do we make numbers

696
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,679
smaller with arithmetic subtraction or

697
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,120
division seem like good ideas we're

698
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,040
going to use both starting with

699
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,159
subtraction

700
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:15,200
so I

701
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:17,760
claim gcd of ab equals gcd of a minus B

702
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:23,079
comma B comma

703
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,079
B uh for all integers

704
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,040
a so if a and b are big numbers this is

705
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,399
pretty cool this is saying we can

706
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,599
subtract one of the numbers from the

707
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,879
other and we get the same gcd somehow

708
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:38,159
okay we'll prove this in a

709
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:42,480
second now actually going leave a little

710
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,480
bit of space let's do

711
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,679
proof okay so um then we're going to

712
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,320
turn this into an algorithm but let's

713
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,320
first see why this is the case so

714
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,720
um we this is a statement about GC CD

715
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,240
gcd is this complicated definition uh

716
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,400
it's a little easier to think about all

717
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,480
common divisors you think about the

718
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,520
common divisors of A and B those are all

719
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,720
the numbers D where D divides A and D

720
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,520
divides B and you think of the common

721
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,880
divisors of a minus B and B I claim

722
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,880
these sets are the same so the set of

723
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,880
common

724
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:30,040
divisors of a and

725
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,040
b equals the set of common

726
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,040
divisors of a minus B and

727
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,160
B okay this is a kind of proof we

728
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,480
actually haven't seen in this class yet

729
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,280
uh this is the brace not a minus sign uh

730
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,839
when you want to prove two sets are

731
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,200
equal a very common template for such a

732
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:56,480
proof is to show that every element of

733
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,200
this set is also an element of this set

734
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,440
that if you recall back to our set

735
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,880
definitions in lecture one is that this

736
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,400
set is contained in this set and also to

737
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,000
prove that every element of the second

738
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,000
set is an element of the first set

739
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,680
that's saying the second set is a subset

740
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,560
of the first set so uh we're going to do

741
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:19,040
a proof in two parts one part one is to

742
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,720
show containment that the first set is

743
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,960
contained in the second set uh part two

744
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,720
over

745
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,640
here is to show containment in the other

746
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,040
direction this set is a suet of this set

747
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,640
okay if I can prove that these sets are

748
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,920
equal then in particular the maximum

749
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,480
element of these sets if it exists is

750
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,920
also going to be equal right if you have

751
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,440
two identical sets you take the max

752
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,000
you're going to get the same thing now

753
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,720
there's this one I'm using the first

754
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,480
definition here of course there's this

755
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,040
one case when the two numbers are zero

756
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,960
then there is no maximum because all

757
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,280
integers actually will be common

758
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,280
divisors of zero and zero but in that

759
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,800
case again if the sets are equal that

760
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,280
means that A and B or these numbers must

761
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,760
be zero and then of course these numbers

762
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,079
are also all zero and this this

763
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,440
statement is trivially true when

764
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,880
everything's zero okay it's just saying

765
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,440
gcd of 0 comma 0 equals gcd of 0 comma 0

766
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,960
that one I'm fine with but as long as

767
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,200
we're not in the z z case these sets

768
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,920
will be finite and if they're equal then

769
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,839
their maximums will be the same so this

770
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,720
is all I need to show let's do it in two

771
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:24,200
parts so first we suppose that we have a

772
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,280
common diviser of A and B so that means

773
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,400
D divides A and D divides B for some

774
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,880
number number

775
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:37,560
B um well I claim that also D divides a

776
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,160
minus B because a minus B is an integer

777
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,640
linear combination of A and B and we had

778
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,160
over here in our divisibility fact if D

779
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,960
divides A and D divides B then D divides

780
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,800
every integer linear combination of A

781
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,160
and B so we're plugging in s equal 1

782
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,839
tals minus one here and we get the D

783
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,480
divides a minus

784
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:02,760
B great so uh we have d divides A and D

785
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:07,160
divid A minus B so in other words uh we

786
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:11,119
have D divid A and D divides a minus B

787
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:13,520
and that sorry wrong one I want to D

788
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,520
divides

789
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,640
B and this is the meaning of a common

790
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,280
divisor of a minus B and B so we we

791
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,520
assumed that D was a common divisor of

792
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,440
this we proved that D was a common

793
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,000
divisor of these two numbers therefore

794
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,640
we have containment every element in

795
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,839
this set is contained in this set now

796
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,800
let's prove the reverse and that will

797
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,160
imply that these sets are equal so now

798
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,680
suppose that D divides a minus B and D

799
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,880
divides

800
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,880
B then I want to show that D divides

801
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,839
a

802
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:56,520
why any

803
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,440
suggestions can I use integer linear

804
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,440
combinations yeah

805
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:07,160
T equals z I agree if if I put T equals

806
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,560
0 and S equals 1 then integer this is an

807
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,119
integer linear combination of A and B

808
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,760
but in this case I don't know that D

809
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,200
divides a that's actually what I want to

810
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:20,440
prove so I can't use integer linear

811
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,760
combinations of A and B but you do Aus I

812
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,960
can take an integer linear combination

813
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:36,240
of a minus B and B if I do 1 * this uh

814
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:39,200
Plus 1 * this a - b * 1 + 1 * B is

815
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:43,400
a uh so in other words because this

816
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,000
equals the sum a minus B plus

817
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,839
b and because I know that D is a common

818
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,119
divisor of a minus B and B I know that D

819
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:53,720
also divides any interger linear

820
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,040
combination of those two numbers and in

821
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,720
particular

822
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:02,280
a cool so so both of these are using the

823
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,680
uh divisibility facts that if you have a

824
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,319
common divisor you also divide all

825
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,800
integer linear combinations of those two

826
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,400
numbers uh so in particular this means

827
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,680
we have D divides A and D divides B I'm

828
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,119
just taking this thing that we proved

829
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,000
and this thing that we

830
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,680
assumed and this says we have a common

831
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,800
if we had saying if we had a common

832
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,960
divisor of a minus B and B we also have

833
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,000
a common divisor of A and B so that says

834
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,079
every element in this second set is an

835
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,720
element of the first set and because we

836
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,480
have containment in both directions in

837
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,200
fact these two sets must be exactly the

838
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,480
same set so if you ever have to prove

839
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,599
the two sets are equal I recommend a

840
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,200
common template is to do it in two

841
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,760
halves like

842
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,680
this

843
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,040
okay great uh so I claim we can get an

844
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,240
algorithm out of

845
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:58,319
this out of this subtraction idea and

846
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,520
gcd of 0 comma B

847
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,960
so let's just do an example of that I

848
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,319
won't write a careful algorithm because

849
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,000
we're going to do

850
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,400
better let's say we want to do uh gcd of

851
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,240
9 comma

852
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,200
6 okay uh oh and maybe I want to write

853
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,599
another fact

854
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:27,400
here um does it

855
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:33,079
matter yeah I do uh so gcd of a comma B

856
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:35,760
is also equal to uh gcd of B comma a by

857
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,640
symmetry of this definition A and B

858
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,160
could be swapped and you get exactly the

859
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,760
same things we're talking about and if I

860
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:49,599
apply this subtraction Lemma uh with the

861
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:52,440
elements swapped what I get is uh gcd of

862
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,920
the first argument which is B minus the

863
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,720
second argument which is a comma the

864
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,920
second argument which is a

865
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,079
so um all these things are equal just

866
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,319
from the same subtraction LMA and using

867
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:07,040
the Symmetry uh but what this is saying

868
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:09,119
is either I can subtract the second

869
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,880
argument from the first and get a minus

870
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:18,119
b or uh I I can also rewrite this as gcd

871
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,319
of a comma B minus a alternatively I

872
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,599
could leave the first argument alone and

873
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,280
subtract it from the second argument so

874
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,079
I'm free to subtract whichever way I

875
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,599
want and I find it much easier to think

876
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,920
about non- negative numbers so I'm

877
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,079
always going to subtract the smaller

878
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,040
number from the bigger number I can do

879
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,640
it either way so let's do it

880
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:40,319
for uh 9 comma

881
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,280
6 so I'm going to subtract six from 9

882
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:47,240
and I get this is equal to so this would

883
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,119
be uh a minus B this one minus this one

884
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,640
uh is three 9 - 6 is three second

885
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,040
argument stays the same okay I still

886
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,319
don't know the answer so I'm going to

887
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,359
keep subtracting in this case I'll take

888
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:01,240
the smaller number subtract it from the

889
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:04,079
larger number so this is uh B minus a I

890
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,000
guess replacing B with B minus a I get

891
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:12,240
gcd

892
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:15,319
of sorry uh I wanted yeah 3 comma

893
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,680
3 subtract three from six I get three

894
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:19,079
okay this that looks pretty easy I'm

895
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,920
guessing gcd of three and three is three

896
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,520
uh but if we go all the way uh we can

897
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,839
subtract one of them from the other I

898
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,920
guess I want to do B minus a again and

899
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:34,440
we get 3 comma 0 and this we actually

900
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,400
analyzed over here uh we said gcd oh I

901
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,240
got it backwards but of zero comma

902
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,680
something is the absolute value of

903
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,720
something so absolute value of three is

904
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:49,839
three and so gcd of three comma 0 is

905
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:53,520
three okay great uh another

906
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:56,200
example gcd of 1 comma

907
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,319
100 okay well I take the smaller one

908
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,000
subtract it from the larger one I get

909
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,160
gcd of 1 comma

910
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,079
99 H okay now I subtract one from the

911
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:11,640
larger number I get gcd of 1 comma

912
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:14,599
98 and so on I won't bore you with the

913
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,000
details in the end the answer is one but

914
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:20,359
uh this is a very slow way to arrive at

915
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,280
the answer of one um I have to do a 100

916
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:25,599
steps to figure out the gcd of 1 comma

917
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,359
100 so the number of steps you get in

918
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,839
this algorithm which I haven't precis

919
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:35,680
defined is going to be uh roughly at

920
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:38,520
least in the worst case um the sum of a

921
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,240
and b or the maximum of A and B it

922
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,200
doesn't matter up to constant factors uh

923
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,640
and this is what we would call a slow

924
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,599
algorithm for in number

925
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,359
Theory because generally we want to

926
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,680
think about numbers that are huge you

927
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:56,079
know uh 100 bits long if you have a 100

928
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,680
bit long number that is as large as two

929
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,839
to the 100

930
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,319
and that's a very large number uh

931
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,680
it's big roughly the number of particles

932
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,079
in the known universe I think that's

933
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,720
about to the 128 or something so we

934
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,200
don't want to spend that much time uh to

935
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,760
compute this in fact we can do a lot

936
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,640
better using

937
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:23,000
a better technique which is division so

938
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,559
we've seen here uh the idea that we can

939
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,599
subtract one number from the other but

940
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,280
if we subtract and then subtract and

941
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,040
then we subtract and we subtract that

942
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,400
sounds a lot like division right this is

943
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,880
like the bad way to do division is to

944
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,559
repeatedly subtract one number from the

945
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,839
other and that's exactly what happens in

946
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,760
the 100 comma one case we have to

947
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,640
subtract one from 100 subtract it from

948
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:49,000
99 keep subtracting one until the left

949
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,079
hand side uh becomes larger than the

950
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,160
right hand side and then we can stop in

951
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,040
fact they become equal because one

952
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,640
divides 100 uh but in general we want to

953
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,559
keep subtracting on until we go beyond

954
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,119
or we would go beyond what we can afford

955
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:04,960
and that's exactly division so let me

956
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:09,880
give

957
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,880
you a very precise version of

958
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,480
division with something called the

959
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,640
division theorem this is one of the core

960
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,559
theorems

961
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:32,240
in number Theory we won't prove it here

962
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:35,960
it's kind of TS um for every integer n

963
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,240
and for every positive integer D so I'm

964
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,359
going to write z+ to mean uh D is

965
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,359
greater than

966
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:43,359
zero

967
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,680
uh there is a

968
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,280
unique

969
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,920
um and usually we would write this as

970
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,599
exists exclamation mark there is a

971
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,559
unique so you know this means there is

972
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,640
exclamation mark it's really exists but

973
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:09,079
there's only one of them uh there exists

974
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:12,760
a unique uh pair of

975
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:15,440
integers uh q and

976
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,559
R uh I don't want the parentheses

977
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:23,119
actually uh I want to say those are both

978
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,119
integers um such

979
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:36,960
that and n = q * D +

980
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:38,119
R and R is between zero and strictly

981
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,760
less than

982
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:45,200
D okay you actually have seen this in

983
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,559
other terms probably before uh this Q is

984
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:52,000
what we would call the

985
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:53,760
quotient and this R is what we call the

986
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,119
remainder I'm sure you've heard those

987
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,440
terms before this is like a very precise

988
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,040
way to say what division gives us in all

989
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,000
cases

990
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,960
given uh a numerator and a

991
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,040
denominator that's why they're called n

992
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,400
and D here um and as long as D is uh not

993
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,760
zero we're going to furthermore assume

994
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,920
that it's positive so it's easier to

995
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,599
think about um then there's a unique

996
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,920
quotient and remainder you get from

997
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:24,240
dividing A over

998
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,559
B right Q is how many whole copies of D

999
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,520
you can fit inside n and R is whatever

1000
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:33,559
is left over so that's roughly a proof

1001
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,839
that this is true um and it if you think

1002
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,839
about what the remainder should be it

1003
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,359
could be zero in the zero case that's

1004
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:43,520
when we have divisibility right if D

1005
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:46,640
divides n if n equals Q * D that's

1006
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,920
exactly divisibility if there's no R

1007
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,599
that's when R equals z that's what we

1008
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,680
get uh but in general we know R should

1009
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,000
also be less than D because if if there

1010
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,599
was D left over we would just increase Q

1011
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,240
one that would be a whole copy of D so

1012
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,200
the remainder is always going to be

1013
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,960
between zero and strictly less than

1014
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:10,160
D okay uh I guess the the interesting

1015
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,960
part here is that there's only one sorry

1016
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,920
I should have put an i in unique uh

1017
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,200
there's only one way to do this um that

1018
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,520
with these conditions there's only one

1019
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,319
uh quotient and

1020
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:27,960
remainder okay uh I also want to give

1021
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:27,960
you some definitions some notation

1022
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:38,960
which is uh for the quotient we write

1023
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:43,119
the numerator div D div for division uh

1024
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,280
and for the remainder we write n remd

1025
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,680
REM for

1026
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,040
remainder uh this is also sometimes

1027
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,480
called n mod D so if you ever see that

1028
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,520
we probably won't use it in this form

1029
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,160
we're going to use mod to mean a

1030
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,319
slightly related slightly different

1031
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,240
notion um also the textbook uh they

1032
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,040
write REM as a as a two argument

1033
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,720
function but same

1034
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,720
idea okay so uh we're going to use

1035
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:12,680
division theorem a lot from now on and

1036
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,839
as a way to uh reduce our numbers again

1037
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,760
in a more powerful way than subtraction

1038
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:20,319
so we would like to do subtraction

1039
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,640
repeatedly and what will we be left with

1040
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,920
we'll be left with the remainder if you

1041
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,640
keep subtracting until you can't

1042
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,280
subtract anymore that's remainder

1043
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,799
okay so let's do

1044
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,680
[Applause]

1045
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:37,160
that probably still need this

1046
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,160
divisibility facts I'll leave it

1047
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,520
there

1048
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,119
okay so this is gcd

1049
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,920
division

1050
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,640
theorem

1051
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,520
um if let's suppose a is less than or

1052
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:09,880
equal to B is less than or equal to

1053
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,119
one that what I want no way around that

1054
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,680
seems weird be weird to be at most one I

1055
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,040
want things to be non- negative so I'm

1056
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,799
going to assume a is the bigger one of A

1057
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,079
and B and I want to compute gcd of a

1058
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:20,079
comma

1059
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,440
B and I'm going to assume we haven't

1060
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,240
gotten down to zero in particular

1061
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,680
because I can't divide by zero uh but

1062
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,280
also because when we get to zero we're

1063
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,960
done if one of the numbers is zero we're

1064
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,599
happy so let's assume they're both at

1065
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,160
least one and let's assume by symmetry

1066
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:41,319
that a the one on the left is bigger or

1067
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:45,799
equal uh then I claim gcd of a is gcd of

1068
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:45,799
a remainder B comma

1069
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:52,880
B okay uh so before we had a minus B and

1070
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,880
now we have a remainder B seems like a

1071
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,960
small difference and indeed the proof is

1072
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,960
basically the same

1073
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,680
um I'm going to do a proof sketch which

1074
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:08,280
is to say well gcd of a comma B is equal

1075
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:11,160
to gcd of a minus B comma B uh and if we

1076
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:16,680
apply by the subtraction theorem uh

1077
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:18,000
which we just did over over there um and

1078
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,920
if we apply the subtraction theorem

1079
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,119
again we can subtract the right argument

1080
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:26,520
from the left one again A minus 2 B

1081
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:34,400
comma B and so on eventually we get to

1082
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:34,400
to gcd of a minus um a div B *

1083
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:41,280
B right a div B is how many whole copies

1084
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:43,200
of B I can fit into a and so if I take

1085
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,440
that number multiply it by B that's how

1086
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,880
much uh I can subtract away before a

1087
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,480
would go negative if I subtracted one

1088
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:58,440
more time and what I'll be left with is

1089
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,440
exactly the remainder a minus uh a remb

1090
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:06,160
times uh oh no times comma B If I

1091
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,280
subtract off that many copies of B I

1092
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:12,680
will be left with uh a remainder B sorry

1093
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,680
no a

1094
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,200
minus okay that's

1095
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:22,000
uh that's what we're writing here in

1096
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:27,839
fact so we wrote uh let me rewrite this

1097
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
um we have n or maybe I'll write it as

1098
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:33,559
uh Want A or

1099
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:44,000
B I'll stick with that what this over

1100
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:48,359
here is saying is uh n div D * D plus n

1101
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,119
RM D equals to n okay I'm just rewriting

1102
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:53,839
this formula using the notations for Q

1103
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:58,119
and R and if I rearrange this I get that

1104
00:53:53,839 --> 00:54:01,839
n minus n divd

1105
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:03,920
* D equals

1106
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:06,640
ND okay and that's exactly what I'm

1107
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,200
using here the remainder is what you get

1108
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,440
what's left over if you take uh the

1109
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:14,040
numerator and subtract off uh the div

1110
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,559
many copies of the denominator so I use

1111
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,040
dot dot dot here you can't really use

1112
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,920
dot dot dot in a proof technically this

1113
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,359
is a proof by induction but I think

1114
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,960
hopefully you're familiar enough with

1115
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,559
induction that you could turn this into

1116
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,559
a formal proof it's not hard

1117
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:35,440
okay so we can

1118
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:37,280
divide and uh this will make this gcd

1119
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,200
algorithm much faster because now if I

1120
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:43,720
want to uh say to compute gcd of 1 comma

1121
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:45,680
100 this is the same thing as gcd of 100

1122
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:50,520
comma

1123
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,280
1 and what that says is I can divide 100

1124
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,559
by

1125
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,640
one and see what the remainder is well

1126
00:54:53,559 --> 00:55:00,000
one divides 100 so the remainder is zero

1127
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,599
so I instantly get that this is gcd of 0

1128
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,839
comma 1

1129
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,280
boom uh I'm done this gcd of Zer comma

1130
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:09,960
anything is the

1131
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,559
anything so in like one step now one

1132
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,640
division instead of having to do a bunch

1133
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:17,359
of subtractions I compute the

1134
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:20,359
gcd great let's write this down as an

1135
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,359
algorithm

1136
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:44,799
this is called ukis algorithm or the

1137
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,799
ukian

1138
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:51,280
algorithm it's called UK's algorithm

1139
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,400
because uclid was not the first to

1140
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,760
discover it of course uh but he was

1141
00:55:53,400 --> 00:56:00,440
still pretty early uh around 300C C uh

1142
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:05,280
but I'll mention an earlier version in

1143
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,280
in a moment uh so what this does is it

1144
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,720
computes gcd of

1145
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,359
ab uh

1146
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,480
for a greater than or equal to B greater

1147
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:18,119
than or equal to zero okay I'm going to

1148
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,520
assume everything's not negative if it's

1149
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,480
negative just negate it I'm going to

1150
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,720
assume the left argument is is bigger

1151
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,880
than the right one or equal uh if it's

1152
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,400
the other way around swap A and B okay

1153
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,400
so this is enough for computing gcd of

1154
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,880
any two

1155
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,799
integers um and I'm going to write this

1156
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,960
of course as a state

1157
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,200
machine so in general I'm going to have

1158
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,599
a pair of integers A and B where a is

1159
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,960
greater than equal to B uh greater equal

1160
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,839
to

1161
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:52,400
zero uh so I guess I should say the

1162
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:54,960
states are X comma y uh

1163
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:59,240
where X is greater equal to Y is greater

1164
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,240
than equal to zero and then the

1165
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:14,799
transitions go from X comma y to X REM

1166
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,799
y Oh wrong

1167
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:26,160
order y comma X Ram

1168
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:29,599
y okay almost the same as this theorem

1169
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:33,640
except I'm going to rewrite this as gcd

1170
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:36,000
of B comma a rem B just flip the

1171
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,240
arguments because I would like the left

1172
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,359
argument to always be greater than or

1173
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,880
equal to I would like the left argument

1174
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:43,720
to be always greater than or equal to

1175
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,400
the right argument um and if I do them

1176
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,920
in this order if x was greater than

1177
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,839
equal to Y I do this division this

1178
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,799
division will of course be less than y

1179
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:54,280
and so the left one will be bigger than

1180
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:56,799
the right one actually

1181
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,000
strictly in that case

1182
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,559
okay uh so that's basically just

1183
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,400
following this rule

1184
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,960
repeatedly and those are my

1185
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,640
transitions uh now this only

1186
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:12,039
works uh when Y is bigger than

1187
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:17,960
zero if Y is

1188
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:19,720
zero uh at um X comma 0 we

1189
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,839
return

1190
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:25,960
X as the

1191
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:27,599
gcd that's the final state or there

1192
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,119
these these are various final States any

1193
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,440
X comma 0 is going to be a final State

1194
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,760
there's no transition out of there

1195
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,960
because we're not allowed to divide by

1196
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,200
zero because I wrote this for all y

1197
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,119
greater than zero rule but at that in

1198
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:42,359
that situation we know the gcd of 0

1199
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,799
comma b or B comma 0 is the absolute

1200
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:47,400
value of B because everything here is

1201
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:51,280
non- negative uh the answer is X at that

1202
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:54,720
point so why does this

1203
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:59,720
work well because we just proved an

1204
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:03,799
invariant that uh as this machine

1205
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:08,200
runs um I want to say p of

1206
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:09,000
XY is the state predicate which is uh

1207
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:14,000
the

1208
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
gcd of X comma y equals the gcd of a

1209
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,599
comma

1210
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,960
B right whatever we designed the change

1211
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:23,160
in arguments here we started with a

1212
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,240
comma B so this is true initially in our

1213
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,599
initial State a comma B of course gcd of

1214
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:30,079
a comma b equals gcd of a comma B and

1215
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,760
then every time we do a transition and

1216
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,559
we do this Division and take the

1217
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,960
remainder we still have we know that the

1218
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,960
gcds are equal by this

1219
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,200
theorem right that's exactly what this

1220
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:45,480
tells us and so this is saying this

1221
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,760
theorem tells us that this state

1222
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,079
predicate is preserved and because it

1223
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:56,280
holds initially that means it's

1224
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:56,280
invariant okay uh true initially

1225
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,359
uh and it's

1226
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:07,559
preserved by this theorem and so by the

1227
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:09,839
invariant principle we know that this

1228
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:13,720
will remain true for any reachable state

1229
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:14,640
XY we'll have gcd of XY equal gcd of ab

1230
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,319
and

1231
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:21,160
furthermore uh when we get to a final

1232
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:21,160
state so this is a final

1233
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:30,079
State uh we know that this answer is

1234
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:33,319
correct because gcd of X comma 0 equals

1235
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,880
X for non- Negative X so this was this

1236
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:40,000
is partial

1237
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,000
correctness if we get to a final

1238
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,920
State uh

1239
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:50,799
gcd of X comma 0 equals

1240
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:53,200
X for X greater than equal to Z by this

1241
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:56,960
theorem that we

1242
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,119
proved Okay so if this machine

1243
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,839
terminates we're

1244
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:05,280
done and I claim this machine does

1245
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:09,000
terminate so let's prove

1246
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,000
termination in a couple of

1247
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:15,599
ways so how do we prove termination of

1248
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,079
State machines we

1249
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:22,400
Define uh some value some function of

1250
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:24,480
States that's an integer a non- negative

1251
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,480
integer and we show that it strictly

1252
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,240
decreases that's our main tool for

1253
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:33,240
proving termination of algorithms uh so

1254
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:34,839
for example we could uh take the

1255
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:38,640
function X+

1256
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:38,640
y this strictly

1257
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,599
decreases why uh just think about a

1258
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:51,880
transition we start with X comma y y

1259
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,480
doesn't change and then the other term

1260
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,599
in the sum used to be X and then it

1261
01:01:53,480 --> 01:02:00,279
becomes X remainder y so we're dividing

1262
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,920
X by y so X gets smaller in that process

1263
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:04,240
and so the sum of these two values is

1264
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:07,160
going to be smaller than the sum of X

1265
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,480
and Y so that's cool we now know that

1266
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:14,039
this algorithm terminates um but stating

1267
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,839
it using this

1268
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:18,799
uh function is not so great because it

1269
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:26,000
tells us that the number of

1270
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:27,599
steps uh is uh at most a plus b

1271
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,920
but that's not great that's that's what

1272
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:33,880
we had before uh from our slow algorithm

1273
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,640
we got a running time of a plus b like

1274
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,119
so that's still true it's an upper bound

1275
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:41,119
on the running time but I claim that in

1276
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:45,799
fact our running time is much

1277
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:49,200
smaller by a more clever proof let me

1278
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:49,200
erase subtraction

1279
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:15,400
okay so I

1280
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,400
claim uh in

1281
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:24,720
fact if we look at the bit count of X

1282
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:27,760
and the bit count of Y in summation this

1283
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,760
also strictly decreases

1284
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,839
what is a bit count this is if you write

1285
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,880
X in binary how many bits are there

1286
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:39,720
what's the length of the binary

1287
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:46,160
representation of X um this is

1288
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:50,359
essentially 1 + log base 2 of X

1289
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:54,720
ceiling a little gross but uh ASM

1290
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:57,279
totically this is log base 2 of

1291
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,760
x or when you use ASM totic notation you

1292
01:03:57,279 --> 01:04:01,319
don't even need the base because it only

1293
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,799
makes uh constant Factor difference so

1294
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:08,680
this is roughly log of x it's Theta log

1295
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:10,920
of x this is Theta log of Y so uh the

1296
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:16,520
number of

1297
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:19,400
steps is order log X Plus log

1298
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,880
Y and that's really good that's

1299
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,960
exponentially faster sorry I should have

1300
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:27,799
written uh log a plus log B because

1301
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,240
that's where we start is a a comma B so

1302
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:31,079
if I give you two numbers A and B I can

1303
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,279
compute the gcd in roughly

1304
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:37,079
logarithmically many divisions whereas

1305
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:39,480
before we did a plus b now we have log a

1306
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:42,240
plus log B so that's what we call an

1307
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,640
exponential Improvement and this is a

1308
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,720
what we would call a fast algorithm

1309
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,760
because now if I have a 100 bit integer

1310
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,839
it only takes me like or or two 100 bit

1311
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,200
integers it only takes me around 100

1312
01:04:50,839 --> 01:04:56,680
steps whereas before is taking me two to

1313
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,559
the 100 steps big difference

1314
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,079
okay uh why is this true why is bit

1315
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,079
count of X Plus bit count of Y strictly

1316
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,880
decreasing um

1317
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:08,039
because I

1318
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:14,839
claim so I should say

1319
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:18,599
because XR Y is less than x over2 this

1320
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:20,240
is another fact about division um I

1321
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:24,520
think

1322
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,920
the intuition here is uh Y is smaller

1323
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,079
than x when we're doing this Division

1324
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:32,880
and so we can remove at least one whole

1325
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:36,640
copy of Y from X and maybe we remove

1326
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:39,240
more but um yeah you can think about

1327
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,920
when y if Y is more than half X then

1328
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,760
just in the first step we've removed

1329
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:47,160
half of X and so we've gotten down to

1330
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:49,559
less than x over two um if x is smaller

1331
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,480
if Y is really small like one then we're

1332
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:53,720
going to be able to eat all of x uh in

1333
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,400
both cases you'll end up uh eating at

1334
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:58,480
least half of X and so in general the

1335
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,039
remainder will be less than half of X

1336
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,000
over2 and so if we start with X and we

1337
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,039
in the next step we get to X over2 or

1338
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,880
smaller that means we removed one bit

1339
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,240
from the binary representation or if you

1340
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,119
think about it in log base 2 we've if we

1341
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,640
have the number log base two goes down

1342
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,799
by one so even with the ceiling it goes

1343
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:18,279
down by

1344
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:22,880
one okay so that's why this uclid

1345
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:25,920
algorithm is fast and good that's why we

1346
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,520
love it um I have for you a little of

1347
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,400
the algorithm and then we'll talk about

1348
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,839
extensions so here uh on the screen

1349
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:36,559
we're Computing gcd of 189 and

1350
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,920
66 if we think of that as a rectangle

1351
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:42,440
189 by

1352
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,440
606 uh then doing a division is like

1353
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,599
Square

1354
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:51,319
packing um so

1355
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:54,799
here if we have an A by B rectangle and

1356
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:58,160
a and b is the smaller one uh then a b

1357
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:59,880
by B squ like subtracting off B and so

1358
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,119
uh if you think of the whole rectangle

1359
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,839
it's how many squares can I subtract off

1360
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:05,760
and what we'll be left with is the

1361
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,640
remainder because one dimension stays

1362
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,400
the same the other dimension gets

1363
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,119
reduced to the remainder so hopefully

1364
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,480
that's clear why the geometric view of

1365
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,240
squares is the same as what we've been

1366
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,480
doing with UK's algorithm makes for a

1367
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,920
much nicer picture and then you take

1368
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,079
that rectangle and you flip it so that

1369
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:23,119
the horizontal Dimensions bigger you

1370
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,599
take off as many squares as you can and

1371
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,960
you flip and you take off as many

1372
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,359
squares as you can here's just just one

1373
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,680
that's just a subtraction you flip uh

1374
01:07:28,359 --> 01:07:31,559
you take off as many squares as you can

1375
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,760
you left with a remainder of three by

1376
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:36,440
six uh and now here we get even Division

1377
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,400
and so one of the dimensions becomes

1378
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,760
zero and then the gcd of three and zero

1379
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,599
is uh

1380
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,920
three

1381
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:48,000
cool so if that helps great if not don't

1382
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,400
worry uh hopefully you can now compute

1383
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,480
gcd uh we will do another example in a

1384
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,839
second I would like to first uh

1385
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,559
strengthen this algorithm and make it uh

1386
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,160
do more

1387
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:01,480
because remember we wanted to compute

1388
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:05,839
gcd uh why we wanted to see whether gcd

1389
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:08,119
of ab divided X because if the gcd of ab

1390
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:11,880
divides X then all common divisors of A

1391
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:13,720
and B will divide x uh and what the

1392
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,359
reason we cared about that is I claimed

1393
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:18,000
it was the same thing as X being an

1394
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,960
integer linear combination of A and B

1395
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,719
but where did the integer linear

1396
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,719
combinations go all we've done so far is

1397
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:25,560
compute gcd of ab well it turns out

1398
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:28,600
there's a connection

1399
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:31,000
and the connection is called bezus

1400
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:34,520
theorem or

1401
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,759
LMA it's called bazus Lemma because B is

1402
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,880
like the last person to discover it

1403
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:41,600
after uh in

1404
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:45,440
1779 after another French mathematician

1405
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:49,880
mesak uh in 1624 and after uh two Indian

1406
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:53,719
mathematicians around 500 uh AC so uh

1407
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,719
but we call it Biz LMA

1408
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,319
this is the

1409
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:07,839
connection uh gcd of ab is an integer

1410
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:10,239
linear combination of A and B and we can

1411
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:13,400
prove this using UK's

1412
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:15,560
algorithm is pretty

1413
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:21,159
cool we're going

1414
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:21,159
to uh buy ukids algorithm

1415
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,279
okay uh let me do this

1416
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,199
quickly let's assume a is greater equal

1417
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,480
to B again if not we can just swap A and

1418
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:43,679
B and I guess we'll assume greater equal

1419
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:46,799
to zero so we can apply ul's

1420
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,520
algorithm uh UK's algorithm tells us or

1421
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:52,640
the theorem we proved before UK's

1422
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:57,320
algorithm tells us gcd of ab equals gcd

1423
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,320
of B comma a rem B

1424
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:04,960
uh

1425
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,960
and we can use induction

1426
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,760
Now by strong

1427
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:19,080
induction on a plus b so this is very

1428
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:21,640
similar to what we were saying here uh X

1429
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:24,400
Plus y strictly decreases it's all we

1430
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:26,440
need for induction to work here so we're

1431
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,400
assuming by induction

1432
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,880
that if a plus b is smaller than the

1433
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:33,760
current value then gcd of AA B is an

1434
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:36,080
integ linear combination of A and B and

1435
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,560
so here we have gcd of A and B and we've

1436
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,880
reduced it to gcd of some smaller values

1437
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,640
or whose sum is smaller and so we can

1438
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,000
apply strong induction to the this

1439
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,440
pair uh and so we'll get that this gcd

1440
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,239
is an integer linear combination of its

1441
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:56,800
arguments so

1442
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:56,800
let's continue here

1443
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:07,520
so by strong induction we get that uh

1444
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,679
gcd of B comma a ram

1445
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:15,159
B uh is an integer linear

1446
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:17,719
combination of b and a rem

1447
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:20,000
B okay and this value of course is equal

1448
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:23,840
to gcd of

1449
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,760
ab by this equality and so uh we get

1450
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,239
that the gcd we care about is integer

1451
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:32,600
linear combination not of A and B but of

1452
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:35,719
this reduced version b and a rem B okay

1453
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,920
that's kind of annoying but it turns out

1454
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:41,880
uh a r

1455
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:43,199
b is an integer linear combination of A

1456
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,480
and

1457
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:49,920
B Why by the division

1458
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:56,280
theorem actually wrote it out over here

1459
01:11:49,920 --> 01:12:00,040
we wrote that NR D is n minus something

1460
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:03,040
time D that is this thing is an integer

1461
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:07,199
linear combination of N and

1462
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:08,719
d and so if I'm if I'm doing a rem B I

1463
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:13,199
get that it's a

1464
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:14,520
minus uh something the div times uh B so

1465
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,760
that's an integer linear combination of

1466
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:21,520
A and

1467
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:23,880
B okay so what we're left with is we

1468
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,560
have that this gcd that we care about is

1469
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,120
an integer linear combination of B and

1470
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,400
something else that is an integer linear

1471
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:33,520
combination of A and B so in other words

1472
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,760
we have an integer linear combination of

1473
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:39,040
two integer linear combinations of A and

1474
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:41,080
B Because B is definitely an integer

1475
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:43,320
linear combination of A and B it's 0 * a

1476
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:46,280
plus 1 time b a rem B is an integer

1477
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:48,360
linear combination as written over there

1478
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:50,560
and so now we're just taking an integer

1479
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:53,320
linear combination of those two things

1480
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,400
and that's also an integer linear

1481
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:59,960
combination

1482
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:02,800
of A and B as we showed

1483
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:05,560
before okay so that's maybe a little

1484
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,159
abstract but it does prove the theorem

1485
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:10,000
now I'm going to turn that into an

1486
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:14,400
algorithm cool

1487
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,400
algorithm uh maybe over

1488
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:24,679
[Applause]

1489
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:24,679
here which is called the pulverizer

1490
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,920
I mentioned ucl's algorithm was

1491
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,360
discovered before uid in fact a stronger

1492
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,199
version of ID's algorithm called the

1493
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:36,560
pulverizer was Des uh described by Arab

1494
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:42,360
Bata an Indian mathematician around 500

1495
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:44,840
AC so uh long time ago and he called it

1496
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,920
kutaka which is sanskrit for

1497
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,639
pulverization so we're going to call

1498
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:53,520
this the pulverizer most people call

1499
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:53,520
this the extended ukian algorithm

1500
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,280
uh and it's basically run ID's algorithm

1501
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,600
but also keep in mind what's going on in

1502
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:09,040
beus LMA and always keep track of X and

1503
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,840
Y as an integer linear combination of A

1504
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:14,840
and B okay so that's the

1505
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:18,880
intuition uh as a state machine it's

1506
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:23,520
quite simple kind of simple

1507
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:30,280
A10 B 01 is where we start because a

1508
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:32,360
equal 1 * a + 0 * B and B = 0 * a + 1 *

1509
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:35,120
B so that's how we represent a and b as

1510
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:37,719
integer linear combinations of A and B

1511
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,400
pretty trivial and then our transitions

1512
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:45,840
if we have X

1513
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:51,440
St so this means u x = s * a + T *

1514
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:56,880
B and we have uh y u v so in other words

1515
01:14:51,440 --> 01:15:02,320
we've represented y as U * s plus v *

1516
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:05,280
sorry uh V time U * a plus v *

1517
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,280
B then we transition

1518
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,280
to

1519
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,239
uh that's a mistake this should be y UV

1520
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,159
uh we we as usual we just copy y to the

1521
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:22,560
left argument we don't change it and

1522
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:26,159
then X changes to um x r

1523
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:31,239
y and then it turns out you can

1524
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:34,280
write uh you can figure out how XR Y is

1525
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:37,840
relative to the as a linear combination

1526
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,840
of A and B like

1527
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,760
this it's kind of a little

1528
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:54,120
gross okay so we started with

1529
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:56,600
representing X as uh s * a plus T * B

1530
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:59,840
and we take s and we subtract off a

1531
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:02,080
corrective term which is XD y time

1532
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:05,040
either U or V where U or V is what

1533
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:08,480
represented y okay if you work it out

1534
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:11,159
that's exactly what we were doing here

1535
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,679
we started with one number and we uh

1536
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:17,199
subtracted off the div times what we had

1537
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:19,800
before so if you stare at it at this

1538
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:21,880
equation long enough uh this is exactly

1539
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,000
what we're doing but in uh integer

1540
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:29,280
linear combination space of A and B

1541
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,639
um so I'm not going to justify this

1542
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:35,600
anymore and I won't even show an example

1543
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:38,800
but it gives you this is a particular

1544
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:41,360
way to compute it um and I I'll say at

1545
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,320
the beginning of an example if you have

1546
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,320
51

1547
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,440
0301 and you run this a few times you

1548
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:51,760
get

1549
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:55,320
to

1550
01:16:51,760 --> 01:17:02,560
um 2 1us

1551
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:09,440
1 1 -1 2 and this part tells us that 1

1552
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:15,199
equals -1 * 5 + 2 * 3 I hope that is

1553
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:17,840
correct uh - 5 + 6 is 1 yep okay so this

1554
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:19,840
is how you represent one as an integer

1555
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,679
linear combination of five and three one

1556
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,600
is interesting because it's the gcd of

1557
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,239
five and three I'm this is connecting to

1558
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,920
the water pouring right with water

1559
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:31,000
pouring we had a container of size five

1560
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,719
container of size three their gcd is one

1561
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,719
they have basically no common divisors

1562
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:37,719
except one and minus one uh and we can

1563
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:40,639
represent the gcd as an integer linear

1564
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:42,400
combination of five and three namely

1565
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:43,920
this one therefore we can represent four

1566
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,600
as an integer linear combination of 5

1567
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:50,600
and three we just multiply both sides by

1568
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:53,360
four and we get minus 4 * 5 plus 8 * 3

1569
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:54,880
is one way to do it and uh that gives

1570
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,400
you at least a way to solve this problem

1571
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:00,000
problem it turns out you can take uh

1572
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:03,440
eight copies of three and subtract out

1573
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,239
four copies of five how do I do that um

1574
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:09,239
well I just fill this up eight times in

1575
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:12,199
total and each time I pour in uh all

1576
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:14,520
that I can into the thing of size five

1577
01:18:12,199 --> 01:18:17,679
and each time it overflows I empty out

1578
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,920
the five and so that's exactly how I can

1579
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:23,719
build any integer linear combination of

1580
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,920
five and three by start as long as one

1581
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:27,080
side is positive and the other is

1582
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,760
negative which turns out to be necessary

1583
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:32,560
um then you can just take that many

1584
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,239
copies of filling up one bucket pouring

1585
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,040
it into the other removing whenever it

1586
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,360
overflows and you will get uh exactly

1587
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:42,800
the number you wanted for these numbers

1588
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:45,239
one two pores of three uh into five will

1589
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,920
give you one uh if you multiply this by

1590
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:49,400
four I get the number four and I save

1591
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:54,920
Manhattan

1592
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:54,920
great good luck on your quiz on Thursday
