1
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,039
in this video we'll look at an

2
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:17,279
application of the probabilistic method

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,199
to graph

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,680
Theory an independent set in a graph is

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:26,320
a subset of vertices with no two

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,279
adjacent for example if the graph is

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,800
this cycle on four vertices

8
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:38,280
an example of an independent set would

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,360
be two vertices like this and these two

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,559
vertices do not uh none these two

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,480
vertices are not adjacent to each

12
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,239
other whereas had I chosen two vertices

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,440
on the same Edge that would not be an

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,640
independent

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,039
set so important question in many in

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,840
graph theory is given the graph what can

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
you say about the size of its

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,120
independent sets

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,799
the following theorem due to Kon way

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,240
says that every graph G contains a large

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,200
independent set in the following sense

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,960
contains an independent set of size at

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,360
least the following quantity summing

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:24,320
over o v among vertices in

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,920
G one over the degree of V +

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,560
one

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,320
okay so this let let us prove this

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,479
theorem first and then we'll see an

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,600
application and some ways to interpret

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,159
this

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,079
result the proof of this theorem applies

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,479
the probabilistic

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,520
method okay so we are given this graph

34
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:53,360
G and the first thing we'll do is

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,360
order the vertices of

36
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,719
g uniformly at random

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,200
so consider a random permutation of the

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,920
vertices of

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,599
G and

40
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,400
let's consider the set I of

41
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:21,120
vertices def find as

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,519
follows these are the vertices in G such

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,519
that V

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
appears before

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,280
all its

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,640
neighbors

47
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,640
in the random

48
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,440
ordering okay for example from the graph

49
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,440
earlier had we ordered the

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,519
vertices in this order so that's say

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,120
some random ordering so let's order the

52
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:08,720
vertices is 1 2 3 and four okay so the

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,959
edges are 1 to 2 2 to

54
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,319
4 3 to 4 and 1 to

55
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,159
three what I would pick out is a set of

56
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,959
vertices such

57
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,599
that okay okay so let's see if each

58
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,080
vertex would belong to I the first

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,159
vertex appears before all of its

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,519
neighbors so we put the first vertex in

61
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,439
I the second ver vertex does not appear

62
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,760
before one of its neighbors one so we do

63
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:40,439
not put it in I and the third vertex

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,120
here also does not appear before its

65
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,720
neighbor and we don't put it in I and

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,319
the fourth vertex likewise does not

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,159
appear before all of its neighbors and

68
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,519
we do not put it in is well so in this

69
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,280
case this set picks up only the first

70
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,480
vertex but in more complicated graphs it

71
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,480
can pick up additional vertices

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,079
I claim

73
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,159
that I is

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,120
always an independent

75
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,639
set indeed it will be impossible to have

76
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,199
two vertices in I that are adjacent to

77
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,639
each other because one of them would

78
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,120
appear before the other in the order and

79
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,639
that would violate the condition on how

80
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,639
we chose

81
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:41,280
I next let's think about how large I is

82
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
for

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,440
every vertex V in

84
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,280
G the

85
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:56,080
probability that

86
00:04:50,280 --> 00:05:01,080
V is in I well this is the probability

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
that b appears

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,800
first

89
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,800
among V and its

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,120
neighbors well V has D subv the degree

91
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,440
of V neighbors and all the ordering are

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,600
chosen uniformly at random so this

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:31,720
probability is 1 / the degree of v+

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,800
1 and thus by theine ity of expectations

95
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:40,240
the expected size

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:43,120
of this set I is equal to the sum

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,639
over vertices V in

98
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:52,560
G of the probability that this V Lies in

99
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,560
I and we just computed this

100
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,120
probability as

101
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,080
such this is the expectation that's what

102
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,039
happens on average

103
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,560
therefore there must be some

104
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,479
ordering that

105
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:18,280
induces an I so there is some

106
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:21,360
I with the size of I at

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,360
least the quantity that we

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,360
just

109
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,560
produced okay so that finishes the proof

110
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,560
of

111
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,840
the Carol way

112
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,840
theorem again it says the one the way

113
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,080
they think about this theorem is that if

114
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,039
you are given a graph G such that

115
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,599
typically one does not have large

116
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,240
degrees then it must contain a lot of

117
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,240
inde a large independent

118
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,160
set by considering the complement of

119
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,160
this graph G

120
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,599
by

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,360
considering the graph complement the

122
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,360
graph complement means that

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,479
we switch flip the edge and non edges

124
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,639
right so so this is a graph G and then

125
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,720
this will be the complement of G so flip

126
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,759
the edges and non-edges in

127
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,879
G independent sets

128
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:37,479
in G become

129
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,319
Clicks in the complement the clicks are

130
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,280
complete graphs with all the edges

131
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:47,280
present okay and vice

132
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:49,759
versa so we can read carway theorem for

133
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,199
the complement of G to deduce the

134
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,199
following

135
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,440
corollary says that every

136
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,840
and

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,240
vertex graph G

138
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,720
contains a

139
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:20,599
click of

140
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,599
on at

141
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,440
least this many vertices

142
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,200
okay so the expression inside the

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:45,039
summation is the click of uh is the

144
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,039
complement the degree in the

145
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,360
complement

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,680
okay let us derive a interesting

147
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,320
corollary of uh of the scary and this

148
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,880
turns out to be a pretty foundational

149
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,880
result in graph Theory known as teron

150
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,000
theorem ton themm says the

151
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,360
following

152
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,360
if an nver

153
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,760
graph

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:49,640
has more than the following number 1

155
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:53,120
minus 1/ r n^ 2 / 2 so it has more than

156
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,120
this many

157
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
edges

158
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,200
then the

159
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:06,399
graph

160
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,399
contains a

161
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,160
click

162
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,160
on more than R

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,079
vertices so tons theorem gives us some

164
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,240
bound on

165
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,920
the maximum number of edges that a graph

166
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,920
can have if it doesn't have a large

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,880
click and furthermore this bound here is

168
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,880
best is best possible in the following

169
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,519
sense and here let us restrict to the

170
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,720
case when n is divisible by R when n's

171
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,200
not divisible by R you need to do uh a

172
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,000
similar construction turns out to be

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,800
best possible and this bound is uh can

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,959
be improved slightly but not by too

175
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,320
much so here's the here's the example

176
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,560
let us take the N vertices and split

177
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,279
them

178
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,279
into equal

179
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:31,760
parts and there R parts so here in this

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
illustration r equal to

181
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,680
three and let's putting all the edges

182
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,800
between

183
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,519
Parts but no Edge within the part so

184
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,519
this is called the

185
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
complete R partite

186
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,279
graph so you see that this graph here

187
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,519
one can do a quick calculation to see

188
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,560
that it has exactly this number 1 - 1 /

189
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,360
R * n^ s over two

190
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,839
edges on the other hand it does not

191
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,360
contain a click on more than R vertices

192
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,800
the biggest click you have comes from

193
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,800
taking one vertex in each

194
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,240
part so this is an example showing that

195
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,240
the statement of Turon theorem is best

196
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,560
possible let us prove Ton's theorem as a

197
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:31,079
quick corollary of the earlier

198
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,079
result so by the earlier

199
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,560
corollary

200
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,560
G has a

201
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:50,480
click of size at least the sum over the

202
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,880
vertices in

203
00:12:50,480 --> 00:13:01,440
G one over n minus the degree of v and

204
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,440
here let us use the

205
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:10,000
convexity so in this step let us use the

206
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,360
convexity of the function sending X to 1

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,040
/ n minus X so this is a convex function

208
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,760
which allows us to lower bound the sum

209
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,920
by n Over N minus the average

210
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,920
degree of

211
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,959
G on the other hand if the graph has

212
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,240
more than this many edges then the

213
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,040
average degree is bigger than some

214
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,560
corresponding quantity and putting this

215
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,560
into the expression we can strict have a

216
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:52,399
final expression is strictly bigger than

217
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:54,959
n Over N - 1 - 1 / R * n and this

218
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,480
quantity here equals to

219
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,160
R okay so there's a strict equality sign

220
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,720
here in particular G has a click of size

221
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,199
strictly greater than R and that

222
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,199
finishes the proof of Ton's

223
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,759
theorem tons theorem is a important

224
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,839
foundational result in graph Theory and

225
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,519
it's a start of a subject that we now

226
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,639
call extremal graph Theory

227
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,079
concerning what can you say about a

228
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,959
graph that has certain properties like

229
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,199
not having a large click and this Pro

230
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,560
that we just saw is a beautiful

231
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,360
illustration of the probabilistic method

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,560
two graph theory that allows us to prove

233
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,839
this wonderful result tons theorem along

234
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,600
with many other results that I hope that

235
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,600
you'll learn in the future
