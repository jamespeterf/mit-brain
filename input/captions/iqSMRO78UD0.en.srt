1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,760
okay so let's start uh thank you

2
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,320
everyone for coming uh this is going to

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,720
be a advanced class on cryptography

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,840
those who do not have background on

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,920
cryptography it's okay it's not actually

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,920
hardcore cryptography this is actually a

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
class on the evolution of proofs in

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,000
computer science so this class is really

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,040
about proofs uh that's what we're going

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,879
to learn and kind of how kind of proofs

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,079
evolved with the years starting from

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,480
kind of the 80s mid 80s all the way to

13
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,000
today and how we think about proofs

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,600
differently today so this is uh what

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,079
this class is about actually before I I

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,039
go into kind of the content of the class

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,320
and what what I'm going to be teaching

18
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,039
first of all quick question how many

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,680
students here are not MIT students but

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,239
cross register students okay h a bunch

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,159
so you guys have access so I hope I made

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,400
the the website public it's on canvas uh

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,080
but now I think it should be public so

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,880
uh you know you should have access if

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,560
anyone has problems with accessing the

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,920
website just let me know I'll try to fix

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,079
it um so this class is meeting once a

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,680
week weekly from 1: to 4: p.m. uh in

29
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,360
terms of expectations or what uh so you

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,720
know the expectations that you'll enjoy

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
it I hope you will I think it's really

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,119
really beautiful material uh but beyond

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,799
having fun uh I want to ask uh I have uh

34
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,799
two uh kind of uh requirements from you

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,040
guys so one I want to have scribe notes

36
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,079
for the classes uh I I have written

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,880
notes I can give it to you uh to help

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:52,520
you out but uh so we have about actually

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,759
we we have 11 classes total in in this

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,039
class but uh we're going to have a bunch

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,680
of uh like one one day we're going to

42
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:05,280
have a guest lecture uh by odv who's in

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
he has a beautiful result he's going to

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,800
come here uh on October 6 and presented

45
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,480
to us so uh we won't H that won't need

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,560
to be described and then there one day

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,640
there's a crypto day which also won't

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
need to be described well uh there's

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,560
more anybody wants to

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,599
sit uh but for the rest we'll need

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,519
scribe notes I'm happy if you want to do

52
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,640
it in pairs uh to describe unless will

53
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,800
run out of people and then we'll need to

54
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,879
keep it for one uh so that's one

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,440
requirement and then I was told that I

56
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,599
need to do something more you know

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,560
that's not enough so we'll do a p set

58
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,760
sometime in the middle of the course

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,239
okay uh it won't be anything too

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,319
difficult it's mainly to make sure

61
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,560
you're on board uh but I really do

62
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,920
recommend that before class every time

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,920
before so here's a real homework okay uh

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,840
every time before you come to class in

65
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,799
the website there's reading I really

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,519
recommend you look at the reading and

67
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:10,319
try to read I so there's beautiful uh

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,840
survey by Justin Taylor uh there's a

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,280
link uh on the website uh the survey is

70
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
on proof system it's more of kind of the

71
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,560
applied side of proof system this is a

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,920
more Theory class but he does have

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,280
really beautifully written sections that

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:30,200
are very theoretical that I'm going to

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,040
link to uh so I recommend or I you can

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,760
think of it as informal homework before

77
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,480
class to do the reading I think it will

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,879
be very helpful to uh for understanding

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,879
this class and also after the you know

80
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,480
the lecture to look at the reading and I

81
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,319
think it'll be very very

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,560
helpful okay so uh any questions about

83
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,599
bureaucracy

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
stuff okay so let me tell you a little

85
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,840
bit more about about what the class is

86
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,200
actually about so you know proofs is

87
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,959
something that has been studied in

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,519
mathematics for thousands of years uh

89
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,760
and usually when people think about what

90
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,760
a proof is uh you know a proof you write

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
kind of line by line and you can verify

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
it kind of line by line to make sure the

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,040
proof is correct that's how you know

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,840
most people think of what a proof is

95
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,400
okay starting from the mid 80s in

96
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,560
computer science and particular Le in

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,280
cryptography the way we thought about

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,080
proofs changed started changing this is

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,840
uh came uh about because of the idea of

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,360
zero knowledge proof so there was a hope

101
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,400
to kind of construct proofs that reveal

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,600
no information about why the claim is

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:41,160
true and uh in around 85 uh godas M and

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,160
roov kind of constructed the first zero

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,759
knowledge proof by the way this class is

106
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,400
not about zero knowledge actually it's

107
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,720
not about crypto per se it's just about

108
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,759
kind of coming up with new proof systems

109
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,520
you have a

110
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,720
question um but they constructed they

111
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,800
want to construct these proofs that

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
reveal no information and to do that

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,360
they needed to change the model turns

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,240
out they could not do it using kind of

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,199
what we think of a classical proof and

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,080
the way they changed the model is by

117
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,080
defining a new uh proof system a new

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,440
model uh which is called interactive

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,560
proofs we're going to talk about this

120
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,400
today okay but they Define this notion

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,680
of interactive proof so the we're going

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,240
to start this course by talking about

123
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,440
what interactive proofs are okay uh and

124
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,280
we're going to construct interactive

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,199
proofs in the 80s and 90s when people

126
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,759
thought about interactive proofs usually

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,000
the model is we think of the verifier as

128
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,199
being efficient for us efficient means

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,199
polinomial time okay but of course uh

130
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,800
you know in practice it has more

131
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,120
specific meaning but for now think of

132
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,039
efficient as being pomal time and the

133
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,440
verifier can be all powerful so the the

134
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,440
time complexity of the prover was not

135
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,240
even a consideration actually they

136
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,240
called the prover Merlin like he's a

137
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,759
wizard can do whatever the hell he wants

138
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,720
like in infinite

139
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,880
power what we're going to talk about

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,080
about after introducing this model and

141
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,280
giving some protocols we're going to

142
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,400
talk about the model of doubly efficient

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,039
interactive proofs and here what we we

144
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,440
say no the appr is not all powerful we

145
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,800
don't have all powerful machines in the

146
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,039
world every machine is bounded so what

147
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,400
we want yes the verifier should be very

148
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,919
efficient but the Prov should not be all

149
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,479
powerful either so we care about the

150
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,919
Prov running time too that's what called

151
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
double efficient interactive proofs

152
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,639
we're going to construct double

153
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,400
efficient interactive proof uh we're

154
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,639
going to show the GK protocol specific

155
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,840
protocol and then we're going to show

156
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,199
application of this protocol and we're

157
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,919
going to see application to really nice

158
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,280
kind of models such that PCP which is

159
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,560
probabilistically checkable proofs nip

160
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,120
multi prooof interactive proofs and

161
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,680
particular we're going to show how to

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,599
use this to get a a kind of we proove a

163
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,599
celebrated result which is the IP equals

164
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,440
ppace theorem of Shamir okay so this if

165
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,000
you don't know any of these buzzwords

166
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,759
I'll explain everything this is I'm just

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,720
kind of doing a very quick overview for

168
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,680
those who kind of heard these buzzwords

169
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,319
a little bit and so you'll know what to

170
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,120
expect okay so up to here no crypto at

171
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:13,319
all this is not at all about crypto it's

172
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,199
just about proof systems then we're

173
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,639
going to show how to use cryptography to

174
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,800
get our proofs more succinct okay and

175
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,280
then we're going to kind of uh leave the

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,639
idea the stand the classical idea of a

177
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,319
proof that if the theorem is false there

178
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,400
you can't cheat it's possible to cheat

179
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,280
like there's no fake proof there's no

180
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,840
false proof okay every there's no if the

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,440
theorem is incorrect there's no proof

182
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,120
period we're going to use crypto to say

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,240
ah maybe they're false proof but they're

184
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,639
very hard to find so the only way you

185
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,599
can find a convincing proof to a false

186
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,720
statement is by breaking kind of a hard

187
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,400
uh cryptographic problem you can Factor

188
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,360
large numbers you can break latus

189
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,520
assumptions and so on okay so we're

190
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,800
going to use a cryptography to make our

191
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,199
proofs more succinct but then what what

192
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,879
going on here is are proofs who can make

193
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,000
them succinct but they're still

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,280
interactive and then we're going to show

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,080
how to use this beautiful F Cham

196
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
Paradigm which is a paradigm for

197
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,479
reducing interaction and we're going to

198
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,680
kind of study the security of this

199
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,039
Paradigm and show how to make this

200
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,919
Paradigm secure okay so these are kind

201
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,520
of results that have happened very

202
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,720
recently actually one of the students

203
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,720
here Alex Lombardi at MIT uh was V not

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,599
student was uh one of the people who

205
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
came show kind of the security of this

206
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,360
Paradigm so we're going show it we're

207
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,159
going to use it then to show how to get

208
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,640
our doubly efficient interactive proof

209
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,640
how to make it non interactive anymore

210
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,560
so make it completely

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,080
non-interactive we're going to also show

212
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,760
to use this fimir Paradigm to do kind of

213
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,560
batch proofs uh non-interactively in

214
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,720
very succinct way so taking a bunch of

215
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,440
claims and kind of giving one uh short

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,040
proof from them and finally we're going

217
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,200
to show how to use that to go all the

218
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,880
way to what's called a snar which is a

219
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,839
succinct non-interactive argument

220
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,680
argument is just another word for a

221
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,920
computationally soundproof so this is

222
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,880
kind of very very high level of what you

223
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,480
should expect uh uh to learn in this

224
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,440
class if you didn't understand a word

225
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,000
what I said then this is what the hope

226
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,720
the goal is that you will understand

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,040
this by the end of this

228
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:25,760
class okay uh questions before I start

229
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,040
okay I need a volunteer to scribe for

230
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,120
today oh fantastic thanks okay so with

231
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,720
that let let's start so let's start with

232
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,040
the notion of of interactive proofs and

233
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,440
before I go to interactive proofs let me

234
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,560
just you know even before intive proofs

235
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,320
let's look at the class NP

236
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,800
non-deterministic pomal time even this

237
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,000
class is about proof system right so

238
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:53,200
what is this this class is trying

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,959
to by the way there's another chair here

240
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,440
for those who don't have a chair there's

241
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,440
one right here

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
great great so even before we go to the

243
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
interactive setting let's even think of

244
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,279
the class NP what is the class NP if you

245
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:16,079
think about it it's all the

246
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,279
languages that have a proof that's the

247
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,360
witness that can be verified by

248
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,800
polinomial time okay so we want to think

249
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,720
with the here's the the framework for

250
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,279
this class is the following we want to

251
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,200
ask I we have the verifiers are pomal

252
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,440
time or even like there there you know

253
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,959
they're very efficient what can you

254
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,360
prove to these

255
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:40,360
verifiers okay so that's exactly what NP

256
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,200
captures NP is all the

257
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,360
languages that you can prove membership

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:51,079
in the language to pomal time

259
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:54,279
verifier okay so NP is exactly the

260
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,279
set of

261
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,240
languages m

262
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
ship can be

263
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:18,120
proved in poly time so for or can

264
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,920
prove or can prove to a PO time maybe I

265
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:27,160
should say can proved

266
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,160
to a polinomial Time

267
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,040
verifier so uh poal time verifier can

268
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:39,160
verify membership in the language so far

269
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,720
so good okay but NP is not that rich

270
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,920
okay so we want more more than NP okay

271
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,920
so let's so okay so one thing we can add

272
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,680
so what is the class IP the first thing

273
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,680
that so IP interactive proofs and two

274
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,079
components so in NP the proof is

275
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,200
classical it's the class of languages

276
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,360
for which a membership can be proved

277
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,040
using a classical

278
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,160
proof okay like a proof that you know

279
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,720
you can verify just like running a

280
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,399
touring machine okay interactive proofs

281
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,040
are different in two ways first of all

282
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,040
we

283
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,000
allow

284
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,519
interaction between the prover and the

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,360
verifier they can talk back and

286
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,160
forth

287
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,160
importantly we allow

288
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,320
randomization now note what do I mean

289
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,160
randomization the verifier can be

290
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,160
randomized and there can be some chance

291
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,320
that the theorem is uh false and he'll

292
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,920
accept but that's very very small okay

293
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,600
we can make it kind of if the

294
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,600
communication complexity is let's say n

295
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,279
we can make you'll you'll accept the

296
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,440
false statement probability something

297
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,880
like 2 Theus n so we can make it very

298
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,880
very small but there is a nonzero chance

299
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,639
that you'll accept false statement okay

300
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,760
so in that sense we weakened the

301
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:12,399
model now note if there's no

302
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,079
randomization if we force the

303
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,240
verifier to be deterministic if the

304
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,000
interaction so again the interactive

305
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,160
proof is a kind of

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,920
interactive protocol between approver

307
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,240
and verifier if the approver knew what

308
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,839
the verifier is going to send if he was

309
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,560
completely

310
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,360
deterministic then the pro can just

311
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,199
generate the entire transcript and give

312
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,079
it as a proof so it will really be

313
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:40,000
NP there's no point of this

314
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,079
interaction so really the power of this

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
IP comes from the fact that the verifier

316
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,959
is interacted it comes from the fact

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,959
that the verifier is interactive is is

318
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,680
randomized sorry is randomized and the

319
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,040
pro doesn't know what this Randomness is

320
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,160
going to be so if I'm trying to prove to

321
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,560
you a

322
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,079
statement I send you my first message I

323
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,759
don't know what question you're going to

324
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,399
ask me you're going answer some random

325
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,160
questions and I'll need to give an

326
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,560
answer and then I don't know what the

327
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,920
next question if I knew all your

328
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,639
question in advance then there's no

329
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,839
point it's like it loses the power okay

330
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,560
so really the power comes from the fact

331
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,800
that there's interraction in the PO

332
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,759
cannot predict ahead of time what

333
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,240
questions he's going to get from the

334
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,240
verifier okay so any any

335
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,480
questions Okay so

336
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
I can I did Define this formul yet I'll

337
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,800
Define it formally in a bit but I hope I

338
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,839
convinced you that like without

339
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,199
Randomness this model is really useless

340
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,680
okay there's no point how about just how

341
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,600
about without inaction let's say I had

342
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,880
only

343
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,360
Randomness do I get more and actually so

344
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,279
what what if we allow only

345
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,079
Randomness so

346
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,959
proofs so let's talk about

347
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,959
non-interactive proofs

348
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,759
where the verifier V is

349
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,279
randomized by the way I forgot to say

350
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,079
please stop me at any point and ask me

351
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,160
questions I like questions questions are

352
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,519
good for me to kind of SL me down it

353
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,639
gives you an opportunity to digest so

354
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,560
it's a great thing so please just at any

355
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,560
point stop me with questions

356
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,920
questions okay so uh good so what what

357
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,920
about if we so we said if we get rid of

358
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,519
Randomness we get nothing what if we get

359
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,519
rid of interaction and we just allow

360
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,079
Randomness do we get more and actually

361
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,560
we do get more okay and actually this

362
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:52,360
complexity test is a name this is ma for

363
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,519
Merlin Arthur Arthur is known as a

364
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,040
verify Merin is known as aover so kind

365
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:59,120
of the approver sends a message Arthur

366
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,279
the verifier can kind of toss coins and

367
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,120
based on that decide if to accept or not

368
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,800
but anyway the non the non-interactive

369
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,560
randomized version is uh believe to be I

370
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,240
mean it may be more powerful than NP we

371
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,160
actually don't know but it seems there's

372
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,680
some more power and actually let me give

373
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,680
you an example this is example that will

374
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,720
kind of be useful for us later so it's

375
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,720
not only an example but let me give you

376
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,440
an example where kind of Randomness can

377
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,399
be helpful for us okay so suppose you

378
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,000
want to

379
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:34,480
verify let's say you have two n byn

380
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,480
matrices A and B these are n byn

381
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,199
matrices let's say over Z1 or over a

382
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
finite

383
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,800
field and let's say you want to verify

384
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,040
suppose you want to

385
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,120
verify that some Matrix C is equal to a

386
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,199
*

387
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,120
B so you're also given let's say

388
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,520
C you want to so you you need to verify

389
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,199
task of matrix

390
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,959
multiplication okay we can do it

391
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,280
efficiently in general the best known

392
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,760
algorithm is something like order uh o

393
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,880
of n to the 2 3 6 maybe something like

394
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,640
that that's the best known matrix

395
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,600
multiplication

396
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:27,640
algorithm why you looking me the number

397
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,559
yeah close uh let but turns out that if

398
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,000
using randomization

399
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,679
you can do it more efficiently okay so

400
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,120
let's show how you can verify that a

401
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,360
matrix C is a product of two matrices A

402
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,799
and B in time order and

403
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,919
squared okay so kind of the best you can

404
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,520
do because you need to read the the

405
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,360
input okay so how will you do that

406
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,360
here's the idea so here's a

407
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,960
randomized algorithm for verifying this

408
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,280
so let's assume that F first assume this

409
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,280
is kind of without lots of

410
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,440
generality that f is much bigger than

411
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,840
n if not you can take kind of an

412
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,799
extension field of that okay embedded in

413
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,559
a much bigger field so just let's assume

414
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,360
if those who are not kind of comfortable

415
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,280
with extension field let's assume it's

416
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,960
just much

417
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,280
bigger okay then what do you do here's

418
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,559
my algorithm what I'm going to do I'm

419
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,559
going to choose a random element in the

420
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:44,480
field I'm going to consider X which is

421
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:47,240
just uh 1 r r 2 up to R to the N minus

422
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,520
one okay so all the powers of R I chose

423
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,640
a random R in the field I look at all

424
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,440
the powers of

425
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,440
R and then what do I

426
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,039
do yeah

427
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:08,400
exactly and then I'm going to

428
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:12,320
check if C * X I guess

429
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:16,600
transpose because I wrote it is equal to

430
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,600
a b *

431
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,760
X that's my

432
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,320
algorithm okay so note

433
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,000
uh yeah

434
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,520
so so note this is just a vector and

435
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,159
Vector times Matrix mult so to multiply

436
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:40,200
a matrix by Vector is time n squ as

437
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:43,360
opposed to you know the N to the 23 six

438
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,280
so this is more efficient why is it okay

439
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,440
why why so of course it's complete if

440
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,000
these are equal I'm going to accept Okay

441
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,159
but if they're not

442
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,559
equal so so why why is it uh sound so

443
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,200
maybe you can convince me let's say

444
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,240
they're not equal maybe you can still

445
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,640
convince me that they're equal that

446
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
would be a problem

447
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,880
so let

448
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:14,679
yeah the size of the field iser than n

449
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,240
it's that like fantastic fantastic so

450
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,240
here's let me just repeat what you said

451
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,480
a b bit more formly so suppose they're

452
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,039
not equal there's one row that they're

453
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,320
not equal on right let's focus on that

454
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,840
row so you can think of what when I do c

455
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,640
* X let's let's say C1 like the first

456
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:37,720
row of C when I do c *

457
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:41,600
X this is you can think of this as I

458
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,240
take I look at this the row as a polom

459
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,919
so if you look at the first row maybe

460
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:52,080
I'll write it as C11 up to or C10 up to

461
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,799
C1 n minus one okay let's look at this n

462
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:00,400
row when I multiply by X which is one r

463
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:04,840
r squ this is nothing but some C 1 i x

464
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,840
to the I or sorry R to the

465
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:14,080
I so now what do I check so now you know

466
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,799
if this row let's say it is different

467
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,960
than the row

468
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:22,080
here then I have two different

469
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,120
pols right so if I write if I write the

470
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,919
row there let's say as I don't know D1

471
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:33,000
d0 or d10 up to D1 n minus one let's say

472
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:37,760
this is the row corresponding to a *

473
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,880
B if these are different if these are

474
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,840
different then I have two different

475
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,520
pols that agree in a random out two

476
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:51,799
random degree n minus one pols so the

477
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,400
polinomial is defined by this row these

478
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,880
are the coefficients of the polinomial

479
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,279
they're n coefficient so it's a degree n

480
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,400
minus one polom so

481
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,080
when when would I S when would I accept

482
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,279
a false claim if there exist two things

483
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,760
that are equal that are different to

484
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,159
there exists a row in in C that's

485
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,039
different than a row in a *

486
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,880
B so there exists a polinomial degree in

487
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,080
minus one here and a different

488
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:23,600
polinomial degree and minus one and

489
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,600
these two pols are equal and this

490
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,200
are but what is the probability that two

491
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,000
distinct polinomial of degree n minus

492
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,000
one are equal it's just this happens

493
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,440
with

494
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,400
probability at most n minus one the

495
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,799
degree divided by the field

496
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,760
sides right two pooms agree two distinct

497
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,080
pols agree on at most or the fraction

498
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,880
not they agree on at most n minus one

499
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,679
points and which is nus one over F

500
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,960
fraction of

501
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,600
the of the field

502
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,640
so so that so I'll I'll reject with this

503
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,720
probability and if we're not happy with

504
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,960
this F is f is not big enough for us

505
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,159
then we do everything over a bigger

506
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,200
extension field so we can except so our

507
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:14,760
rejection probability will be uh high if

508
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,159
if if the claims

509
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,919
Falls any any questions about

510
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:26,960
this okay so so far what we saw is that

511
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:30,600
when oh yeah oh yes please thank you

512
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,799
is this is not short zipa short zipa is

513
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,640
similar but in a multivariant setting so

514
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,520
this good so let me that's a good

515
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,360
question so thank you so uh I just want

516
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,480
to say oh by the way I should tell you

517
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,000
guys this this uh this is being recorded

518
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,760
I hope it's okay with you you're not

519
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,960
being recorded it's supposed I'm

520
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,520
supposed to be the one being recorded

521
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,159
but I think you should know that there's

522
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,600
a cameraman behind you uh but actually I

523
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,039
don't I don't think I'm going to put

524
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,799
this public I mean it's in the website

525
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,440
for us well now the website is public so

526
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,440
it will be public

527
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,279
I I can make it private if you prefer if

528
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,320
if people come to me and ask for it to

529
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:11,039
be private I'll make it private um okay

530
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,440
uh so uh good so the question was was

531
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,520
this short zipa and the answer exact

532
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,799
short zipa is a multivariate version of

533
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:23,080
this okay this is for the single variate

534
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:26,399
case so the fact that two univariate

535
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,840
polinomial of degree D distinct they're

536
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:34,480
equal and a random value their equal and

537
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,320
most D element D being the degree uh is

538
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,039
uh is kind of I don't remember theorem

539
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,600
like basic something

540
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,960
M you say interation yeah but CH is

541
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,880
exactly that but the multivariant

542
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,360
setting so a generalization of exactly

543
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,279
exactly the tral is exactly

544
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,799
generalization of this the it will come

545
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,120
up actually later in this class so yeah

546
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,320
we'll talk about that great any other

547
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,320
question

548
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,360
yeah good good good very good question

549
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:14,799
so the question is can are do we have

550
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,000
examples where Randomness gives you more

551
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,679
speed up than just kind of pathetic this

552
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,960
is not very interesting right so or in

553
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,000
other words let me rephrase your

554
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,320
question is the class ma different than

555
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,320
NP that's the question we don't

556
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,520
know so ma said that the

557
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,000
verif yeah so the yeah so all and okay

558
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,520
so yeah so let me explain uh there's a

559
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,320
kind of there's this class called like m

560
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,679
a m a ma a as many as you want and the

561
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,039
idea is m means Merlin speaks mlin is

562
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,480
the approver he's the wizard a means

563
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,799
Arthur the king he's the verifier

564
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,200
answers M speaks a answers M speak a

565
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,760
answers so there's kind of these classes

566
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,640
uh you know Ma a ma ma ma

567
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,960
uh here ma a means M the Merlin speaks

568
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,240
Arthur kind of uses Randomness and then

569
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,240
kind of sends Randomness well he doesn't

570
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,760
speak mlin doesn't speak again so but

571
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,279
Merlin speaks Arthur chooses coins and

572
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,799
then there's a verdict function that

573
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,520
decides to accept or

574
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:22,799
reject okay and we don't know if ma is

575
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:26,039
different than NP yes so this actually

576
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,919
is a you know po identity testing right

577
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,200
right like you saying this is like poom

578
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:35,000
identity yes I give you a circuit

579
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,600
supp I claim

580
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,600
that you can check it

581
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:45,880
clearly right right

582
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:48,039
right right but uh oh you're saying

583
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,480
you're saying sorry you're saying to

584
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:54,360
test whether a circuit is a identically

585
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,600
zero but wait oh you're giving us just

586
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,120
as as a circuit as a circuit testing if

587
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,200
it's identically zero

588
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,640
but if it needs to be low degree because

589
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,399
otherwise so like it's syntactically low

590
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,559
degree right low dep or something right

591
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:13,880
low depth aritic CC low depth like log

592
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,120
log depth arithmetic circuit then you're

593
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,080
saying it has polinomial degree it has

594
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,480
polinomial degree you can test it by

595
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,880
taking a large field it's sent field you

596
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,120
can test you don't know how to predict

597
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,360
if it's yes good we don't know how to D

598
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,159
randomize it how to Der randomize

599
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,919
randomize it then there are circulars

600
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,399
which means you can randomize everything

601
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,919
probably right more

602
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:41,320
less you

603
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,320
get yeah yeah

604
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,399
Al no why why is it n so so you look at

605
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,399
the

606
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,279
CL also right okay okay yeah yeah yeah

607
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,600
yeah yeah you're right it's in BPP

608
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:01,440
yeah so I just wanted to make the point

609
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:06,880
that I describe is essentially the the

610
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:11,200
only canonical problem in okay yeah yeah

611
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,200
up to up to details which I

612
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,039
think thanks thanks yeah okay so uh okay

613
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,039
so now let's go in ahead and just Define

614
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,039
this class of NP

615
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:32,039
uh of of Ip are interactive proofs so

616
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,679
and then we'll show how kind of uh an

617
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:37,559
actual uh to and we'll actually show why

618
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,240
we believe this class is more powerful

619
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:43,760
then NP will give kind of a a protocol

620
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,279
that solves a problem that seems pretty

621
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,919
hard so let's

622
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:52,559
see so here is the so what is an

623
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,559
interactive

624
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,600
proof an interractive proof

625
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,469
IP this is a

626
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,469
[Music]

627
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,559
protocol

628
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:20,120
between and

629
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,120
possibly all powerful okay I'm

630
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,240
not

631
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,720
aover

632
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:35,360
P okay so P can be run as long as he

633
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,360
wants and a poly

634
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,159
time

635
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,799
verifier

636
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:47,200
v such that here's the requirement want

637
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:51,480
from from the protocol we want to say

638
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,360
that a so interactive protocol let's say

639
00:29:51,480 --> 00:30:00,039
for H sorry between a

640
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,039
p for a language l

641
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,120
for some

642
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,039
language or some problem l so the

643
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,200
problem correspondent is membership in L

644
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,919
that's a problem is X a member not a

645
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,039
member so an interactive proof should

646
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,840
satisfy the following so it's a protocol

647
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,399
such that it should have two properties

648
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:26,200
completeness and

649
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:26,200
soundness completeness says

650
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,159
that if x is in the language the PO

651
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:38,200
should convince you to

652
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:41,000
accept Okay so if for every X in the

653
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,880
language if you look if you denote let's

654
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,200
say by T the transcript so let's say

655
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,480
p uh and V which has secret Randomness

656
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,960
the prover doesn't know what it is ahead

657
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:58,159
of time and input X let's run this

658
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,120
protocol we get a transcript

659
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,519
okay so the it's an interactive protocol

660
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,679
it actually think can think of it the

661
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,039
protocol consists in two phases first

662
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,360
there's interaction between the they

663
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:11,159
talk back and forth let's denote the

664
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,720
transcript by T okay often denot like

665
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,240
like PV that's kind of the protocol the

666
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,840
Prov has are both of them know the input

667
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,399
X they generate a transcript and at the

668
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,919
end the

669
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:27,919
probability that V with his input with

670
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:31,159
his uh he gets the transcript the r

671
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,200
Randomness in X the probability that he

672
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:36,080
accepts outputs one when we say output

673
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,440
one we usually mean he

674
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,399
accepts is large okay let me call a

675
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,039
least

676
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:50,039
C so and C is going to be a completeness

677
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:56,240
parameter so a protocol between p and v

678
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:56,240
for language L with completeness

679
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,240
C and

680
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
soundness

681
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,840
S ah yes I do mean all AC now oh thank

682
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,240
you thanks

683
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,320
L okay so if it's in the language he's

684
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,080
accepted with high probability there's

685
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,120
some complet this parameter C and most

686
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,760
of what we see in class that AC is one

687
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,279
okay you accept with probability one and

688
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,279
sist

689
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,279
says

690
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:54,159
this sist says that for any X not in the

691
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,159
language

692
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,399
for every X that's not in the

693
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,240
language no matter how you try to cheat

694
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:14,240
you'll fail okay so for any cheating

695
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,799
prover or for any P star because it can

696
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,799
be any any Prov that tries to convince

697
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,799
me to

698
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,799
accept if we the probability for the

699
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,000
same t as above the probability that the

700
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:32,200
verifier given the transcript the

701
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,840
randomness in X outputs one accepts is

702
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,840
at most

703
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,360
s okay so that's if you if it's in the

704
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,480
language you should be accept with high

705
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,279
probability C is high if it's not in the

706
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,399
language you should accept with small

707
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,720
probability s is

708
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,039
small

709
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,760
okay question about the

710
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,639
model

711
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:59,080
yeah is there any restriction on S and C

712
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:01,919
or they just right great question uh

713
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,559
what are snc are they constant so that

714
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,480
was my next remark which means that the

715
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:08,960
question was right in place uh so often

716
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,000
if you look at the literature there

717
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,359
won't be a mention of s and C and C will

718
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,560
be taken to be 2/3 and that's will be

719
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,399
taken to be one3 that's kind of a

720
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,480
canonical so when people say there's an

721
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:25,839
inter here's an interactive proof often

722
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,440
you think of s as 1/3 and C as 2/3 and

723
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,960
this seems like very arbitrary and you

724
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,399
should be be alarmed so what what you

725
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,440
know where do this PL come

726
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:40,440
from I don't I think it's

727
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
theed

728
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,599
exactly exactly so the reason why we

729
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,839
don't care so much about these constants

730
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,399
is because if you have an interactive

731
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,919
proof with a gap between CNS so for

732
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,800
example 1/3 and 2/3 what we're going to

733
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,839
do is repeat the protocol so let's say

734
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,240
that it's 1/3 and 23 let's repeat the

735
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:04,079
protocol let's say n times and then

736
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,359
we're going to accept if you're closer

737
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:11,640
to C and reject if you're closer to to s

738
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:15,960
or if so in other words if you if more

739
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,160
than C uh plus s over two like right in

740
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,839
the middle if more than C plus s over

741
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,560
two are accepted you're going to accept

742
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,119
if less you're going to reject in in

743
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,280
this case of 2/3 and third if let's say

744
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,440
more than half repeat it many many many

745
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,599
times you should accept if it's in the

746
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,280
language you should expect to see about

747
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,160
two3 acceptance if it's not in the

748
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,560
language you should expect to see one

749
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,440
third of them being accepted and if you

750
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,320
repeat enough times by the laws of large

751
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,760
numbers you're going to kind of get

752
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,480
closer and closer to the expectation so

753
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,599
you're going to be either very close to

754
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,240
the 2/3 if you're in the language or

755
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,599
very close to the one3 if you're outside

756
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:58,640
the language and the the uh like the the

757
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:01,319
there's very strong concentration so if

758
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,359
you repeat it let's say n times then now

759
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:06,280
you're can to be accepted or your the

760
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,000
soundness and uh completeness Gap would

761
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,440
be something like 2 the minus n versus 1

762
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,359
minus 2 the minus n so you can really

763
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,920
kind of uh very fast make these things

764
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:18,160
go to zero and one which is why often we

765
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,599
don't really care about these and you

766
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,960
can think of them very close to zero and

767
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,480
very close to one so if it's in the

768
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,680
language you accept probability almost

769
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,160
one if it's not the language you reject

770
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:33,720
you accept probility almost zero

771
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:37,359
okay great okay any question about kind

772
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:40,400
of what an interactive uh proof

773
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,560
is okay I just want to mention one thing

774
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,359
uh this

775
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,040
notation like PV on input X is

776
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:51,400
overloaded we use this notation to

777
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,560
denote the transcript we also use this

778
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,520
notation to denote the verdict function

779
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,400
whether V accepts or not and also I'll

780
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,400
use that in class and also wherever you

781
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,800
read you'll see both of them kind of

782
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,480
used so it's good to get used to so this

783
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,640
sometimes denotes the entire transcript

784
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,200
sometimes it's just the notes the

785
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,160
acceptance or ejection bit of of the

786
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,319
verifier and it'll be clear in the

787
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:20,200
context okay so now the question you

788
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:22,960
should ask is okay is this uh is this

789
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,480
model more expressive than

790
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:30,119
NP what can we do with this model how

791
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:34,200
can what's the power of this

792
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:39,280
m so let me actually go to the punchline

793
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,280
and say there's a celebrated result by

794
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,040
Shamir from 92 I

795
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,839
believe and he showed ex he oh this

796
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,839
model is very very powerful and actually

797
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:56,920
you can prove any P space computation in

798
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,680
this model namely if I want to prove to

799
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,280
you any language in P space take any

800
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,040
language in P space I can prove

801
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,920
membership in this language to a

802
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:11,280
verifier that only runs in polinomial

803
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:14,160
time so that's sh so b space we believe

804
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,160
is much much kind of more expressive

805
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,400
stronger than NP we actually don't know

806
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,119
how to prove it by the way but we

807
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,160
believe that's the

808
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,839
case uh so we believe this is a much

809
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,240
stronger kind of uh proof

810
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,880
system okay actually before I I'm going

811
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,359
to show you actually now I'm going to

812
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,760
give you an example of the kind of the

813
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,359
power of this proof system but before I

814
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,359
go into kind of the technicality I want

815
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:42,200
to step back for a second and kind of

816
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,079
think a little bit about the story here

817
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,079
which is a very nice story so you know

818
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,160
this introduction of uh interactive

819
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,760
proofs this model came about for the

820
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,640
goal of doing zero knowledge nobody

821
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,160
thought at that point about whether you

822
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,520
can prove more languages not more

823
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,960
languag which is the only thing you want

824
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,920
is to hide okay I just want to hide why

825
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,560
a theorem is true I want to hide the

826
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,240
proof I want to convince you but hide

827
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,839
that was the only goal uh that kind of

828
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,319
introduced this model and it's kind of

829
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,720
interesting how kind of very F like also

830
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,760
who cares about zero knowledge this is a

831
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,520
really interesting model let's see what

832
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,440
we can do with it and this kind of open

833
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,920
our eyes just the idea that we can shift

834
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,520
from the traditional way of thinking

835
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,119
about proofs to this attractive and

836
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,079
randomized randomized land kind of

837
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,359
brought about a lot of really really

838
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,800
beautiful and fascinating results

839
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,040
including the fact this is the first

840
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,319
time to realize wow we can prove a lot

841
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,480
of ver to a polinomial Time verifier

842
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:47,240
much more than what was believed to

843
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,560
be a what we believed we can do with a

844
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,520
classical

845
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,839
proof so this was kind of really I think

846
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:59,040
eye opening and very interesting so okay

847
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:03,960
so now I'm GNA convince you try to

848
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:07,839
convince you of why this

849
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,920
a proof system this model is so powerful

850
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,560
by giving you an example of things of a

851
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,119
problem that I can prove to you using an

852
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,880
interactive proof that we really don't

853
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,280
know how to prove using a classical

854
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,280
proof okay so let me give you the

855
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,280
example

856
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,520
so here's the

857
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,520
example so the protocol is called Su

858
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,119
protocol and this I'm going to give you

859
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,319
an interactive this is an interactive

860
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,599
proof for the following problem so take

861
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,960
any degree

862
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:59,079
fix or okay

863
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,640
given a

864
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:04,040
polinomial

865
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,839
F let's say from F to the N so

866
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,839
multivariate

867
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,359
polinomial of let's take degree D in

868
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,359
each

869
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:28,240
variable okay I want a proof

870
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,760
that sum of f B1

871
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,920
or let me just make sure how do I wrot

872
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,240
it

873
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,640
down okay

874
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,640
sorry so take any fix

875
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,160
any subset h and

876
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,160
f you can think of H 01 you can think of

877
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,079
a bigger

878
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:58,319
set I want to I want you to convince me

879
00:41:52,079 --> 00:42:01,280
that Su F of H1 up to hm

880
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,640
for all H1 up to

881
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,839
hm in

882
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,839
h is equals some value

883
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,200
beta okay so there's a fixed polinomial

884
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,839
F let's say I know this polinomial I

885
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,119
either it actually has a succinct

886
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,240
circuit or maybe I have Oracle access to

887
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,200
it so I'm a

888
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,119
verifier I'm a verifier I have let's say

889
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,079
I have Oracle access to this polinomial

890
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,440
or there are some sync way to compute it

891
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,160
so I can compute this polinomial easily

892
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,800
let's think for now I have Oracle access

893
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,319
to it so I can kind of query it in some

894
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,319
point and after that and get back an

895
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,920
answer I want you to I want prove you

896
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:49,920
you're going to prove to me that the sum

897
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,359
of this polinomial and H to the m points

898
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,200
and all the points there some set H you

899
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:57,680
can think of H as 01 you can think of it

900
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:01,319
bigger and I want you to sum this iial

901
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,800
on all the elements in the set H to the

902
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:05,640
N okay all of this is done over some

903
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,040
finite field

904
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:12,079
F and there's a result beta I want to

905
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,079
prove that this sum is

906
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,119
beta okay that's that's I I'm going to

907
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:20,960
show you an interactive proof for this

908
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,520
langage now before kind of you guys are

909
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,200
like seriously why do I care about this

910
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,000
language is it interesting where did I

911
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,680
come up with this thing let me tell you

912
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,599
I think this is

913
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,760
the most important protocol in all the

914
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,359
literature and pro systems okay we all

915
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,359
use this protocol all the time it turns

916
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:39,359
out to be super super influential okay

917
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,079
every single thing we'll use from now on

918
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,599
relies on this protocol okay so it turns

919
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,480
out and I'm going to convince you that

920
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,280
later uh but that this is a very very

921
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,720
important actually problem okay if you

922
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,000
have interactive proof for this problem

923
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,920
you it kind of gives you rise attrative

924
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,599
proof for many many many other

925
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,000
problems okay actually we use this if

926
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,559
you give me an interactive proof for

927
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,160
this problem I can use it to get an

928
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:08,720
interactive proof for all P

929
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:12,079
space in kind of a blackbox way so

930
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,800
really this is the heart of coming up

931
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,960
with interactive proofs this is the most

932
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,599
important interactive

933
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,800
proof okay so with that let me show you

934
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:27,960
the interactive proof for proving

935
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:32,040
this okay any questions before we jump

936
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:34,480
yeah just H is like one

937
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,200
dimension exactly H exactly you can

938
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,720
think of H is 01 for example you can

939
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,480
think of H 012 yeah I mean if two is in

940
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,319
the field yeah it's a onedimensional

941
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,800
thing right and you sum over so as a the

942
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,559
you sum here over H to the m sides of H

943
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,559
to the m elements

944
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,839
uh it can be you sum over all of them

945
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:05,800
you sum over also like z z z z z one

946
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,720
yeah all yeah H one and each2 do not

947
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,000
need to be distinct at all yeah exactly

948
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,920
over all possible yeah you Su over H to

949
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,040
the m elements each one all all the

950
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:20,079
possibilities good other

951
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,960
questions thank you yes so degree D in

952
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,800
each variable just means like any

953
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,920
variable is exp exactly so yeah let me

954
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,440
good good great so degree D in each

955
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,040
variable means f is a polinomial so you

956
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:37,280
can write it as a sum of monomials each

957
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,960
monomial each uh H variable has a degree

958
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,319
so I want say if you look at all the

959
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,599
monomials each variable has a degree and

960
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:46,920
most be in each of the

961
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:49,440
monomials okay great questions thank you

962
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,440
any other

963
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,319
questions okay great so let me give you

964
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,640
uh the protocol a

965
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,640
so let's do

966
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:10,119
it by the way I want to tell you I get

967
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,839
such satisfactions from your questions

968
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:14,160
so if you just want to make me happy

969
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,640
which is a great goal on its own and you

970
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,640
should ask

971
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,880
questions okay

972
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,119
ready for the protocol okay Pro

973
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:42,760
convinces a

974
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:45,240
verifier that the sum F on H1 up to

975
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,160
hn is equal to

976
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:52,000
Beta where the H is are all elements in

977
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,800
this set H which is in the field we have

978
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,520
some fixed field that we're looking over

979
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,079
okay how would he prove what would what

980
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,480
would he do so here is the idea the idea

981
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:06,680
is the prover will first

982
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:10,680
send this sum this polinomial but where

983
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:12,960
the first variable is EMP is open so he

984
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,960
will

985
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,960
compute he will compute some only over

986
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:27,680
H2 up to

987
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:30,640
hm f of x this is a variable H2 up to hn

988
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,599
and he will send this over let's call

989
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:38,079
this G1 of

990
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:42,440
X so he sends a univariate

991
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:47,359
polinomial okay where he sums over H2 to

992
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:52,440
hm but leaves the first variable

993
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,440
open okay what is the degree of this

994
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,480
polinomial D very good so this is a

995
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,839
degree d

996
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,839
polinomial the verifier

997
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,520
checks that G1 is of

998
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:15,280
degree at most D if not he rejects

999
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,200
because he knows that this is a degree D

1000
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,359
polinomial multivaried

1001
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,000
polinomial so he knows that each

1002
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:25,040
variable is the degree most D so if you

1003
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,400
s something degree like you're cheating

1004
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:31,359
here so it's going to be reject

1005
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,839
you he he will also

1006
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,839
check that

1007
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:45,559
some G1 of H I guess one let me call

1008
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:49,760
H1 that if you take G1 and you sum it

1009
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,760
over all possible H's in

1010
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,799
h what does he expect to get what would

1011
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,319
he check

1012
00:48:54,799 --> 00:49:00,319
for exactly beta

1013
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:02,880
because the claim is beta so he checks

1014
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:06,119
that this is a degree

1015
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,400
mosd that when you sun over hes you get

1016
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,400
what was

1017
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,480
claimed okay if he's if this does not

1018
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:18,240
hold then he reject he say b i reject

1019
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,079
you not going to continue if this holds

1020
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,240
then he chooses a

1021
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,720
random T1 in the

1022
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,200
field this is often a notation left

1023
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,599
arrow that we use for choosing a random

1024
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,400
okay so he uses a he chooses a random a

1025
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,799
T1 a random element in the field not an

1026
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,319
H but in The Big Field okay you need to

1027
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:41,480
think of this field as being big well

1028
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,480
that will the bigger the field the

1029
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,440
better the soundless will

1030
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,559
get okay so he chooses a random T1 in

1031
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,559
the

1032
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:56,520
field good then what happens the the PO

1033
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:05,880
in some sense this reduces the problem

1034
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:08,400
from checking that this sum is beta to

1035
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,400
checking

1036
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:17,280
sum let me WR here to checking that sum

1037
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,319
of f t t is fixed or T1 you call it and

1038
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:25,079
then H2 up to

1039
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:28,880
hn is this fixed I don't know G1 of

1040
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:31,480
T1 we kind of reduce the problem to this

1041
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:36,200
problem which is of one dimension less

1042
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:39,200
because the sum is only over M minus one

1043
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,200
variables

1044
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,480
yes good what what are we going to put

1045
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,839
polinomial in very good question when I

1046
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,160
said that verifier is polinomial time

1047
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:54,559
polinomial in what so he's going to he's

1048
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:57,079
going to be polinomial okay we think of

1049
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,599
F I said f can be as Oracle axis to it

1050
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:02,240
so what poom what so he was he what

1051
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,720
we're we're going to analyze his runtime

1052
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,680
in a bit but his runtime will depend

1053
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:11,960
polinomial on M which is the number of

1054
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:16,640
variables and on the

1055
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:19,640
degree and we think of a in these in to

1056
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,160
today and act like throughout the course

1057
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:25,240
and it's common in this field we think

1058
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,000
of f like that he can add and multiply

1059
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:30,920
things in or order one time like it's a

1060
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,400
constant uh and typically these fields

1061
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,160
are going to be take polylog but we

1062
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,119
don't want to run you know chase after

1063
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,799
these polog terms so we're not going to

1064
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,240
consider them really sometimes we do

1065
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:43,119
sometimes we don't depends but beyond

1066
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,799
the so if you want to be kind of very

1067
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,680
pedantic then

1068
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:50,799
you log

1069
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:55,079
F also H maybe yes thank

1070
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:57,680
you yes of course thanks sua the size of

1071
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,799
H and log

1072
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,640
F that's what's going to happen but you

1073
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:04,000
right that here the polinomial time

1074
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,960
doesn't really apply here because you I

1075
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,319
said that he has oralis so we polinomial

1076
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,480
over so this is this is what he's going

1077
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:11,920
to be after but when we're going to use

1078
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,720
him for applications you'll see it will

1079
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,480
correspond to polinomial time but we're

1080
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,119
going to go over this uh when when uh

1081
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,720
when we analyze the

1082
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:24,000
protocol okay so let's uh okay so let's

1083
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,760
just uh uh continue so where let me

1084
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,480
actually start it so what's let me even

1085
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,839
say before I continue the protocol let's

1086
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,319
continue the protocol with kind of a

1087
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,599
high level idea of what we're trying to

1088
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:36,319
do here the idea is the

1089
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,760
following we want to catch aover

1090
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,040
cheating that's the goal of a proof

1091
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,280
right we want to catch you if you're

1092
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:45,319
cheating so suppose aover is cheating

1093
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,200
here how will how will he C we catch it

1094
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:50,280
the way we're going to catch it is when

1095
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,599
tell you know what give me this

1096
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:58,040
G1 okay now he cannot give me an the

1097
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:01,559
actual true G1 Because the actual true

1098
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:05,160
G1 will not sum up to Beta beta is the

1099
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:07,799
false thing so right so if it if a po

1100
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,480
cheats if he try let I'm trying to kind

1101
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:11,839
of let's come up with this protocol

1102
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:15,640
together with kind of the goal of trying

1103
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:18,480
to catch the the approver so how do we

1104
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,760
catch aover cheating so the IDE is will

1105
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,200
tell me you know what give me this some

1106
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,839
with this

1107
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,880
open I'm going to check that this sum

1108
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,079
with like that the sum of G1 is equal to

1109
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:33,960
Beta and then it's low

1110
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,040
degree if it passes then this G1 cannot

1111
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,520
be the true true G1 it can't actually be

1112
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,599
the real sum of f because the real sum

1113
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,160
of f is not beta he's cheating so this

1114
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:46,160
must be a

1115
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,160
cheat now when we send in

1116
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:55,200
T1 and we consider kind of so now we

1117
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:57,680
send T1 and we kind of reduce the claim

1118
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,920
to claiming this

1119
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,200
but with very high probability G1 is

1120
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:07,599
also a cheat

1121
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:10,119
because G1 G1 T1 is a cheat so G1 T1 is

1122
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,440
not really the sum because they're

1123
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:14,960
different G1 is different than that so

1124
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,119
we know that if they're different they

1125
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,559
agree only on D elements okay two

1126
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,119
distinct polom age only on D elements

1127
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,640
what's the probability that this1 is one

1128
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:28,079
of the D very small

1129
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,400
DF Okay so think of is really large

1130
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,319
great so this is also false actually you

1131
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,599
know he give me G one it's actually not

1132
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,559
the real life he's going to claim it's

1133
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,079
the real life but I know it's not now

1134
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:43,200
I'm going to tell him next thing I'm

1135
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:45,079
going to tell him okay give me G2 G2 is

1136
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:50,920
G2 of

1137
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:57,559
X is some it should be some f T1 I'm

1138
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:57,559
going to only sum over H3 up to hm

1139
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:03,599
the X2 the two is going to be open and

1140
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:03,599
then H3 after

1141
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,920
H okay so we started by getting rid of

1142
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:13,319
the summing over

1143
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:16,200
H1 we gave him the univ pomal or we

1144
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:18,880
chose our R T1 now we're getting rid of

1145
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,240
summing over the second

1146
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:27,240
coordinate we're asking for a univ

1147
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:30,319
polinomial G2 what do we check we check

1148
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:33,280
so the verifier checks that

1149
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:39,319
G2 is of

1150
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,319
degree and most D and what else does he

1151
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:57,920
check very good so sum G2 and

1152
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:57,920
H maybe I'll write H2 is equal to what

1153
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:07,839
exactly G1 of

1154
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:11,599
T1 so essentially we kind of you know we

1155
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,599
check this for exactly as we did

1156
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:19,839
before okay so now note if in the honest

1157
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,680
case of course that's that's the case G2

1158
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,640
of course is degree at most D because f

1159
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:27,599
is degree at most D and when you sum

1160
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,960
with over over all of H2 you should get

1161
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,880
exactly G1 and T that's how

1162
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,760
we

1163
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,280
great if he's if this does not hold he

1164
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,240
immediately aborts and say I reject you

1165
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:46,520
if he's happy he's going to send T2 at

1166
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,520
random from the

1167
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:56,680
field what am I going to reply with what

1168
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,920
what should the Prov reply with

1169
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:03,520
so let's see

1170
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,520
G3 of X is

1171
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:22,319
what very

1172
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:22,319
good very good F of T1 T2 X and H4 up to

1173
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,440
hm yeah again we take essentially what

1174
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,760
happened here we reduced after T2 we

1175
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:38,799
reduced the problem to proving a sum

1176
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:42,400
check over sum F1 T1 T2 H3 up to hm and

1177
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:46,720
we need to check whether this is equal

1178
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:51,359
to a G2 of

1179
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,359
H2 of T2 sorry

1180
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,559
okay so again each time we kind of layer

1181
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:09,039
kind of get rid of one variable in the

1182
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:13,160
sum check we start with an narate sum

1183
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:13,160
check and each round we get rid of one

1184
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:21,920
variable okay last one what do we check

1185
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:21,920
here we got G3 what do we check

1186
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,839
what is the

1187
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,200
g33 exactly so first that G3 is low

1188
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:39,760
degree is

1189
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,760
degree most and some

1190
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:46,240
G3 is

1191
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,039
G2 and we continueing this way until we

1192
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,240
continue continue continue until we got

1193
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:52,480
rid of everything so in the last round

1194
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,039
what will happen in the last round in

1195
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,559
the last

1196
00:58:54,039 --> 00:59:00,079
round we will send

1197
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:03,960
g m minus one

1198
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:12,319
GM of like

1199
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:15,160
GMX which is f of T1 up to TN minus1

1200
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,400
X that's what he should check that's

1201
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,480
what you should send if you're honest

1202
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,160
that's what you send you peeled out off

1203
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,680
everything

1204
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:28,200
finally you're left with a with a GM

1205
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:30,119
which is F and M minus one X and then

1206
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,160
the verifier is done he'll choose a

1207
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:34,680
random

1208
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,440
TM and he will check whether this is

1209
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,880
indeed F of T1 of the TM we assumed he

1210
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,799
has Oracle access so we can check if

1211
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,839
this value is T1 of the TM okay so

1212
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:46,920
finally this is this and

1213
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,839
verifier I'm out of room but maybe I'll

1214
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,480
write

1215
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,480
here V

1216
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,359
chooses uh random TM

1217
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:03,000
and

1218
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:07,599
checks that g m of

1219
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,880
TM is equal to the Oracle he has F on T1

1220
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,880
up to

1221
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:14,680
T that's the

1222
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,119
protocol I'll give you a minute to

1223
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,960
appreciate the beauty while I eras the

1224
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,960
board

1225
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:36,079
you have

1226
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,480
a you're asking can I have a different

1227
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,680
set I can I can have a different set yes

1228
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,920
yeah so the question was do do the hes

1229
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,359
have to be identical and the answers

1230
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,160
they don't have to be identical you can

1231
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:50,559
take a we didn't use that anywhere and

1232
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:55,440
yeah it's somehow yeah somehow we always

1233
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,440
use it when it is but uh

1234
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:01,280
but but that's a very good point because

1235
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,000
it's like it seems more General it seems

1236
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,680
like it can be useful but somehow we

1237
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,680
don't use it

1238
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:11,400
uh but that's a very good good point

1239
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:15,079
yeah you can the hes does not have to be

1240
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:19,400
the same age you can be some over H1 of

1241
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:23,559
hm so particular H would be equal right

1242
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:27,920
okay H could be equal uh to F yes H

1243
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,920
could be equal to f um

1244
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,559
how do you

1245
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:37,799
do

1246
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:39,880
G1 sorry first line Su G1 H1 you will

1247
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:41,799
take time propal yeah but let's say

1248
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,839
that's

1249
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:46,119
okay again

1250
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:50,960
s yeah so let's we'll talk about

1251
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:56,160
soundness in a minute uh actually

1252
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:59,359
um if f is degree D the sist won't

1253
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,559
Decay I actually I think actually a okay

1254
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,160
let's talk about soundness and then

1255
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:07,279
we'll see actually the soundness won't

1256
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:10,119
uh in general usually when H is big in

1257
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:12,720
applications what happens often is when

1258
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:16,039
you take big H the F turns out to be

1259
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:19,000
degree H or H minus one so when we use

1260
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:20,720
this protocol so you know as I said this

1261
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,880
problem I'm say why do I care about this

1262
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,920
problem who cares about this problem so

1263
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,760
it turns out we care a lot it comes up

1264
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:30,960
all the time the way we use it in pra

1265
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:33,880
like the way it comes up is the F that

1266
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,920
we use usually is of degree hus one and

1267
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:39,119
each variable we use it in a way that

1268
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,520
that turns out to be the degree of F and

1269
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:43,960
the soundness decades with a degree so

1270
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,480
if the H is Big the soundness if the

1271
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,960
degree is Big the soundness is big but

1272
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,240
actually if your promis that the degree

1273
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:53,000
is small then we're good we we'll

1274
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,119
analyze it right now yeah can you say

1275
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,839
something about like what's so special

1276
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,839
about

1277
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,920
yes yes great question love the question

1278
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:11,240
so what what's so fascinating about

1279
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,319
polinomial that comes up here so the

1280
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,599
what it's kind of why is this so

1281
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,640
interesting why is colonial so so

1282
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:20,200
important you know that this comes up

1283
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,240
everywhere so here's my take and uh on

1284
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,480
this

1285
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:27,440
question everything can be okay first of

1286
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,799
all pooms are and St they're very very

1287
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,960
useful because of their their power of

1288
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,359
error correction so in other words what

1289
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:38,119
happens if you cheat it once we're going

1290
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:39,839
to amplify your cheat that's kind kind

1291
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:43,079
of what we do here right you cheat it

1292
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:47,440
once we're g to like for a random Point

1293
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:48,799
T you're if if you're low degree this

1294
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,079
we're assuming that this Pro gives kind

1295
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,520
of low degree low degree low degree all

1296
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,760
the time if you give low degree low

1297
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,119
degree low degree and you cheated then

1298
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,599
the cheat must be kind of corresponding

1299
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:00,640
a che a random Point like at the end a

1300
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:02,960
random Point T1 the TM you should be

1301
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,440
different and that's kind of we'll

1302
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,279
analyze this this is just intuition but

1303
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,279
that kind of the beauty of polinomial

1304
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:10,760
that if you're wrong you're wrong almost

1305
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:12,000
everywhere because if if it's not the

1306
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,680
correct polinomial then it's different

1307
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,440
from the correct bomal almost everywhere

1308
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:19,079
that's the short zip for the multivaried

1309
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,079
case for the single varied case it's

1310
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:24,359
just the the interpolation I guess it's

1311
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:25,760
called but okay now you're saying okay

1312
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,880
but that just pomal why am I saying

1313
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,079
comes what's so special about polinomial

1314
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,640
like why why are they so General okay if

1315
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,960
you happen to have a polinomial good

1316
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,160
good for you you won because it has such

1317
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,000
air crafting guarantees you're you're

1318
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,559
lucky it's your lucky day but what if

1319
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,520
it's like why is every day a lucky day

1320
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:44,279
kind of thing why is the poal come up

1321
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,440
come up everywhere and the answer is

1322
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:51,400
that you can actually embed many many

1323
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,400
problems into pols so there's a way

1324
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,480
there's a technique which we'll call low

1325
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,119
degree extension we'll see that pretty

1326
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:02,160
soon soon if not today then tomorrow

1327
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:05,000
then next week where uh a a you can kind

1328
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:07,799
of convert many problems into

1329
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,240
polinomial and then use the sum check so

1330
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:12,160
that's often what we do we take a

1331
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:14,039
problem we embed it into a polom we kind

1332
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,359
of extend it to look like a polinomial

1333
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:20,240
of low degree and then we use subject to

1334
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:20,240
it so that's how it will come

1335
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:28,160
up any any more questions before a

1336
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,880
before we analyze the subject protocol

1337
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,880
questions on the protocol

1338
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,880
itself

1339
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,599
or oh oh you're asking what you're

1340
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:54,359
asking you're saying this sum check do I

1341
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,039
really need this specific kind of a

1342
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:58,039
polinomial code or can I do using

1343
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:59,920
arbitrary codes kind of thing okay so

1344
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:02,920
actually this is a great great question

1345
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,279
uh there's a paper by or

1346
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:08,640
from several years ago I remember

1347
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:12,799
exactly where he shows how to do a sum

1348
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:14,960
check over more General codes not any

1349
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:17,160
kind of code but more General than that

1350
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,799
thing like tensor codes or Rachel do you

1351
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,640
remember you looked into it yeah t

1352
01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:24,400
tensor

1353
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:26,760
codes yeah so so he generalized it not

1354
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,279
to any code but he G the generalization

1355
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,680
this OC to work for big for a larger

1356
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:34,200
family

1357
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:37,319
of to ask the question what does it mean

1358
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,119
for the subject protocol to work for

1359
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:41,960
okay more good good good so you can

1360
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,200
think of it is I'm proving something

1361
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,599
about uh I don't remember exactly how

1362
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,520
his formalization was but it's like uh

1363
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:53,720
I'm proving something about a code

1364
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:55,960
word and I want kind of reinterpret this

1365
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:58,720
you can reinterpret this as a because

1366
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:02,680
you can think of the this F as being an

1367
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,400
aircraf in code so does it work only for

1368
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,680
this kind of read M this is called the

1369
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,039
read does it work only for read can you

1370
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:11,240
do it for arbitrary codes uh and he

1371
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,720
proves it for for arbitrary codes so

1372
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,599
this is kind of there's kind of a any

1373
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:17,760
polinomial is an air correcting code

1374
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,480
it's a type of air crafting code H for a

1375
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,279
multivaried case it's called read Muller

1376
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,839
for univ case is called re Solomon and

1377
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:27,480
so when the subject protocol for V think

1378
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:29,520
it is this protocol for read more codes

1379
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,359
and then you can ask is there a analog

1380
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:35,160
for other codes and actually there is

1381
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:38,960
there are analogs out there

1382
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:42,720
yeah okay any other questions

1383
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,720
yeah making the

1384
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:53,680
of that wouldn't like point of doing

1385
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:56,240
this because of like the size of H the

1386
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,839
log okay you're right so okay you're

1387
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,599
right so if there okay so the let me go

1388
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:03,200
back so the question is what what should

1389
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:05,160
this H be you know what is this H and

1390
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:07,440
the answer is this H can actually be all

1391
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,359
of f of course if it's all of f the

1392
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,200
verifier runs in time which is like the

1393
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:14,039
size of f because he checks you know Su

1394
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,120
over H if it's all of f you run the time

1395
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:18,520
all of f but maybe f is not that big

1396
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:22,920
maybe f is polinomial even if f is

1397
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:24,640
polinomial size still checking this sum

1398
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:28,880
is much bigger than F right it's like H

1399
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:30,839
to the n like f to the m m can be big so

1400
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,520
the the hardness does not come only from

1401
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:35,799
f it comes from M it's exponential in M

1402
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:39,080
it's the M that kind of makes it very

1403
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:41,120
hard and so H can be as large as the

1404
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,960
entire field and you can run some check

1405
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:46,600
over that too there's um it's still an

1406
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:48,960
interesting protocol yeah but if we that

1407
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,640
would we need to do an extension or

1408
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,960
something that good so okay the good so

1409
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,400
the question is wait do we get any

1410
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,239
aircraft in guarantees here because uh

1411
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,000
if we're doing over all of that and I

1412
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:03,239
think the answer is yes we we don't need

1413
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,719
to extend it further because as we see

1414
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:07,400
now we'll see now when we analyze it the

1415
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,239
soundless error goes down with something

1416
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:13,440
like d over f h does not come into play

1417
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:15,600
there but we'll see that let's let's see

1418
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,319
that together I I right I agree when you

1419
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,880
say that yeah that should right it

1420
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,120
should things should degrade with age

1421
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,199
but actually they don't so we'll see

1422
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:27,520
that now when we when we analyze

1423
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:29,400
it okay okay any any these are great

1424
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,279
great questions so thank you any other

1425
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,759
questions before we go to the

1426
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,520
analysis okay so actually before we do

1427
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:38,440
soundness let's just first do a sanity

1428
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,759
check on the com on the kind of

1429
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:43,440
communication complexity and the the

1430
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:47,600
runtime and so on so first let's see

1431
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:49,880
this protocol has n rounds each round we

1432
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:53,440
kind of get rid of one VAR one sum in

1433
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:57,520
the sum check right so

1434
01:09:53,440 --> 01:10:00,600
the so uh the communication complexity

1435
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,600
so our round

1436
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,760
complexity is M rounds M back and forth

1437
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,239
M to m i don't if you want to count each

1438
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,780
one or round is one two so let me just

1439
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,360
say

1440
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:19,560
[Music]

1441
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:19,560
order uh the the communication

1442
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:30,440
complexity is what um uh so each time uh

1443
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:33,080
po one polinomial is s and one field

1444
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:37,440
element so it's really a polinomial is a

1445
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:39,800
degree d right so it's just uh D field

1446
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:44,239
elements each time times

1447
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:46,600
n so fine we can do times you know log F

1448
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,600
if you want

1449
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:54,120
to so that's the communication

1450
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,239
complexity okay what about the verifier

1451
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,239
run time

1452
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,880
so the

1453
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:05,239
verifier he gets a polinomial degree D

1454
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,640
polinomial so D essentially field

1455
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:09,440
elements or D plus1 field elements and

1456
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,960
he just sums them up he checks that it's

1457
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:15,040
a degree D and sums them up that's all

1458
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:18,520
he does so it's really essentially the

1459
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:21,199
same for M rounds he has a degree D

1460
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:24,880
polinomial and he sums them I should put

1461
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:26,400
here maybe po log then because the sum I

1462
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,600
I'm assuming addition multiplication

1463
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:32,199
take poly log F again as I said often I

1464
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,640
think maybe even in the notes justtin

1465
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:37,800
Taylor's notes this is omitted it's like

1466
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,600
the feel thing of is one operation so

1467
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,120
just so you know if you read things

1468
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:46,520
often you won't see this part question

1469
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:48,639
ver the verifier also needs to choose

1470
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,639
the

1471
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:56,120
T yeah exactly so some over H is like H

1472
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:59,320
additions okay okay yeah he you sorry

1473
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:02,960
yeah so okay good uh you're saying he

1474
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:05,040
needs to compute uh it's still yeah so

1475
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,600
right so the the ver far he gets a

1476
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:12,719
polinomial he needs to evaluate the

1477
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:15,480
polinomial in h so yeah so for M rounds

1478
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:18,719
he gets a degree D polinomial he needs

1479
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:22,840
to evaluate

1480
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:26,440
it oh sorry this does not have

1481
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,920
H yeah you need to evaluate it in in uh

1482
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:31,920
H

1483
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:34,600
points the degree D polinomial and then

1484
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,600
a

1485
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,360
log thanks

1486
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:50,000
good thanks a lot good catch that's

1487
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,400
awesome okay great so that's the

1488
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,400
verifier as I said the PO we care less

1489
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,800
about but just you know if you want to

1490
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,239
just

1491
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,239
and and by the way this is assuming the

1492
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:01,960
verifier has access to F he knows f f is

1493
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,320
kind of he has Oracle access to it

1494
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,520
because of course at the end he needs to

1495
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,600
check equality with f so this we just

1496
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,239
assume he has oral access to F and then

1497
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,239
the prover what he does he need to do

1498
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:15,239
well he needs to do this computation so

1499
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:18,800
he runs in time like H to the m he needs

1500
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:21,239
to do all the sum he needs to run so the

1501
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,960
polinomial so it's called a t subf is

1502
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:28,800
the time to run uh to compute F so we

1503
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:31,040
need to compute F uh he needs to uh do

1504
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:37,159
the sum overall fs and he does that kind

1505
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:37,159
of a d m times right something like

1506
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:46,080
this A and polog H polog F

1507
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:57,000
sorry

1508
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:57,000
yeah so that's the pro ver test

1509
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,920
okay

1510
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,040
yes no good good good good good great

1511
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:15,840
question no so you're okay so even if V

1512
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:17,560
has random Oracle access to F he can

1513
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,120
compute this entire thing but it will

1514
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:23,120
take him time H to the end because he

1515
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:25,440
needs to computer some so the the goal

1516
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,920
he needs to check so let's say Computing

1517
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,120
F once it takes the one time you can

1518
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,440
kind of ask but to check the sum he

1519
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,280
needs to

1520
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:35,880
ask this an H to the m question now

1521
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:39,520
think of H of them is

1522
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:41,800
huge even if a even if H is two think of

1523
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:46,199
M as being Big M is like n variable so

1524
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:48,639
it's like exponential that's it great

1525
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:52,280
question but should I think of the

1526
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:53,560
description of f Pol or good so you can

1527
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,440
okay there's two options you can think

1528
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,360
of the description of f as being

1529
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,960
polinomial that's one option or that you

1530
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,840
can compute F in it's like described by

1531
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,760
a polinomial size circuit or you can

1532
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,400
think it can be large but the verifier

1533
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,080
has access to it somehow the verifier

1534
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,960
has like a trusted Oracle that computes

1535
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,719
app for

1536
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:13,280
him

1537
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:15,280
okay great okay so now the

1538
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:18,120
so

1539
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:21,679
yes good yeah this is just sorry this

1540
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,679
it's just the time it takes to compute

1541
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,480
F thanks

1542
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,040
yeah because he needs to comp the

1543
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,840
approver supposedly doesn't have he

1544
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,840
needs to actually do the

1545
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:41,840
computation okay great yes um whereing

1546
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:43,960
that into account the theover finding G

1547
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,639
of One X like don't they have to combine

1548
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:50,400
a bunch of terms order of oh yeah but uh

1549
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:53,320
he runs in time F anyway f is much

1550
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,480
bigger than D so the degree is also

1551
01:15:53,320 --> 01:16:00,440
always much smaller

1552
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:03,719
F so it's I'm kind of lumping it in yeah

1553
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,719
thanks great question

1554
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:15,719
yeah something else again you're saying

1555
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,080
if you you want to be even you you're

1556
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:19,360
saying let's say the verifier wants to

1557
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,639
be even more efficient than this then

1558
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,960
what can you do can I choose H to be

1559
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:25,679
like special structure okay but you're

1560
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,280
changing the problem you what you're

1561
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,760
saying is so the problem is H is given

1562
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,080
to us and you want to prove now you're

1563
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,880
saying maybe if H has a special

1564
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,440
structure maybe we can be even more

1565
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:40,639
efficient is what you're saying

1566
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:42,239
a good question a I haven't thought

1567
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:45,080
about

1568
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:48,440
itation yeah like you can probably uh

1569
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:49,880
yeah yeah probably you can you can so V

1570
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,199
not was saying you can probably batch

1571
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,880
things or probably yeah I think if you

1572
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:56,760
can choose H if H is of a certain

1573
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,760
structure then I think you can do better

1574
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,040
but this is kind of your the verifier

1575
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,880
doesn't choose it like that's what's

1576
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:09,520
given them great okay

1577
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:12,520
great okay any more any more a

1578
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,520
questions

1579
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:24,000
yeah oh okay it's degree D but it's m

1580
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,040
variables so in General Degree D

1581
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,560
polinomial with m variables can have

1582
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:31,000
size like m to the D so which is can be

1583
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,400
very big great question a d to the m

1584
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,400
sorry yeah great great

1585
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:41,239
question okay okay so let's go to

1586
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:43,719
completeness and soundness then so what

1587
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:44,960
is the completeness of this protocol if

1588
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:46,800
let's say the pro is honest the

1589
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,480
statement is correct with what

1590
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:52,679
probability will the verifier

1591
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,360
accept one exactly because you'll just

1592
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:55,960
be honest you always give the C nomial

1593
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,080
always be Lo degree will always sum to

1594
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,880
what it should be and you always going

1595
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,760
accept it that's easy the hard part is

1596
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,719
soundness so let's do the soundness and

1597
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,719
then after soundness we'll take

1598
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:17,400
a okay so for sound this here's the idea

1599
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,840
suppose so let's look at it fix suppose

1600
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,560
there's a cheating

1601
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:24,560
prover that generates a false clip so

1602
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,560
suppose

1603
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,600
that the claim is

1604
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:35,719
false mainly this sum of

1605
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,520
f is actually not

1606
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:49,480
big okay so we start with the false CL

1607
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:52,560
the first thing we know is that and so

1608
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:56,440
fix any so you you fix a claim that's

1609
01:18:52,560 --> 01:19:00,080
false fix any piece

1610
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:02,440
he tries to cheat let's show that he he

1611
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,199
fails like he won't succeed or succeed

1612
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:06,120
very small probability the field is

1613
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:08,440
large enough so let's

1614
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:12,880
see first the first thing I want to

1615
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:15,880
point out which I mentioned before is G1

1616
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,120
must be false G so it must be the case

1617
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:23,080
no matter how he cheats and he gives me

1618
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:26,360
a bad G1 okay it cannot if he's accepted

1619
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:29,560
if the Prov is accepted then G1 cannot

1620
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,920
be sum of

1621
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:37,239
a call

1622
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:39,440
g1x is not sum of f H2 up to

1623
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:42,120
hm because I'm going to check that it's

1624
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:45,199
equal to Beta but the sum of f is not

1625
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:49,639
beta so the G that he gives me cannot be

1626
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:49,639
the correct F like the correct

1627
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:55,560
G okay so in other words he starts the

1628
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,480
protocol by a cheat a the first message

1629
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,320
is not the correct

1630
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,040
polinomial okay because the correct

1631
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,440
polinomial if you Summit you'll get the

1632
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,840
real beta not the fake

1633
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:09,840
beta okay that he

1634
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:11,239
claimed okay however at the end of the

1635
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,920
day if you're

1636
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:16,400
accepted the final check when you check

1637
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,280
then you check with respect to the

1638
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,560
honest F right and that verifies so at

1639
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:26,040
the end of the day when you left with G

1640
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,400
to the like the last one GM to the TM

1641
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,719
that's actually

1642
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:34,040
honest so somewh the protocol you had to

1643
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:38,000
move from a

1644
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,000
bad G to a good

1645
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:44,840
G okay so again here's the

1646
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:47,880
claim so I want to argue if so let there

1647
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:51,760
I want to argue there must exist a round

1648
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:54,920
such that around let's say I so to Pro

1649
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,920
to cheat

1650
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,040
there must exist around

1651
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,560
I such

1652
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:11,800
that

1653
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:18,719
GI is false so GI is not sum of

1654
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:23,719
T1 t i-1 x h i +1 up to hm this is what

1655
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:23,719
it should be but it's not

1656
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:31,400
and yet at some point but g i +

1657
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:43,800
one is actually equal to oh I forgot

1658
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:43,800
f is actually equal to some f T1 up to

1659
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:56,560
ti so to cheat you must go so you start

1660
01:21:54,239 --> 01:22:00,400
with with you start with an

1661
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:02,600
incorrect A A polom we know that's for

1662
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,560
sure because you assuming you're you're

1663
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:09,280
accepted if you're accepted G1 is false

1664
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,560
now either now G2 is true and then I'll

1665
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,239
show that happens with very small

1666
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,280
probability or G2 is also false if G2 is

1667
01:22:13,239 --> 01:22:18,080
false I G3 is true I'm going to show

1668
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:21,320
that happens with very small probability

1669
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,719
or G or G3 is false until we're left

1670
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:25,280
with

1671
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:27,440
GM which again let but it's still I'm

1672
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,320
going to argue that if G minus one was

1673
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,840
false GM is also false with very high

1674
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:34,639
probability but if GM is

1675
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,360
false you're not going to be if GM is

1676
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:40,880
actually not

1677
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:42,880
F then for random T the probability that

1678
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,520
you'll get f is very very you'll be

1679
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,159
consistent with f is very very small

1680
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,440
because these are two different

1681
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:50,280
polinomial and they agree only on D

1682
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,000
points so what's the probability that I

1683
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:55,080
chose one of these D's one of these

1684
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,600
points D over f

1685
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,600
okay so let me let me be a little more

1686
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:02,800
formal

1687
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:06,159
now okay so I want to argue that part me

1688
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:09,679
argue that so first to cheat there must

1689
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:11,719
exist some round where we go from F from

1690
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:15,080
from false to true because the final

1691
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:16,600
final check must be true otherwise

1692
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,960
you're I'm going to check you with the

1693
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,400
true so there must exist a around that

1694
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,040
you go from false to True let's see

1695
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:26,440
what's the probability of going from

1696
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,440
false to true

1697
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:34,360
so good so what's the probability so

1698
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:36,040
let's denote this event let's knowe this

1699
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:38,400
event by

1700
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:41,239
bi now let's see what's the probability

1701
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:44,040
that this events happen this is kind of

1702
01:23:41,239 --> 01:23:46,840
a bad event an event that you go from a

1703
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,719
bad incorrect a false to true that's for

1704
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,880
the ver part it's a very bad event

1705
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,800
because then he accepts a false

1706
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:55,760
statement what is the probability that

1707
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:58,679
this bad event happen so the

1708
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:02,840
probability of

1709
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:02,840
B I want to argue is that

1710
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:11,199
most D over F let's see

1711
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,639
why

1712
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:17,560
so when is let's see when is GI + one

1713
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:20,440
true we're sending here like the very

1714
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:23,159
the probability let's fix like we fixed

1715
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:26,320
already T1 of the ti plus1 that's fixed

1716
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:30,520
okay so fix and I don't care how t one

1717
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,520
up to t i minus one this

1718
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:37,239
defines like the what the prover

1719
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,719
gives GI in the protocol the cheating

1720
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:41,159
prover gives in the

1721
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:44,800
protocol okay

1722
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:48,600
now now the verifier chooses a random t

1723
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,639
a random uh so good so this defines GI

1724
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:55,320
which is uh okay this is my G now the

1725
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:59,199
prover the verifier the probability over

1726
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:59,199
TI that the verifier

1727
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:06,199
chooses This Ti tells you if GI this

1728
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:09,000
defines GI +

1729
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:13,719
one but when it's

1730
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,719
if what do we know about when

1731
01:25:14,119 --> 01:25:26,320
if we know that because the verifier is

1732
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:26,320
accepted we know that some g i +1 of

1733
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:34,400
H is equal to

1734
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:34,400
GI which is the wrong

1735
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,600
polinomial

1736
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:41,639
so

1737
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,960
uh sorry

1738
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:51,600
NTI and this is the wrong polinomial so

1739
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,440
what is the probability that for so so

1740
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,639
in other words J + one is the wrong

1741
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,280
polom

1742
01:25:55,639 --> 01:26:00,719
what is the probability that for a

1743
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:04,159
random T it will be the right

1744
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,159
one D over

1745
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,280
F because two polinomial that are

1746
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,880
different agree on it most D points I

1747
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,719
chose a random point the probability

1748
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:19,040
that it's one of these D is D over

1749
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:19,040
F so what is the probability that you

1750
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:28,880
cheat at this is the

1751
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:32,280
probability that there exist some

1752
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,199
I such that bi holds a bad event holds

1753
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:36,719
namely there exists an eye that you go

1754
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:41,000
from True from false to

1755
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:46,280
true and that IE by the union bound this

1756
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:49,639
is at most M number of rounds Times the

1757
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:52,800
probability of one of a specific b b me

1758
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:56,440
which is D over

1759
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:57,639
F so just just note H actually doesn't

1760
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:01,880
come

1761
01:26:57,639 --> 01:27:01,880
up in the soundness this is the

1762
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:11,000
soundness okay so the sinus needs M time

1763
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,920
D to be significantly smaller than the

1764
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,400
field

1765
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:19,239
size that's all that's important for

1766
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:22,239
sence yeah so Point like

1767
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:22,239
the

1768
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:27,920
have exact exactly the point is if

1769
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,800
you're not happy if f is not large

1770
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,440
enough if it's not much bigger than m

1771
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,960
the m * D then you just make it bigger

1772
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,880
you can take you can take extension

1773
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,119
Fields you can take so you just kind of

1774
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,880
artificially increase F so that F will

1775
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:43,480
be much larger than M * D and hence

1776
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,480
you'll get a small

1777
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:49,480
s

1778
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,760
applications what happens is given H

1779
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:55,719
right and the degree happens to be uh H

1780
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:57,840
ESS or h that's why it doesn't make

1781
01:27:55,719 --> 01:28:02,280
sense for H and to be the same but you

1782
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:06,119
can dis exactly can dis 100% so let me

1783
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:08,000
repeat it because I'm recorded you're

1784
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:11,960
not yeah because that's a very good

1785
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,560
point the the point is for Su in general

1786
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,400
it makes sense to consider any ag even H

1787
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:19,600
which is of size f is interesting for

1788
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:21,920
the Su protocol okay in application

1789
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:25,000
because as long as the D is small of

1790
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:27,920
course in applications often it turns

1791
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,960
out that the when we use the sub check

1792
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,679
it turns out that the D is often equal

1793
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,960
to the size of

1794
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:37,159
H okay because we kind of do the slow

1795
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,679
degree extension which makes the field

1796
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:43,560
as large as

1797
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:45,520
H and then if a if if we take H which

1798
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:47,760
becomes the degree to be F this is

1799
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,719
Meaningful

1800
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,159
meaningless so for

1801
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:55,040
application often indeed H is small but

1802
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:56,480
for the sum of prot it's own you can

1803
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,560
make you can take eight to be the entire

1804
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:03,960
field yes is it that find F like it's

1805
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:06,639
easy to put another yeah okay good good

1806
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,600
good yes exactly so let me yeah so it

1807
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:10,880
there's kind of uh you can take so this

1808
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:14,159
is a fact from mathematics you can take

1809
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:16,600
any finite field and embed it into a

1810
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:18,040
bigger finite field and how big is the

1811
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,480
bigger finite field kind of as big as

1812
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:23,400
you want so you can take any Loosely

1813
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:25,480
speaking you can take any F and embed it

1814
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:28,000
into kind of a field F to the

1815
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:30,320
N uh so when you can take n as big as

1816
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,320
you want so you can kind of that's

1817
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:35,600
what's called an extension

1818
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:38,560
field so you can kind of extend it to as

1819
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:41,920
large size as you want while still

1820
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:44,080
keeping f as a sub field so operations

1821
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,560
in F kind of behave exactly as they did

1822
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,719
before so without ruing the sum or

1823
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:51,320
anything like

1824
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:52,880
that this Anis right is it really the

1825
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:55,320
case that there is actually a chea

1826
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,320
strategy that succeeds with yes this

1827
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:00,880
yeah this good this analysis is really

1828
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,400
tight so I mean if if I'm malicious you

1829
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,440
know I can always hope for the best if

1830
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,760
it happens to be I'm malicious I give

1831
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,800
you the wrong polinomial look you may

1832
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:10,800
find so I want to go from the wrong Pol

1833
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,719
to the true polinomial that's what to

1834
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,920
cheat right that's what I want to do now

1835
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:18,239
the the my wrong poal and the true

1836
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:21,800
polinomial they agree the points any two

1837
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:24,920
pomal can agree on the points so as long

1838
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:26,920
as the verifier I'm lucky enough that

1839
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,159
this T is one of the deep points I mean

1840
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,320
look I got a good pomal I'll continue

1841
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:34,320
with a good pomal till the end of now

1842
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:36,800
I'm I'm in kind of a h La La Land you

1843
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,440
know I'm happy uh the problem is the

1844
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,600
chance each one the chance that you'll

1845
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:43,480
give me a t that's one of the D points

1846
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:45,719
is only D over F and a union bound over

1847
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:47,560
everything it's n times D over F and if

1848
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:50,920
f is much much bigger than n times D

1849
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:53,040
then you know uh the chances that the

1850
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:55,920
Prov will Su will be in this L land is

1851
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,920
very small

1852
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:03,400
okay any any questions further questions

1853
01:31:00,679 --> 01:31:03,400
about the subject

1854
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:10,440
protocol okay so let's take maybe kind

1855
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:12,400
of a five minute break to stretch and so

1856
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:16,639
on and then we'll show application we'll

1857
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,639
start showing applications for this
