1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,360
all right so if you haven't figured it

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,799
out we're going to do something entirely

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,200
different now than everything that we've

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,279
heard about this afternoon which is

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,559
great because this is the last Talk of

6
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,559
the day so I I'm in the space section I

7
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,160
gather because I do astrochemistry

8
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,240
research and I'll talk a little bit

9
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,520
about that and about the applications of

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,160
this work specifically to my research

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,560
but the the work that I'm going to

12
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,199
present the new techniques that we have

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,960
developed are agnostic to the

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
application that you're working with

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,439
right and the real question is if you're

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,200
handed a bottle that contains an unknown

17
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,040
liquid in it how do you figure out

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,040
what's in that liquid right and that

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,640
sample could be from anywhere right it

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,559
doesn't necessarily have to be related

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,280
to space now I'm interested in that

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,920
bottle being the universe right I want

23
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,360
to figure out what molecules are out

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,600
there in space right but chemical

25
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,559
mixtures like this are ubiquitous and

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,000
they present a lot of problems to us

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,559
right so you can imagine trying to

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,879
figure out what is in the emissions

29
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,359
coming off of a Coal Fired power plant

30
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,120
right what's coming out of those Smoke

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,120
Stacks are are scrubbers working

32
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,119
appropriately are the technologies that

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
we have developed to make the uh

34
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,799
emissions from these things as

35
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,320
environmentally friendly as possible

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,439
actually working right you could design

37
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,000
a detector to measure carbon dioxide

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,000
that's not a problem that's not the

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,119
question at hand the question at hand is

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,360
what else is up there is it just carbon

41
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,360
dioxide right you can also ask the

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,600
question well what if you're dealing

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,119
with a spill right a waste tanker tips

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,320
over and dumps a whole bunch of organic

45
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,640
chemistry waste into a natural water

46
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,320
habitat right you scoop up a sample of

47
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,759
that you want to know what's there right

48
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,320
you want to figure out what's in that

49
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,720
sample that's polluting that environment

50
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,479
or even in the laboratory or in

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,840
industrial settings you're developing a

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,520
new pharmaceutical process a new

53
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,840
reaction scheme and you want to figure

54
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,000
out what side products are you making is

55
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,159
there something in there that's killing

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,640
your reaction is there something in

57
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,560
there that's poisoning your catalyst is

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,759
there's something in that that will

59
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,880
poison your patient right and in my case

60
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,640
of course I I'll I'll talk about this a

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,320
little bit just as the the interest

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,520
application here space right I'm an

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,679
astrochemist I want to figure out what

64
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,560
the chemical components are along the

65
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,319
entire process of forming stars and

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,760
planets so going all the way back to the

67
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,319
Big Bang which made all of the elements

68
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,120
uh the the hydrogen and the helium uh

69
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,319
that make up the universe those got

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,280
fused together in stars to make carbon

71
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,319
and nitrogen and oxygen and sulfur and

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,680
phosphorus right what's that process

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,959
look like what do the clouds of gas and

74
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,879
dust that are formed from those raw

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,800
elements look like what molecules are

76
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,800
made at different stages along the

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,879
process of forming stars and planets

78
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,879
right now popular television would have

79
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,400
you believe that we already have the

80
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,280
tools to do this all right so if this uh

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,040
media clip here works I'll show you a

82
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,599
clip from one of my favorite TV series

83
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,879
here bones uh that shows you how you

84
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,640
figure out what the chemical components

85
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,560
of a mixture are you just use the laser

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,799
l a s a r analysis

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,799
Suite uh let's see do we have

88
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,799
audio

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,879
maybe maybe not that's all right it'll

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,400
freeze frame right

91
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,400
there can we try

92
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,720
again nope apparently not all right so

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,799
what they're putting out here right and

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,799
it's going to pause right there

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,640
ohes all right we'll try one more time

96
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,640
it's a 2C

97
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,360
clipes yeah so apparently you take this

98
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,920
mixture and you put it in this machine

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,080
and 10 minutes later it tells you that

100
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,879
it contains

101
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,680
cardamum cardamum is not a molecule

102
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,439
right cardamum is a spice the flavor of

103
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,280
which is dominated by a dozen say

104
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
different specific flavor compounds that

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
maybe you could design something to

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,439
detect right but this is absolutely

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,959
insane now I have Cherry Picked a

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,879
terrible example here right there are

109
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,760
less insane examples in the shows where

110
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,640
they use a GC Mass Spec and they say it

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,199
contains this alcohol and this Esther

112
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,359
and this Ketone those are mildly more

113
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,479
realistic right but this is still the

114
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,240
realm of Science Fiction we don't have

115
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,120
the capability right now to robustly put

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,120
in a sample of anything you want and

117
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,240
have a machine tell you precisely what

118
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,720
is in it right

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
and that's what I want to actually work

120
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,400
toward we do have a number of powerful

121
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,600
analytical tools though right and most

122
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
of these are spectroscopically based so

123
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,000
the interaction of light with matter so

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,520
we have infrared spectroscopy infrared

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
spectroscopy tells us about the

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,840
vibrational motions of molecules so how

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,520
the carbons and hydrogens and oxygens

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,680
Bend and stretch with respect to one

129
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,199
another in a molecule these are distinct

130
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,080
fingerprints for those molecules they're

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,280
also distinctly um they group together

132
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,880
in uh very characteristic uh wavelength

133
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,639
ranges so the C double bond o stretch of

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,240
one molecule looks an awful lot like

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,280
that same stretch in another molecule

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,479
you get these characteristic modes which

137
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,759
can tell you something about the

138
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,039
chemical contents of your system right

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,320
you can also use techniques like NMR

140
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,479
right this is telling you something

141
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,680
about how the nuclear spins the actual

142
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,360
components of the atoms themselves are

143
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,440
interacting with one another how the

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
structure of that molecule is built up

145
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,240
you could of course use Mass

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
spectrometry which will tell you about

147
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,400
the mass of the molecules that are in

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,319
your sample as well as breaking those

149
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,039
molecules apart and telling you how they

150
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,639
fragment into smaller and smaller pieces

151
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,280
and there's actually a technology that's

152
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,720
been around for a while but it's only

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,680
now seeing some commercial application

154
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,919
uh and that is rotational spectroscopy

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,000
or what's being called microwave

156
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,479
rotational resonance this is the

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,199
signatures of the molecule that the the

158
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,440
molecules give off or absorb as they

159
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:00,479
rotate freely tumbling end over end in

160
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:03,880
space these also turn out to be um

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,759
highly distinct right they are unique

162
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,240
fingerprints for these molecules at

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,560
least in the gas phase now that's what

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,639
I'm going to be focusing on today I'm

165
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,960
going to tell you about analyses using

166
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,440
microwave spectroscopy because that's

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,800
what my lab here at MIT does all but the

168
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,759
techniques that I'm going to talk about

169
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,000
work for any of these other sorts of

170
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,360
analysis tools anything where you can

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,400
have a unique fingerprint for a molecule

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,160
that's in a database and you want to

173
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,120
match that to that same measurement in

174
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,759
the lab

175
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,919
we can use the machine learning tools

176
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,479
that we're developing here to do that so

177
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,400
what's the application here why am I

178
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,720
using rotational spectroscopy well as I

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,560
said I'm an astrochemist and

180
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,599
astrochemistry is the study of molecules

181
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,360
in space where they are how they got

182
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:48,360
there and what they are doing and I am

183
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,080
interested as I said in understanding

184
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,560
how chemistry evolves from The Big Bang

185
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,599
through the process of forming a

186
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,440
molecular cloud of gas and dust that

187
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,599
will eventually collapse down to form a

188
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,599
star that will eventually form planets

189
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,000
and those planets will be seated with

190
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,840
the raw organic materials for life that

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
at least on one example we know of

192
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,759
actually occurs and arises right and I

193
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,960
want to understand on a molecule by

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,919
molecule and reaction by reaction basis

195
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,759
how that happens and to do that I have

196
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,360
to know what molecules are in that

197
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,000
mixture at each different stage I have

198
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,120
to be able to look at the cloud and say

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,840
these 150 molecules are here that way I

200
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
can think about how they're reacting and

201
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,000
evolving and it turns out the way that

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,280
we do that is using rotational

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,960
spectroscopy 95% of molecules detected

204
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,960
in space are seen using their rotational

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,680
Spectrum which is why I do rotational

206
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,759
spectroscopy now I added a slide here

207
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,599
just while I was sitting over there a

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,159
few minutes ago because apparently it's

209
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,879
MIT and I'm allowed to show you

210
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,159
equations so I'm going to put an

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
equation up here I'm going to tell you

212
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,280
how a rotational Spectrum arises and

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,879
what it depends on uh don't worry this

214
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,199
the only equations in the entire talk

215
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,080
and they're really simple here right so

216
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,800
to first order

217
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,800
the frequencies of a molecule's

218
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,599
rotational Spectrum meaning the

219
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,560
frequencies of light that the molecule

220
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,240
gives off or absorbs as it rotates and

221
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,120
tumbles end overend in space is given by

222
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,919
2 * B * J + 1 so what are these well J

223
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,440
is just a quantum number it's an integer

224
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,560
or a half integer it's just a way of

225
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,800
keeping track of the actual uh quantum

226
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,479
mechanics that's happening here the

227
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,400
quantization of energy B is something

228
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,000
called the rotational constant right

229
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,599
this contains all of the unique

230
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,120
information about the molecule that

231
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,919
matters right so what's in the

232
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,680
rotational constant well a bunch of more

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,039
fundamental constants like Plank's

234
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,760
constant the speed of light the number

235
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,519
eight and this thing here I the moment

236
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,279
of inertia of the molecule which if you

237
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,920
think back to freshman physics is the

238
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,600
reduced mass times the separation of

239
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,880
those masses and if we're talking about

240
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,399
just two atoms here in this simple case

241
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,120
the reduced mass is M1 M2 over M1 +

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,040
M2 okay I'm done that's all of the

243
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,880
equation in the entire talk I think but

244
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,680
why did I put them up here well look

245
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,200
back at this set of equations that

246
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,480
determine the rotational spectrum of a

247
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,720
molecule what does it depend on it

248
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,120
depends on only two

249
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,240
things the masses in the molecule and

250
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,800
how they're arranged in space right and

251
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,880
that is it everything else is a

252
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
fundamental constant which means that

253
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,480
the rotational frequencies of a molecule

254
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,360
its Spectrum are uniquely determined by

255
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,320
the 3D structure of that molecule that

256
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,399
means that no two molecules by the laws

257
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,160
of physics can have the exact same

258
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,959
rotational Spectrum it is a unique

259
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,519
fingerprint right every molecule has a

260
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,440
unique Spectrum determined by its

261
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,800
structure so here's just a few different

262
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,399
random examples right acetic acid glycol

263
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,360
alahh and methyl formate here they all

264
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,800
have distinct spectral patterns in the

265
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,000
microwave region of the electromagnetic

266
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,480
spectrum and those allow us to then

267
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,399
uniquely identify these molecules if we

268
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,000
can measure those Spectra but to

269
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,920
highlight just how sensitive microwave

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,720
spectroscopy is to Atomic Structure I

271
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,200
don't even need to change the molecule

272
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,399
to get a different Spectrum I can change

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,920
a single Neutron if I change from carbon

274
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,880
12 to carbon 13 the entire rotational

275
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,800
spectrum of the molecule will change

276
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,279
because we've changed a mass one Neutron

277
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
is enough to change the Spectrum so

278
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,760
here's an actual spectrum of a source

279
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,800
taken in space uh Source in space that I

280
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,480
took with a rad radio telescope here and

281
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,320
what we're seeing are lines coming from

282
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,560
this molecule hc5n you can see on the

283
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,360
right hand side here the main line here

284
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,399
it's you know much much stronger going

285
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,560
off the graph here of one of the

286
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,680
transitions of this molecule but most of

287
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,680
these other lines are from transitions

288
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,959
of this molecule in its isotopically

289
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,880
substituted form so this one here is

290
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,440
from adding a neutron to the nitrogen

291
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,200
this one here is adding a neutron to

292
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,200
that carbon to that carbon to that

293
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,959
carbon that carbon that carbon and then

294
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,399
swapping that hydrogen out for a dyum

295
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,040
tiny changes in masses completely change

296
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,160
that Spectrum it makes it this unique

297
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,079
fingerprint and that means that we can

298
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,839
uniquely identify these if we can

299
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,040
measure the Spectrum in the laboratory

300
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,639
and compare it to our Spectrum wherever

301
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,000
we're working with in my case again

302
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,639
space so here's an actual example here

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,880
is a spectrum of a source called tmc1

304
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,600
I'll tell you a little bit more about

305
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,600
later taken with a radio telescope this

306
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
is an inter Cellar cloud and what you're

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,320
seeing here are signals in the radio

308
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,720
regime of molecule that have

309
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,160
rotated 450 light years away emitted

310
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,360
photons to relax and those photons have

311
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,560
traveled 450 light years passed through

312
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,920
all of that empty space through the

313
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,560
solar system through all of those

314
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,040
satellite constellations through the

315
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,920
atmosphere and landed in our tiny little

316
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,440
telescope for us to detect and now if we

317
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
want to know what we come from what they

318
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,720
come from we just overlay the spectrum

319
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,200
of a molecule we think is likely to be

320
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,240
there from the laboratory in this case

321
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,760
the cyanomethyl radical

322
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,880
ch2cn right we measure the Spectrum on

323
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,639
Earth that Spectrum doesn't change no

324
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,120
matter where you are in the universe

325
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,920
this is the only molecule in the

326
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,040
universe that could give this exact

327
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,160
pattern this exact set of lines because

328
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,399
any deviation from that exact molecule

329
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,880
would change where these lines lie so

330
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,040
that gives us this unique identification

331
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,920
right it tells us this molecule is

332
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,560
present in the mixture that is this

333
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,120
astrochemical

334
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,920
Cloud

335
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,120
so if we want to pick apart what's in

336
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,639
these mixtures at the moment we do this

337
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,519
almost entirely by hand right so what's

338
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,160
the process of analyzing one of these

339
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,160
chemical mixtures either in an

340
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,880
astronomical Source or we can take a

341
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
spectrum using our our instruments in

342
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,240
the lab here in the basement of MIT so

343
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,279
we take that Spectrum this one you can

344
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,680
actually automate to to an extent right

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,839
so here's an example of a spectrum from

346
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,760
uh a laboratory here on Earth this is

347
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
just a a discharge mixture where we blew

348
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,519
up some acetylene with some carbon

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,240
disulfide we made a whole bunch of lines

350
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,720
here right this contains hundreds of

351
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
different molecules this is the

352
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,600
rotational spectrum of every molecule in

353
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,880
the sample all emitting at us at once

354
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,800
now we need to pick apart what's in

355
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,959
there right what molecules are giving

356
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,240
rise to these signals well what we want

357
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,399
to do first is identify all of the known

358
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,000
components right identify the pieces of

359
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,320
spectrum that belong to molecules that

360
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,320
we have previously measured the lines

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,920
are in a database that pattern is known

362
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,600
to us and once that is sorted out then

363
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
we can focus on the unknown molecules

364
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
the new

365
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,839
things well the problem here is that

366
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,240
doing this for a trained PhD

367
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,959
spectroscopist this process H takes

368
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,000
somewhere between days and weeks for a

369
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,199
single Spectrum right to actually

370
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,959
painstakingly go through line by line

371
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,560
think about what might be there pull

372
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,560
them up from the database look analyze

373
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,000
and move on so it's a lengthy process

374
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,680
and if we actually want to identify the

375
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,920
unknown components this takes even more

376
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,079
work right this is a process that can

377
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,920
take months realistically to do because

378
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,480
we don't have those Spectra in a

379
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,440
database right what we have to do is use

380
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,800
our chemical intuition we have to think

381
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,519
about well these are the molecules that

382
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,040
are currently in the mixture the known

383
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,720
components what else might be there and

384
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,440
then go procure a sample of those

385
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,360
molecules put them in the instrument

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,959
measure its spectrum and then compare it

387
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,759
and see whether or not those signals are

388
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,160
present in the mixture or not a

389
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,320
painstaking process that involves a lot

390
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,079
of human interaction and so what we

391
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,199
wanted to do was try to bring Automation

392
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,560
and machine learning to bear on both of

393
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,600
these tasks to try to speed this process

394
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,040
up so most of what I'm going to focus on

395
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,480
today is this identification of known

396
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,120
components because this is essentially

397
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,240
what they do in Bones right you put in a

398
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,920
sample and it spits back out what the

399
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,800
components are that it knows about that

400
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,440
it has in a database and it does it

401
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,880
pretty much instantly it doesn't need

402
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,959
days or weeks of human intervention so

403
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,880
can we do this with machine learning

404
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,600
well we can actually do a lot of this

405
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,079
get close using standard conventional

406
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,519
practices so how might we do this well

407
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,320
well we could go line by line pull a

408
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,600
line out of our Spectrum fit a gaus into

409
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,199
it figure out what the center frequency

410
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,839
is and then just query a database of all

411
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,040
Spectra of all known molecules and find

412
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,639
the lines in that database that are

413
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,279
closest to the line in our Spectrum

414
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,600
right so say we have two molecules A and

415
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,839
B here clearly a is the better match

416
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
right it's right on that Center

417
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,480
frequency we could assign that no

418
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,959
problem this is this is Trivial this is

419
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,680
already done with traditional uh

420
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,560
computational approaches now we actually

421
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,000
know more from rotational spectroscopy

422
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,480
than just one line we know the whole

423
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,040
pattern has to be there right so then we

424
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,680
could go and expand out and say well if

425
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,240
that line belongs there well do other

426
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,680
lines of that molecule also show up

427
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,959
right so in the top we have molecule C

428
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,560
that has all three pieces of its

429
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,199
Spectrum showing up exactly where

430
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,639
they're supposed to be in the relative

431
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,079
intensity ordering that they're supposed

432
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,560
to have whereas in the bottom well

433
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,279
molecule D here aligns with this one

434
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,519
really well but if this was actually the

435
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
correct assignment there'd be another

436
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,279
line over here and we don't see anything

437
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
in the Spectrum right so molecule D

438
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,600
probably not there this is also

439
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,399
something that can be done with

440
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,880
traditional Computing but here's the

441
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,120
problem I haven't told you about one

442
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,800
other important factor and that's

443
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,399
experimental error right the line

444
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,000
frequencies in these databases have

445
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,720
errors associated with them because we

446
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,959
measured them in the laboratory there is

447
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,920
some uncertainty so here's a more

448
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,319
realistic scenario I have a line from

449
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,319
the laboratory and it turns out there's

450
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,639
five different lines in the datab atase

451
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:33,519
from five different molecules all of

452
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,759
which agree with my measured frequency

453
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,639
within the

454
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,600
error now what do I do all right the

455
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,639
automated assignment algorithm would say

456
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,839
well I'm just going to pick the one

457
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,800
that's closest in frequency and move on

458
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,560
with my

459
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,600
life but that might not necessarily be

460
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,399
the right approach right and in fact a

461
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,800
lot of the time it is not and this is

462
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,440
where the hum has to come into play

463
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,880
right using what we call chemical

464
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,319
intuition now it's the last Talk of the

465
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,800
day and everybody is sleep so we're

466
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,280
going to do an interactive session here

467
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,880
all right so I'm going to tell you you

468
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,280
all have chemical intuition whether you

469
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,000
know it or not even if you haven't taken

470
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,360
chemistry since high school right

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,640
so here's a mixture I'm going to tell

472
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,160
you that these six molecules are known

473
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
to be present in a mixture right you've

474
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,679
done an analysis you know for certain

475
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,199
that they're there and now you're trying

476
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,839
to decide between two different possible

477
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,600
additional components that came up from

478
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,559
your analysis right is parole or is

479
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,080
vinyl alcohol more likely to be a

480
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,400
component of this mixture all right so

481
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,720
think about it for a second and then

482
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,919
we're going to

483
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,880
vote all right hands up if we think

484
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,000
parole is the more likely component of

485
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,120
this

486
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,760
mixture and for vinyl

487
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,240
alcohol

488
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,360
excellent why I didn't actually tell you

489
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,679
what any of these molecules were in fact

490
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,480
I didn't even label what the atoms were

491
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,360
now look the black one is carbon the

492
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,919
white one is hydrogen the red one here

493
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,240
is oxygen and the blue one is nitrogen

494
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,240
fine you didn't even need to know that

495
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,200
right because humans are really good at

496
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,799
pattern recognition right you either

497
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,159
consciously or not saw this o group over

498
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,720
here this alcohol group and said I see

499
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:22,559
that four other times up here I don't

500
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,240
see any ring systems in here right and

501
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,880
uh I see mainly two or three carbons so

502
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,919
this one is just a better match right

503
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,600
that is the same same kind of intuition

504
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,240
that we have as chemists of course I

505
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,240
would look at this and think alcohol

506
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,200
instead of just looking at the

507
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,559
structures but clearly just looking at

508
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,919
the structure

509
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,000
works that's something computers are

510
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,400
pretty good at right just looking at

511
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,799
structures and finding patterns all

512
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,799
right let's do one other one here it's

513
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:50,400
slightly trickier here's another mixture

514
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,520
six things right this time it's all

515
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,360
carbon and hydrogen I want you to decide

516
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:59,880
between decane here and cyclobutane

517
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,200
here think about for a

518
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,600
second hands up for

519
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,440
decane all right hands up for

520
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,799
cyclobutane all right that's about a

521
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,919
50/50 split and that's intentional these

522
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:18,880
are much closer right now if I had to

523
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,400
choose I'd choose the cyclobutane here

524
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
only because there is another ringed

525
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,960
system in that mixture already right

526
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,840
there's the three ring system up there

527
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,240
and most of what I have here have small

528
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,919
number of carbons but these are much

529
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,679
closer and much more similar to each

530
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,240
other than these right and there's

531
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,720
probably other dimensions here that my

532
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,280
chemical intuition is not like

533
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,360
distinctly identifying here right sort

534
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,159
of uh subliminal things that I'm just

535
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,600
sort of thinking about as I go through

536
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,760
that so what we want to do is we want to

537
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,480
be able to analyze an actual mixture and

538
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,400
apply chemical intuition to figure out

539
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,159
what the most likely choice is so if I

540
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,120
now tell you that this line from this

541
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,840
previous one came from a reaction

542
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,880
mixture that contained Benzene and

543
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,559
methyl cyanide here I you can identify

544
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,280
immediately what the correct carrier of

545
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,039
this line is it's Beno n trial B up

546
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,520
there on the right yeah that is again

547
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,440
chemical intuition so how do we train a

548
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,240
computer to do that right traditional

549
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,159
Computing methods for Loops logic gates

550
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,240
cannot do this right it's just not

551
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,400
possible to write a complex enough

552
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,240
algorithm to sort out chemical intuition

553
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,840
in this way so instead we're going to

554
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,200
use a machine learning approach to to

555
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,600
teach a computer to have some chemical

556
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,559
intuition so how are we going to do that

557
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,320
well we're going to do that by teaching

558
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:40,360
the computer the language of molecules

559
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,280
so we all did the recognition here by

560
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,280
looking at pictures right and computers

561
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,000
are fine at image recognition but

562
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,919
they're much better at working with text

563
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,360
right so turns out we can represent

564
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,200
molecules by unique strings called uh

565
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,440
smile strings or selfie strings these

566
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,480
are two different ways to do this right

567
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,600
the these are unique representations of

568
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,760
this molecule that encode encode the

569
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,120
elemental uh structure the composition

570
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,080
of the molecule and how they're bonded

571
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,400
together right so this actually makes up

572
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,240
if you think about it in terms of a

573
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,799
language right uh letters inside words

574
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,039
that make up a sentence that is the

575
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:23,600
molecule right so this is fine so what

576
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,960
we're going to do is we're going to use

577
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,720
natural language processing algorithms

578
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,320
to treat the structure of molecules as

579
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,080
sentences as language so we package all

580
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,679
of this stuff up and then we run it

581
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,279
through something called an autoencoder

582
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,559
here right the details of which don't

583
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,960
matter there's a bunch of these

584
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,840
different things here two of the most

585
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,919
common ones to use here are moltu and

586
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,679
viit gay uh these are again natural

587
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,960
language processing algorithms the same

588
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,440
sort of things that help Siri and Alexa

589
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,960
process your speech and turn it into

590
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,240
something meaningful and what it turns

591
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,440
out at the end is a vector

592
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,039
representation of the molecule right it

593
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,400
learns the language of molecules and it

594
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,960
says can represent this molecule as a

595
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,840
string of numbers those numbers

596
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,200
represent everything the computer has

597
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,200
learned about that molecule it's

598
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,240
position in chemical space you might say

599
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,240
right now these vectors can be dozens or

600
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,400
hundreds of Dimensions long so chemical

601
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,840
space can be dozens or hundreds of

602
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,720
Dimensions large but we can represent

603
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,799
then every single molecule as a position

604
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,000
in chemical Space by one of these

605
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,640
vectors and that means that molecules

606
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,720
that are chemical Al similar that the

607
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,520
computer has learned are chemically

608
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,400
similar should be nearby in chemical

609
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,400
Vector space so we could just look at

610
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,320
the distance between these vectors and

611
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,919
so it actually works right so if we

612
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,840
start with Benzene we can look at the

613
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,720
distance from benzon nitri it's not that

614
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,480
far away but it is going to be quite a

615
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,200
distance in Vector space from glycine or

616
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,840
from this travesty over here which

617
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,000
includes sulfur and multiple oxygen

618
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,600
atoms on there right so it gives us a

619
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,919
numerical way to represent how closely

620
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,159
related in chem space these molecules

621
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,640
are to one another now what we want to

622
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,799
do is we actually want to graph that we

623
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,240
want to represent areas of chemical

624
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,120
space that are the most important for

625
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,200
the mixture at hand right and so we do

626
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,080
that by constructing an actual graph

627
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,520
where the nodes on the graph represent

628
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,159
all of the molecules that we could

629
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,279
possibly want to consider and they are

630
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,360
spaced so that molecules that are

631
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,080
similar to one another are very close by

632
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,039
we then connect those nodes to one

633
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,120
another so that molecules can share

634
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,120
important

635
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,039
so if we know that an area of chemical

636
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
space is important because molecules

637
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,159
have been detected in our mixture that

638
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,039
means that other molecules that are

639
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,720
nearby in chemical space should also be

640
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,400
important and the size of the nodes is

641
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,480
going to represent the relative

642
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,960
importance right so these graphs that we

643
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,799
built so far are hundreds of thousands

644
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,520
to millions of molecules large we just

645
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,320
scrape databases of all molecules known

646
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,520
to or dreamt of by Humanity in code them

647
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,760
and generate a graph so how does this

648
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,400
actually work for us well I can look at

649
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,320
a small portion of this graph here and

650
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,120
there are actually tiny little dots here

651
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,200
representing the nodes that we start out

652
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,720
at none of them have any weight right

653
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,039
the molecules that are close enough to

654
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
each other in chemical space are

655
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:13,840
connected by these conduits that allow

656
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,400
them to share importance and what we do

657
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,720
is we say well maybe we know something

658
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,799
about our mixture maybe we know we

659
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,640
started with Benzene and furan so we

660
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,360
give a lot of weight to those nodes to

661
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,320
start with and then we let the network

662
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,880
relax we let weight from these nodes get

663
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,799
shared with the other nodes that are

664
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,279
connected with with it and then those

665
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,919
nodes that are connected with it share

666
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,720
their weight at a lesser and lesser

667
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,200
degree until the whole network has

668
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,080
burned in we run it thousands of

669
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,520
iterations until the network stops

670
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,679
changing until we've built a graph that

671
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,960
represents what our mixture looks like

672
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,760
in chemical space and this is going to

673
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,720
be our chemical intuition because we

674
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,559
know that things that are nearby in this

675
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,960
graph are chemically similar and the

676
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:55,480
computer can do this so how does it

677
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,960
actually work in practice well here's a

678
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,200
spectrum that we've taken a rotational

679
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,159
Spectrum in the laboratory we run a peak

680
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,919
finding algorithm this is instantaneous

681
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,279
traditional Computing to find all of the

682
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,039
lines their frequencies and intensities

683
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,360
and then we go line by line we pick the

684
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,480
strongest one so 8315 we query a

685
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,480
database and say these are all of the

686
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,080
molecules that have a transition in the

687
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,799
database within the error this is the

688
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,480
point where a human would look at them

689
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,640
and try to make a chemical intuition

690
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,159
assessment but now we don't have to now

691
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,360
we just ask our graph what is the

692
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,960
relative weights of these three

693
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,520
different molecules in chemical space

694
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,799
and then we can apply traditional

695
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,559
scaling metrics to that how close is

696
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,600
that line match in frequency to our

697
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,600
measured line right and we can apply

698
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,840
those intensity matches as well right

699
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,960
are there other lines that should be

700
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,840
present that are or are not and past

701
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,520
that if any of these molecules reach a

702
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,720
certain threshold well we assign the

703
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,520
highest molecule score to be present in

704
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,760
the

705
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,320
mixture but this is great now we know

706
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,000
something else about our mixture we can

707
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,480
feed that back into the graph and we

708
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
update the graph again because because

709
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,640
now we have more information about

710
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,440
what's there we've evolved our chemical

711
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,559
intuition and then we go back to the

712
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,640
next line and we repeat this over and

713
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,039
over and over and over and every time we

714
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,000
add a new molecule we recheck every

715
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,799
prior assignment so that we make sure

716
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,840
that what we know at the end matches

717
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,279
what we knew at the beginning right so

718
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
we are always checking for prior errors

719
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,279
so how does this actually work well we

720
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,480
were lucky we have colleagues up at

721
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,360
Harvard that ran a number of mixture

722
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,440
experiments using microwave spectroscopy

723
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,640
that we weren't involved in which was

724
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,039
great so they had huge data sets

725
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,559
hundreds of lines hundreds of species

726
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,200
they had gone through the painstaking

727
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,080
process of manually assigning all of

728
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,799
them weeks and weeks and weeks of humans

729
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,399
looking at this data so we knew the

730
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,039
correct answer and we fed this algorithm

731
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,360
which we call a maze here because that's

732
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,320
what my graduate student wanted to call

733
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,880
it right that information and said

734
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,320
assign these mixture components so we

735
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,000
did three different mixtures one where

736
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,399
they just blew up Benzene on its own

737
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,279
this generated 406 signals in their

738
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:01,919
range of interest and a maze managed to

739
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:04,279
assign it with 97%

740
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,279
accuracy this is better than the human

741
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,399
spectroscopist did we corrected

742
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,120
misassignments the human made we went

743
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,480
back and looked at what the machine

744
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,600
suggested and the Machine was correct

745
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,080
more often than not this took a human

746
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,440
weeks this took the computer 14 minutes

747
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,799
right orders of magnitude Improvement in

748
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,200
the speed and it wasn't just a fluke

749
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,720
there were also data sets here we blew

750
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,799
up Benzene with nitrogen and Benzene

751
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,600
with oxygen and came out with even

752
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,360
higher degrees of accuracy it turns out

753
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,559
if you have more and more signals it's

754
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,360
harder and harder to make mistakes right

755
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,360
we're approaching perfect accuracy here

756
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,240
and we actually understand why the

757
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,200
misassignments it's being made are being

758
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,000
made right and we're able to do it here

759
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,440
in at most 29 minutes in fact uh you

760
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,880
know we're not computer programmers this

761
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,440
is a chemistry graduate student and

762
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,679
chemistry professor we've made a few

763
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,200
improvements to the code and we can get

764
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
this down to about 10 minutes now for

765
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,480
one of them um but if we had an actual

766
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,760
computer scientist on this we could get

767
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,840
it down much faster right but weeks to

768
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,159
minutes

769
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,519
right it's incredibly good and it's

770
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,039
incredibly accurate right and this

771
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:10,440
actually is now doing what you see in

772
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,039
CSI or bones you put a sample into an

773
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,720
instrument you take the microwave

774
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,159
spectrum and you feed it into the

775
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,760
algorithm and it assigns the components

776
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
right as long as they are known as long

777
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,679
as they are in a database so in my last

778
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,640
few minutes I want to talk about what

779
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,159
happens here on this second portion

780
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,880
iding unknown components this is a much

781
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,080
harder question right how do we figure

782
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,760
out what's there when we don't know

783
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,399
what's there unknown unknowns well it

784
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,159
turns out we can actually use our graph

785
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,000
our knowledge of chemical space now that

786
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,200
we've built up to make highly informed

787
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,320
suggestions about what might be there

788
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,080
for us to look at really really reduce

789
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,159
that time and human intervention it

790
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,399
takes to think about the problem so this

791
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,559
is where I'll give you an example from

792
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:52,799
my own research again I said uh

793
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,480
previously I looked at this Source

794
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,480
called tmc1 This is a cold Dark Cloud 10

795
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,640
degrees above absolute zero of gas and

796
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,320
dust in the constellation of Taurus this

797
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,399
is a place that stars will eventually

798
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,320
form but they haven't started yet and I

799
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,720
use the green Bank telescope here in

800
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,840
West Virginia to measure its spectrum

801
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,440
and this is the Spectrum we got back out

802
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,799
I challenge you to find a difference

803
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,320
between this spectrum and the one in the

804
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,960
laboratory they look very similar

805
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,240
because they are the same it's a

806
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,080
chemical mixture and this is the

807
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,559
rotational spectrum of all the molecules

808
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,279
in it so what we did was we fed this

809
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:29,960
spectrum to a maze and we asked it to

810
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,880
assign almost everything in it we

811
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,760
tricked it a little bit we only let it

812
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,159
assign the 200 or so strongest signals

813
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,640
and didn't let it operate on some of the

814
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,880
weaker ones and we also intentionally

815
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,559
withheld a number of molecules we knew

816
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,799
to be present we just made it think they

817
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,320
weren't in the database we removed them

818
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,960
right so they were fake

819
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,399
unknowns so this worked really well it

820
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,840
again about 98% accuracy nailed all of

821
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
the things that were there did it in

822
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,919
about about 10 minutes but then we asked

823
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:07,039
it well you have a graph at the end you

824
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,080
can rank based on your chemical

825
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,320
intuition what other molecules are

826
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,399
likely to be present and so what we did

827
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,039
was we looked at all of the molecules we

828
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:19,600
withheld our graph had 300,000 species

829
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,159
in it and we wanted to know what was the

830
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,720
rank the suggestion of all of the

831
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,080
molecules we knew to be present but we

832
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,600
had

833
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,240
withheld well it ranked one of them

834
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,720
number two as the second most likely

835
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,200
molecule to be out there based on its

836
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,320
intuition and the worst one was hanging

837
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,559
out here down in the bottom at number 92

838
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,679
it had no knowledge of the spectroscopy

839
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:43,720
of these molecules we fed it nothing

840
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,919
about our chemical intuition it just

841
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,519
said out of the 300,000 molecules in

842
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,440
this network these molecules are in the

843
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,919
top 100 and these are species we all

844
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,799
know to be we know already are present

845
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,480
in this Source we know the correct

846
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:01,679
answer so it's doing an incredible good

847
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,840
job at narrowing down the range of

848
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,760
inquiry that we have to use to do this

849
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,679
search for unknown components right now

850
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,200
of course we can think can we then feed

851
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,360
that into some other sort of machine

852
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Learning Network and generate molecules

853
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,000
or have it automatically run experiments

854
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,760
and that's where we're going next right

855
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,559
but already this is a huge Improvement

856
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,480
in the amount of time it takes to do

857
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,880
this unknown component

858
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,840
analysis so I'll just wrap up here by

859
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,519
saying that okay we're never going to

860
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,080
actually measure and identify card and

861
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,960
 and Tamarind in here right that's

862
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,559
that's a pie in the sky dream but we

863
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,279
actually are at the point where we can

864
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,159
feed a maze a spectrum and it can return

865
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,720
in minutes the actual chemical

866
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,960
components with incredibly high accuracy

867
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,760
and in fact better than a human

868
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,600
scientist could actually do uh so I'll

869
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,799
wrap up there by acknowledging my group

870
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,039
and especially Zack freed here graduate

871
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,720
student uh who is now in his fourth year

872
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,880
who did basically all of the work for

873
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,279
this he's absolutely incredible um

874
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,679
funding sources and how you can get in

875
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:01,080
touch with me online if you want and I'm

876
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,080
happy to answer any questions you might

877
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,900
have thanks for sticking to the end of

878
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,359
the

879
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,359
[Applause]

880
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,440
day any questions from the

881
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,200
audience and if all you want to do is go

882
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
to the reception I won't be offended

883
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,279
if you're doing spectral why don't you

884
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,840
have to do the red shift to do the

885
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,399
comparisons so for Interstellar sources

886
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,799
you do have to correct for the red shift

887
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:43,919
that is absolutely true um and so what

888
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,120
we do I mean just in general is that you

889
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,760
observe carbon monoxide it's the second

890
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,760
most abundant molecule in the universe

891
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,600
has an incredibly well-known and

892
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,720
Incredibly sparse rotational Spectrum it

893
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,360
is always the strongest line in there so

894
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,799
we go look in the frequency range where

895
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,720
it's going to be because we can

896
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,720
generally guess what the Doppler shift

897
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,480
will be in the regions of our galaxy

898
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,960
find that line see how much it shifted

899
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,600
by and then assume that all the other

900
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,840
gas is moving by that amount too that

901
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,000
gets Us close enough that we can then

902
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,360
dither around and identify the last ones

903
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,039
um that's actually one of Zach's most

904
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,679
recent innovations that was also

905
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,840
something we had to do manually that

906
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,399
Zach can now use machine learning tools

907
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,880
to do automatically um so this is uh

908
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,159
something that we're going to to work

909
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,279
with the national radio astronomy

910
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,440
Observatory to incorporate into the data

911
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,279
products that the NSF facilities provide

912
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,559
to to astronomers to make this

913
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,559
determination of Doppler shift

914
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,399
automatic thanks um what is your

915
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,080
research more focused on or your

916
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:52,039
personal interest is it capabilities of

917
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,880
spacecraft forms of life uh the you know

918
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:56,919
composition of surfaces Etc composition

919
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,799
of inter Cellar clouds that's the big

920
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:03,720
one um so this cold Dark Cloud of gas

921
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:06,120
and dust tmc1 um this is where a star

922
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,960
will eventually form so this is a we we

923
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,200
think representing the kinds of material

924
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,599
that our solar system formed out of

925
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,520
billions of years ago um it turns out

926
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,520
that based on a bunch of circumstantial

927
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,159
evidence there's strong uh strong

928
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,240
indications that about a quarter of all

929
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,679
carbon in the universe is in the form of

930
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,200
what are called polycyclic aromatic

931
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,240
hydrocarbons they're these ringed

932
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,320
molecules like Benzene but with many

933
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,079
many more Rings fused together and we've

934
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,480
had strong evidence for that but

935
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,560
circumstantial uh since the 1980s in the

936
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,159
infrared uh and the discovery that my

937
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,200
group made a few years ago was that

938
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,240
using rotational spectroscopy we have

939
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,280
detected individual PHS for the very

940
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,359
first time in this cold Dark Cloud tmc1

941
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,960
confirming that yes these molecules are

942
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:52,079
present they carry an incredible amount

943
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,919
of the carbon but one of the really cool

944
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,119
things is that the phes that we're

945
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:58,880
seeing In This Cloud at 10 Kelvin

946
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,160
particularly two of them uh called

947
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,560
napthalene and Pyne they're the same

948
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,200
phes that were recently detected um by a

949
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,280
sample return mission to asteroid ryugu

950
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,079
in our own solar system sent out a

951
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,760
spacecraft picked up a sample of this

952
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:14,839
asteroid brought it back analyzed it

953
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,560
here on Earth and they found napthalene

954
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,119
and pyrene and in fact the isotopic

955
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,200
analysis here on Earth indicated that

956
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,760
napthalene and pyrene formed at 10

957
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,400
Kelvin right which I think is incredibly

958
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,160
cool it tells us that the chemistry

959
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,760
that's happening in this cold Dark Cloud

960
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,280
before the star even turns on is

961
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,960
probably preserved to a degree

962
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,560
throughout the entire incredibly violent

963
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,280
process of forming a star and forming

964
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,560
planets it also tells us that the

965
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,680
chemistry of our solar system was

966
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,640
probably set in no small part by the

967
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,760
chemistry occurring at 10 Kelvin in that

968
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,480
cold Cloud that we formed from right one

969
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,680
of these direct links and because ph's

970
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,640
are so abundant that means that they're

971
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,560
carrying a huge amount of the carbon the

972
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,079
carbon that makes up us right that is

973
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,480
essential for life so that's my primary

974
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,400
interest is figuring out what these

975
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,520
other carbon bearing molecules are out

976
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,760
there and how they evolve alongside this

977
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,760
process of forming stars and

978
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,440
planets any

979
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,119
questions just one last one and we can

980
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,040
take it offline if you need um are there

981
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,359
any other data cleaning processes you

982
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,079
have to do that are major um that you'd

983
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,640
like to talk about yeah so it depends on

984
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,359
where you got your data source from so

985
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,520
if you're in the laboratory one of the

986
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:35,920
biggest things is instrumental artifacts

987
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,319
right so our instruments don't always

988
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,119
produce a clean Spectrum you can get

989
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:40,480
Spurs mixing in from different frequency

990
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,200
sources whether or not your frequency

991
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,800
source is pure or not um contaminants in

992
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,680
your actual chamber leftovers from

993
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,640
previous experiments and those sorts of

994
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,319
things again we can do with comp

995
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,319
traditional computational approaches we

996
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:54,520
can write some logic gates to remove

997
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:56,960
those the astronomical data is much

998
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,119
harder to clean right and the problem is

999
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,359
because in a laboratory we can very

1000
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,720
precisely control the conditions that

1001
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,800
we're under in space we can't do

1002
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,160
anything all we can do is passively

1003
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,440
watch and we get everything along that

1004
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,839
line of sight to us and our source so if

1005
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,440
there are other intervening clouds

1006
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,920
between us and there which happens

1007
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,240
sometimes you have multiple Doppler

1008
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,560
shifts right so you see multiple lines

1009
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,599
of the same molecule all overlapping on

1010
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,599
one another right if there's actually a

1011
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,280
star there some of the material is being

1012
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:25,839
accreted by the star and so depending on

1013
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,440
the orientation that you're seeing it

1014
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,280
you'll get these weird tail tailes in

1015
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,000
Doppler shift space where you're seeing

1016
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,240
the infall of the material as it's

1017
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,640
pulled onto the star that can cause

1018
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,599
problems you can also get weird

1019
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,200
absorption features from molecules at

1020
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,000
different temperatures between you and

1021
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,720
your Source all of these things are

1022
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,280
challenging to clean out um but they are

1023
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,720
part of the process and and again part

1024
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,119
of the algorithms that that Zach is

1025
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,040
putting together for that it's much

1026
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,200
easier if you have it here on Earth in

1027
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,200
the laboratory

1028
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,870
okay thank you very much professor

1029
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,870
[Applause]
