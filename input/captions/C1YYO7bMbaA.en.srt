another type of quantum computer is a

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,080
Quantum simulator a processor that

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,080
simulates the behavior of a physical

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,440
system a chemical reaction or a

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,880
biological process it's estimated that

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,799
somewhere between 1 and 2% of worldwide

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
energy production is used to produce

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,080
ammonia for agricultural fertilizer the

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,240
key step is a process called nitrogen

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,199
fixation which requires both high

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,880
pressure and high temperature in

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,640
contrast there exist bacteria which even

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,160
at room temperature can catalyze

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,360
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia how do

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,399
the bacteria do it well we don't really

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,040
know precisely simulations with

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,360
classical computers only provide

18
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,160
approximate answers on the other hand a

19
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,160
Quantum simulation would provide the

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,120
reaction energies that are involved in

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
the nitrogen fixation this type of

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,640
quantum chemistry simulation has many

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,800
applications for example developing new

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
pharmaceutical drugs or tailoring a

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,879
