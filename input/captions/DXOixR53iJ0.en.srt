1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,119
Um, our next speaker is, uh, Tito. Um,

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
sorry, Kristoff Reinhardt. Um, and I'm

3
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
gonna again let you introduce yourself.

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,519
>> Okay. I think

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
>> Oh, you got it. You're all set.

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,519
>> Thanks a lot, Zay. Good morning,

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,360
everybody. Uh, great pleasure to be

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,079
here. Thanks a lot to all of you for

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,079
taking the time uh to learn about this

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
important topic. And as Zanab said, we

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,559
all have to get involved in this and

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,559
become active. Uh I didn't learn how to

13
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,559
use a corkbang from Zanap. I learned

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,239
that from my uh father-in-law with whom

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,120
I've done a lot of building renovations

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,280
over the years. Uh but I'm meeting Zanab

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
regularly over the past year on Pi Days

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
and other events to eat a lot of pie. So

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,280
I think you only know me with a serious

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,520
sugar rush. And uh so let's see where I

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,920
have my remote control here. Yeah, I

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
think that fits really well. Basically

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,840
Jay uh talked about the whole planet and

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,000
the effects of various actions on the

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
planet and I tried to make the jump from

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,920
the planet to the individual building

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,200
and what this means for an individual

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,119
building owner. So uh I'm really excited

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,439
about the slides since last week a

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,320
little less so but uh what we put

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,680
together basically that as of April of

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,799
last year we had a spectacular

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,439
148 countries that represent 90% of the

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,640
world's population and 90% of the

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,079
world's GDP that had jointly said it's a

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,720
good idea to decarbonize our industry

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,040
our world and if we think about in what

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,520
kind of incredibly polarized times we

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
live and I guess last week shows that

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,799
there are h bumps in the road towards

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
this joint goal but uh that there's an

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,280
incredible buyin here uh towards this

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,439
idea of having a net zero global economy

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,399
and I would call this goal really really

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,879
radical and the reason why is because

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,840
it's so different from what we have been

47
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,440
doing and not a lot of people know this

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,959
I only came across that a couple of

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,599
years ago it's really worthwhile looking

50
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,400
this up this uh 1952 pi commission

51
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,239
resources for freedom that was a report

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,080
that I would say was really the moment

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,080
that defined global attitude towards

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
economic growth fossil fuels and so

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,879
forth. This was done uh by a set of

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,080
experts was really widely published the

57
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,879
paley commission was by the uh headed by

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,120
the president of the CBC paley and

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,200
basically the sentence at the bottom is

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
really key. It says that permanent

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,480
economic growth powered by cheap fossil

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,480
fuels of arbitrary origin is the

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,120
overarching political priority of the

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
20th century. And if you think about it,

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
it's hard to think of any policy that

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,800
has been like implemented with more

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
vigor over such a long period of time.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
And so that in the face of this, we want

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,560
to change here is really remarkable. Of

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,720
course, we really don't want to get rid

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,720
of our energy use. We want to get rid of

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,800
the related carbon that's related to the

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,720
energy. But um it's still it's a big

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
change. What are the drivers between

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,080
these change? Well, in a way we heard

76
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,760
about it already. Uh there's lots of um

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
disasters happening worldwide. There's

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
just political momentum building and

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,080
organizations such as heat obviously

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,159
provide solutions towards this global

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
kind of initiative to say we want to

82
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,720
basically change the ways we deal with

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,519
our planet. I would say a key driver is

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,720
also that cities uh a lot of cities are

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,519
located near uh the sea and due to sea

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
level rise we see cities becoming so

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,560
much under pressure that they're

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
disappearing. I'm not you sure if you

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,360
followed that Jakarta is the first mega

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,360
city who announced that they're going to

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
move Jakarta. There won't be any Jakarta

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
anymore. The reason is sea level rise

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
overuse of groundwater in the city. So

94
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,159
they just there are some dramatic photos

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,920
out there that I didn't want to share

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,360
due to our open course reference. I'm

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,439
not even sure if I'm allowed to show

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,000
this graph here from the New York Times,

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,440
but it's very dramatic what is going on

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,280
there. And then finally, of course, uh

101
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,440
we hear that all the time more and more

102
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,320
extreme weather events are happening.

103
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,400
This graph put we put together a couple

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,440
of months ago that basically looks at

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Noah's recorded extreme weather events.

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,360
Wow. Uh over the last um uh over the

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,360
last 70 years and 90% of these events

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,520
opened have happened in the last decade.

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
So it's really uh dramatic what is

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,360
happening and I've been told I have to

111
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,080
speed up. So now I try to make this

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,360
jump. How do we get basically from our

113
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,960
goal of uh these are of reducing uh the

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,720
temperature keeping global temperature

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,080
rise let's say under two degrees C

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:04,320
whatever our goal is then we know we

117
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,039
have 90 930 gigatons of CO2 left to make

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,000
the global building stock or the global

119
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,919
economy carbon neutral really if we are

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,919
releasing more carbon in the atmosphere

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,479
it's going to get warmer so if we now

122
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,960
say okay the building stock can take 40%

123
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,840
of this then an easy number to remember

124
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,440
is that we have 340 gigatons and 30

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,240
years left to make the global building

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,800
stock carbon neutral. Now this is our

127
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,639
budget where can we spend our budget on?

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,639
It's basically the projections are that

129
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,840
the global build area is going to double

130
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,000
by 2050. So this is our budget and this

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
is where we have to spend it on. This is

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
a simple graph that shows three

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,400
predictions of what we could do to the

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
global building stock. Business as usual

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,479
says 1% renovation rate globally. Uh

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,120
this is what we currently have and by

137
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,919
2050 we will have net zero solutions for

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
all buildings new and renovated. That's

139
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,759
is going to blow our budget

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,320
dramatically. Then the top of the orange

141
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,720
line shows what happens if we have in 10

142
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,240
years net zero new buildings for all new

143
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,000
construction and we increase the

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,680
retrofitting rate to five% per year.

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,319
That still doesn't get us fully there.

146
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,400
We also need to have by this point

147
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
embodied net zero. So all the energy

148
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
that goes into building the buildings,

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,600
we somewhat have to have net zero

150
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,680
technologies. We have zero ideas of how

151
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,440
to do that right now. But if we are

152
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,039
putting that together really I would say

153
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,400
there's a three-pronged approach of how

154
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,600
we're going to move the building stock

155
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,600
around. One is again 5% renovation rate

156
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
per year. Within 10 years we need to

157
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
have carbon neutral solutions for all

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
new construction and for building

159
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,520
retrofits. And really I would really

160
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,680
question this terrible notion that we

161
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
have to double the build area like in

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,520
five in 30 years we're going to build

163
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,759
what uh what we have built in the last

164
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
5,000 years seems a terrible idea. So

165
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,520
more efficient space use is very

166
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,759
important as well. So since I have only

167
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
two years what techn I'm now trying to

168
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
take it down right to the individual

169
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
owner. So if you have a typical building

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,599
in New England right now in

171
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,800
Massachusetts, the main proposal that

172
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,960
you get is put PV on your rooftop and

173
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,840
put in an airsource heat pump. That's

174
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,440
really what Massachusetts is pushing.

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,000
And so if we look at that, what that

176
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,720
means is basically if you just in

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,400
isolation put in a heat pump that in the

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
best case scenario, unless you do it

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,639
yourself, cost you cost you about

180
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,639
$25,000.

181
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,800
And it's going to and that's important

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,759
if you're using natural gas right now

183
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,919
increase your operating costs. So really

184
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,400
from an economic standpoint the best you

185
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,840
can do is put a heat pump uh use an

186
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,840
airsource heat pump and a PV system. But

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
what what that happens if you are doing

188
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,120
that then of course very suddenly you

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
have a building that puts a really

190
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,720
strong strain on the grid because you're

191
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,199
creating the electricity in the summer

192
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,840
but you're having a new peak due to your

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,440
heat pump in the winter and so we don't

194
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,520
have any big battery lying around

195
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,879
somewhere so that is a key problem

196
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,280
overall and so what we should really do

197
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
and I know I'm nearly there is we have

198
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,360
to have a detailed an we have to offer

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
every homeowner like a whole series of

200
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,560
different choices that they can make

201
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,639
with LEDs, better appliances, retrofit

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,960
their building, PV putting in a heat

203
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,599
pump. This type of analysis we want to

204
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,039
do to give to every home owner. And in

205
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,720
order to reach this goal, we're working

206
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,800
with the state of Massachusetts right

207
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
now. We build a model at two and a half

208
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
million buildings. And the way this is

209
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,120
going to look like in a few weeks, you

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
can go to your building. You can set

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,159
what have I done to my building right

212
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,919
now? And then we're going to give you

213
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,839
estimates in terms of cost, carbon

214
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,599
savings and so forth what you can do.

215
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,600
Right now in the first instances we

216
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,440
probably have a airsource and ground

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
source heat pumps not a network but

218
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
these are things that we can kind of

219
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,840
introduce over time if there's interest.

220
00:08:51,839 --> 00:09:01,789
Thank you.

221
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:01,789
[Applause]
