the MIT energy initiative presents

00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,840
making aviation fuel from biomass a new

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,200
MIT technique could be the key written

by Nancy W

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,960
stoffer in 2021 nearly a quarter of the

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,279
world's carbon dioxide emissions came

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,400
from the Transportation sector with

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,960
Aviation being a significant contributor

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,960
while the growing use of electric

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,080
vehicles is helping to clean up ground

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
transportation today's batteries can't

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,920
compete with fossil fuel derived liquid

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,600
hydrocarbons in terms of energy

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,039
delivered per pound of weight a major

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,160
concern when it comes to Flying

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,960
meanwhile based on projected growth and

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,000
travel demand consumption of jet fuel is

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,840
projected to double between now and 2050

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,640
the Year by which the international

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
aviation industry has pledged to be

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,640
carbon neutral many groups have targeted

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,480
a 100% sustainable hydrocarbon fuel for

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,280
aircraft but without much success

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,280
part of the challenge is that Aviation

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,479
fuels are so tightly regulated this is a

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,479
subclass of fuels that has very specific

27
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,880
requirements in terms of the chemistry

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,479
and the physical properties of the fuel

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,960
because you can't risk something going

30
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,320
wrong in an airplane engine says Yuri

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,479
Roman leskov the Robert T Hassam 1911

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,799
professor of chemical engineering if

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,880
you're flying at 30,000 ft it's very

34
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,240
cold outside and you don't want the fuel

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,880
to thicken or freeze that's why the

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,320
formulation is very specific

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,119
aviation fuel is a combination of two

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,640
large classes of chemical compounds some

39
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,079
75 to 90% of it is made up of alaic

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,759
molecules which consist of long chains

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
of carbon atoms linked together this is

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,719
similar to what we would find in diesel

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,799
fuels so it's a classic hydrocarbon that

44
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,680
is out there explains ran leskov the

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,680
remaining 10 to 25% consists of aromatic

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,759
molecules Each of which includes at

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,240
least one ring made up of six connected

48
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,920
carbon atoms in most Transportation

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,079
fuels aromatic hydrocarbons are viewed

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,840
as a source of pollution so they're

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,840
removed as much as possible however in

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,360
aviation fuels some aromatic molecules

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,080
must remain because they set the

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,920
necessary physical and combustion

55
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,560
properties of the overall mixture they

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,200
also perform one more critical task they

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,879
ensure that seals between various

58
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,920
components in the aircraft fuel system

59
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,959
are tight the aromatics get absorbed by

60
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,560
the plastic seals and make them swell

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,000
explains Roman l cuff if for some reason

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,480
the fuel changes so can the seals and

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,280
that's very dangerous as a result

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,920
aromatics are a necessary component but

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
they're also a stumbling block in the

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,879
move to create sustainable Aviation

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,800
fuels or safs companies know how to make

68
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,159
the aliphatic fraction from inedible

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,920
parts of plants and other Renewables but

70
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,519
they haven't yet developed an improved

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,360
method of generating the aromatic

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
fraction from sustainable sources as a

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,080
result there's a blending wall explains

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,159
Roman leskov since we need that aromatic

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,280
content regardless of its source there

76
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,319
will always be a limit on how much the

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
sustainable aliphatic hydrocarbons we

78
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,239
can use without changing the properties

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,480
of the mixture he notes a similar

80
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,519
blending wall with gasoline we have a

81
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,440
lot of ethanol but we can't add more

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,360
than 10% without changing the properties

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,599
of the gasoline in fact current engines

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,959
can't handle even 15% ethanol without

85
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,080
modification no shortage of renewable

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,439
source material or attempts to convert

87
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,840
it

88
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,720
for the past 5 years understanding and

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
solving the saf problem has been the

90
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,760
goal of research by Roman leskov and his

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,560
MIT team Michael L stone PhD 21 Matthew

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,239
S Weber and others as well as their

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,640
collaborators at Washington State

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,360
University the national renewable energy

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,840
laboratory enr and the Pacific Northwest

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,519
National Laboratory their work has

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,360
focused on lignan a tough material that

98
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,120
gives plants structural support and

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,879
protection against microbes and fungi

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,200
about 30% of the carbon in biomass is in

101
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,280
lignan yet when ethanol is generated

102
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,480
from biomass the lignan is Left Behind

103
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,480
as a waste

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,400
product despite Valiant efforts no one

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,720
has found an economically viable

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,840
scalable way to turn liant into useful

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,600
products including the aromatic

108
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,320
molecules needed to make jet fuel 100%

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,120
sustainable why not as Roman leskov says

110
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,120
it's because of its chemical

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,720
recalcitrance it's difficult to make it

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,919
chemically react act in useful ways as a

113
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,039
result every year millions of tons of

114
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,400
waste ligant are burned as a lowgrade

115
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,160
fuel used as fertilizer or simply thrown

116
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,280
away understanding the problem requires

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
understanding what's happening at the

118
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,320
atomic level a single ligant molecule

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,680
the starting point of the challenge is a

120
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,800
big Macro Molecule made up of a network

121
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,400
of many aromatic rings connected by

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,199
oxygen and hydrogen atoms put simply the

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
key to converting lignan into the

124
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,919
aromatic fraction of saff is to break

125
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,880
that Macro Molecule into smaller pieces

126
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,800
while in the process getting rid of all

127
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,560
of the oxygen atoms in general most

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,280
industrial processes begin with a

129
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,720
chemical reaction that prevents the

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,000
subsequent upgrading of ligant as a

131
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,080
ligant is extracted from the biomass the

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,400
aromatic molecules in it react with one

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,080
another linking together to form strong

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,560
networks that won't react further as a

135
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,199
result the ligan is no longer useful for

136
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,039
making Aviation fuels to avoid that

137
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,520
outcome Roman Le Calin his team utilize

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,520
another approach they use a catalyst to

139
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
induce a chemical reaction that wouldn't

140
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,720
normally occur during extraction by

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,960
reacting the biomass in the presence of

142
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,880
a ruthenium based Catalyst they are able

143
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,919
to remove the lignan from the biomass

144
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,880
and produce a black liquid called lignan

145
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,560
oil that product is chemically stable

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,000
meaning that the aromatic molecules in

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,840
it will no longer react with one another

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,680
so the researchers have now successfully

149
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,560
broken the original lignan Macro

150
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,639
Molecule into fragments that contain

151
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
just one or two AR atic Rings each

152
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,600
however while the isolated fragments

153
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,800
don't chemically react they still

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,880
contain oxygen atoms therefore one task

155
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,639
remains finding a way to remove the

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,560
oxygen atoms in fact says Roman leskov

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
getting from the molecules in ligant oil

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,479
to the targeted aromatic molecules

159
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,759
required them to accomplish three things

160
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,599
in a single step they needed to

161
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,319
selectively break the carbon oxygen

162
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,720
bonds to free the oxygen atoms they need

163
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,960
to avoid incorporating non-carbon atoms

164
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,000
into the aromatic rings for example

165
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,240
atoms from the hydrogen gas that must be

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
present for all of the chemical

167
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,360
transformations to occur and they needed

168
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,720
to preserve the carbon backbone of the

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,720
molecule that is the series of linked

170
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,440
carbon atoms that connect the aromatic

171
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,120
rings that remain ultimately Roman

172
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,199
leskov and his team found a special

173
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,120
ingredient that would do the trick a

174
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,720
malum carbide

175
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,400
Catalyst it's actually a really amazing

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,280
Catalyst because it can perform those

177
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,800
three actions very well says Roman

178
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,560
leskov

179
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,039
in addition to that it's extremely

180
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,160
resistant to poisons plants can contain

181
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:09,280
a lot of components like proteins salts

182
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,800
and sulfur which often poison catalysts

183
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,039
they don't work anymore but malinam

184
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,000
carbide is very robust and isn't

185
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,520
strongly influenced by such

186
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,479
impurities trying it out on lignan from

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,199
popler

188
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,120
trees to test their approach in the lab

189
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,080
the researchers first designed and built

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,879
a specialized trickle bed reactor a type

191
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,879
of chemical reactor in which which both

192
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,720
liquids and gases flow downward through

193
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,000
a packed bed of catalyst particles they

194
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,120
then obtained biomass from a popler a

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,759
type of tree known as an energy crop

196
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,479
because it grows quickly and doesn't

197
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,479
require a lot of fertilizer to begin

198
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,720
they react the popular biomass in the

199
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,240
presence of the ranium base Catalyst to

200
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,800
extract the ligant and produce the

201
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,240
lignan oil they then flow the oil

202
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,319
through their trickle bed reactor

203
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,440
containing the malum carbide

204
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,120
Catalyst the mixture that formed

205
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,919
contains some of the targeted product

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,319
but also a lot of others that still

207
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,479
contained oxygen atoms Roman lesov notes

208
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,400
that in a trickle bed reactor the time

209
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,800
during which the lignan oil is exposed

210
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,520
to the Catalyst depends entirely on how

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,639
quickly it drips down through the packed

212
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,440
bed to increase the exposure time they

213
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,159
tried passing the oil through the same

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,240
Catalyst twice however the distribution

215
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,840
of products formed in the second pass

216
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,199
wasn't as they had predicted based on

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,240
the outcome of the first pass with

218
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,199
further investigation they figured out

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,440
why the first time the ligant oil drips

220
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,360
through the reactor it deposits oxygen

221
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,000
onto the Catalyst the deposition of the

222
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,919
oxygen changes the behavior of the

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,039
Catalyst such that certain products

224
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,159
appear or disappear with the temperature

225
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,240
being critical the temperature and

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,279
oxygen content set the condition of the

227
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Catalyst in the first pass says Roman

228
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,680
leskov then on the second pass the

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,279
oxygen content in the flow is lower and

230
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,640
the Catalyst can fully break the

231
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,440
remaining carbon oxygen bonds the

232
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,040
process can thus operate continuously

233
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,600
two separate reactors containing

234
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,800
independent Catalyst beds would be

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
connected in series with the first

236
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,200
pre-treating the ligant oil and the

237
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
second removing any Oxygen that remains

238
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,480
based on a series of experiments

239
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
involving ligant oil from popular

240
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,519
biomass the researchers determined the

241
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,680
operating conditions yielding the best

242
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,000
outcome 350° C in the first step and

243
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,920
375° C in the Second Step under those

244
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,760
optimized conditions the mixture that

245
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,560
forms is dominated by the targeted

246
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,480
aromatic process products with the

247
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,760
remainder consisting of small amounts of

248
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
other jet fuel aliphatic molecules and

249
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,040
some remaining oxygen containing

250
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,760
molecules the Catalyst remains stable

251
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,600
while generating more than 87% by weight

252
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,200
of aromatic molecules when we do our

253
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,000
chemistry with the mbum carbide Catalyst

254
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,200
our total carbon yields are nearly 85%

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,160
of the theoretical carbon yield says

256
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,720
Roman leskov in most lingin conversion

257
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,120
processes the carbon yields are very low

258
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,839
on the order of 10% that's why the

259
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,800
Catalyst Community got very excited

260
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,560
about our results because people had not

261
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,839
seen carbon yields as high as the ones

262
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,839
we generated with this Catalyst there

263
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,800
remains one key question does the

264
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,200
mixture of components of forms have the

265
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,800
properties required for aviation fuel

266
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,880
when we work with these new substrates

267
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,440
to make new fuels the blend that we

268
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,360
create is different from standard jet

269
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,600
fuel says Roman leskov unless it has the

270
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,440
exact properties required it will not

271
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,480
qualify for certification as jet fuel to

272
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,160
check their products Roman Lov and and

273
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,720
his team send samples to Washington

274
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,519
State University where a team operates a

275
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,079
combustion lab devoted to testing fuels

276
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,360
results from initial testing of the

277
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,639
composition and properties of the

278
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,000
samples have been encouraging based on

279
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,079
the composition and published

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
pre-screening tools and procedures the

281
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,959
researchers have made initial property

282
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,440
predictions for their samples and they

283
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,800
looked good for example the freezing

284
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,680
point viscosity and threshold sting

285
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,480
index are predicted to be lower than the

286
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,079
values for conventional aviation

287
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,079
aromatics in other words the material

288
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,560
should flow more easily and be less

289
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,639
likely to freeze than conventional

290
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,920
aromatics while also generating less

291
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,320
soot in the atmosphere when they burn

292
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,200
overall predicted properties are near to

293
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,279
or more favorable than those of

294
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,399
conventional fuel

295
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,920
aromatics next

296
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,880
steps the researchers are continuing to

297
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,440
study how their sample Blends behave at

298
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,399
different temperatures and in particular

299
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,519
how well they perform that key task

300
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,200
soaking into and swelling the seals

301
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,200
inside jet engines these molecules are

302
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,839
not the typical aromatic molecules that

303
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,079
you use in jet fuel says Roman leskov

304
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,480
preliminary tests with sample seals show

305
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,959
that there's no difference in how our

306
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,880
ligan derived aromatics swell the seals

307
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,680
but we need to confirm that there's no

308
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,120
room for error in addition he and his

309
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,800
team are working with their enal

310
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,040
collaborators to scale up their methods

311
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,920
enal has much larger reactors than other

312
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,760
infrastructure needed to produce large

313
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,000
quantities of the new sustainable blend

314
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,639
based on the promising results thus far

315
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,120
the team wants to be prepared for the

316
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,480
further testing required for the

317
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,760
certification of jet fuels in addition

318
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,480
to testing samples of the fuel the full

319
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,079
certification procedure calls for

320
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,680
demonstrating Its Behavior in an

321
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,600
operating engine not while flying but in

322
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,399
a lap clarifies Roman leskov in addition

323
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,279
to requiring large samples that

324
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,839
demonstration is both timec consuming

325
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,880
and expensive which is why it's the very

326
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,880
last step in the strict testing required

327
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,199
for a new sustainable aviation fuel to

328
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,920
be approved Roman leskov and his

329
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:31,320
colleagues are now exploring the use of

330
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,320
their approach with other types of

331
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,040
biomass including Pine switch grass and

332
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,600
corn Stover the leaves stocks and cobs

333
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,399
left after corn is harvested but the

334
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,760
results with popular biomass are

335
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,480
promising if further testing confirms

336
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
that their aromatic products can replace

337
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,600
the aromatics now in jet fuel the

338
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,920
blending wall could disappear says Roman

339
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,760
leskov we'll have a means of producing

340
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,279
all the components and aviation fuel

341
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,639
from renewable material potentially

342
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,880
leading to aircraft fuel that's 100%

343
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,760
sustainable
