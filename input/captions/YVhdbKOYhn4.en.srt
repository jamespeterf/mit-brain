1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,359
hi everyone Khan Waring CEO of skyline

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,879
nav AI we've had a long-standing

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:10,240
partnership with MIT my co-founder went

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,280
to um MIT in got his PhD from there so

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,799
at a high level um our background

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,600
expertise is in computer Vision

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,520
manufacturing patents Hardware

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,960
development and scaling and we have been

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
working primarily with clients in the

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,880
United States and Europe last week I was

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,320
actually in Taiwan that was one of our

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,840
first trips in Asia and we're looking

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,719
for um folks who are looking for GPS

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,800
independent navigation for cars trucks

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,960
drones aircraft that's what our subject

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,000
matter expertise is and then you might

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,200
ask well why do you need a GPS

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,640
independent

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,640
solution well there's many reasons why

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,079
first off uh if any one of you have

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,199
lived in complex terrains think of urban

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480
areas mountaneous regions uh you're

23
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:53,960
driving through tunnels highways uh

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,280
multi- Lev highways you may have

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,480
struggled with localization and so

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,559
challenge is you're connecting to the

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,280
satellite to get your location back uh

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,440
and it's not very efficient so that's

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,240
one of the reasons you want to think

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,880
about not just up GPS but fusing GPS

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,920
with other modalities such as the camera

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,000
um you you also have the situations

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,080
where GPS could be denied uh that's

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,159
happening right now in eastern Ukraine

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,280
and in Middle East uh it's being denied

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,320
spoofed um and so it's very challenging

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
for folks on the ground um when they're

38
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,880
doing regular things like getting from

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,520
point A to point B or opening up their

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
cell phones and not being able to get

41
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,720
the rides that they need on apps like

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,360
uber lift Etc so that's where we come in

43
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,520
we have solved the issue of GPS denial

44
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,640
and a GPS independent navigation system

45
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,479
that can work on ground and also in the

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,960
air and we estimate that if a technology

47
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,759
like ours was deployed at scale uh it

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,680
can help save people billions of dollars

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,000
a year in um a fewer um time that is

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
saved but also fuel costs uh that people

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
end up spending a lot of time on because

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,960
they don't have good localization so how

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,399
does our solution work well at a high

54
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,600
level we use the camera

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,759
and we also use the storage and compute

56
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,039
on board a car or a drone or an aircraft

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,000
and then that imagery is coming in as

58
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,680
you're moving from point A to point B we

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,160
have computer vision models that I'll

60
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,840
talk about in a second that are able to

61
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,920
pick up on different features around you

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,319
think of buildings think of mountains

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,319
think of trees think of Land Ocean you

64
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,080
you name it just like you and I as human

65
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,480
beings we can figure out where we are by

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
looking what's around us and comparing

67
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,640
that with map we do the same using

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,959
pre-computed pre-processed

69
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,280
two-dimensional and three-dimensional

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,440
satellite data sets so you download our

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
capability and it is designed to run on

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,080
the edge so there is no connectivity

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,480
required after you have the satellite

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,480
data sets and you have our algorithms

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,720
downloaded which we recommend doing it

76
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,440
at least once a year because things

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,480
around you don't change very often now

78
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,200
if there's been natural disasters think

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,680
of earthquake hurricanes Etc things will

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,640
change and that's where you want to

81
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,840
bring in the latest um data set around

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,319
you and so once you have it and we've

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,840
pre-computed pre-process everything

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,560
takes a few minutes now you're good to

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,000
go so as you're driving or flying the

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
camera is taking in visual information

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,560
comparing that with the pre-downloaded

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,560
satellite data sets and our algorithms

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,080
are able to give you a location back and

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,440
you can now navigate with or without

91
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,879
GPS so here's our secret sauce we have

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,000
different types of computer vision

93
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,319
models in the air and on the ground that

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,680
are able to deliver on these various

95
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,920
capabilities in fact you go to

96
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,799
skyline.com today and you can explore

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,680
the city of Chicago with no GPS we've

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,080
also just last night published our first

99
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,959
set of results uh we actually flew a

100
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,239
drone um in different parts of the US

101
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,000
and we are able to geolocate uh simply

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,640
by using the camera on the Drone this is

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
two-dimensional uh what you're seeing on

104
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,280
the left and then the city of Chicago is

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,760
using a Skyline train based approach and

106
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,120
you'll experience 95% of the time we can

107
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,760
get you 5 m or under on air or on ground

108
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,519
something we have also recently launched

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,239
is a semantic based approach where we're

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,720
able to pick up on different restaurants

111
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,480
and intersections and fuse that to give

112
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,159
you more accurate positioning so in this

113
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,879
picture this actually is um not at MIT

114
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,159
but at a competing school Harvard um and

115
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,040
we are able to pick up on different

116
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,280
intersections and restaurants and

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,880
businesses in that vicinity to tell you

118
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,759
hey this is where you are now imagine

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,720
the possibilities of having more

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
accurate positioning and navigation so

121
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,440
on the left you're seeing the current

122
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,680
day experience of urban Canyons and um

123
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,000
we have published a bunch of case

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,280
studies on our website San Francisco

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,039
Atlanta I experienced this in Taiwan

126
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,800
last week I've experienced this so many

127
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,039
times in Boston it's unbelievable right

128
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,400
so the big blue circle I call it that

129
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,320
big blue Circle of Death because you're

130
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,759
like where am I and how do I get to my

131
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,720
location um and on the right our

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,880
technology kicks in and simply using

133
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,479
camera we can get you 5 MERS or under

134
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,320
95% of the time and you fuse our

135
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,240
capability with inertial sensors and or

136
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,479
liar and then centimeter level accuracy

137
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,759
is also

138
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,360
possible so you can see on the left the

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
landbased results and how we able to

140
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,919
pick up on that and on the right you

141
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,080
have air based results again go to the

142
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,039
website you can play with our API um you

143
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,720
can play and see with the uh demo video

144
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,000
we've posted recently of the Drone

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
footage and our capability the beauty of

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,919
it is we've already trained the models

147
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,560
and it's ready to go worldwide uh we've

148
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,520
already proven it out in 40 regions

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,360
around the world and if there's a region

150
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,840
of interest that you have please reach

151
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,160
out and I'd love to work with you um you

152
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,080
can bring your own

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,440
or or we can fly out to you and and we

154
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,440
can uh prove our the capability Works uh

155
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,520
with you in action so how are customers

156
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,000
using our capability today so we are

157
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,720
working with large companies like BAE

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,560
Systems and care for so BAE Systems has

159
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,759
its own camera system and our capability

160
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,440
is running on top of that camera system

161
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,400
to do GPS Independence uh to do object

162
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,880
recognition and autonomy with k for

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,160
they're one of the Premier inertial

164
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,199
system companies and RK capability is

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,520
being fused with their inertial sensing

166
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,360
capabilities we have published the demo

167
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,160
of our ba systems collaboration so you

168
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,400
can go to our website and check it out

169
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,800
I'm also very excited to announce that

170
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,400
we have an

171
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,599
in-house design of a GL ground robot and

172
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,919
a drone which we actually manufacturing

173
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,199
right here in the United States we just

174
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,120
launched this you're actually one of the

175
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,919
first group of people to um learn about

176
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,319
it so it's called blade next and um

177
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,240
these are tactical robots and drones low

178
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,319
cost affordable uh the ground product is

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,080
$5,000 or under depending on the

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,759
configuration and we're offering the

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,039
drone at $2,000 or under depending on

182
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,000
different configuration and the model

183
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,440
type and it's running our software and

184
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,680
we've also added new features uh for

185
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,560
object recognition um and also for

186
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,199
autonomous operation from point A to

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,639
point B and most importantly uh these

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,319
products can navigate in a GPS denied

189
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,560
environment and they're secure encrypted

190
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,360
Mission ready um and so what we are here

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,479
for is we are seeking customers who have

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,759
case studies and and areas where you're

193
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,759
struggling with

194
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,160
localization and these are all the

195
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,919
different sectors but there could be

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,520
others as well that you're interested in

197
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,400
and we can help you solve that by using

198
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,319
the camera we just need three things

199
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,520
camera storage and compute and we can

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,479
make our software work through the API

201
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,319
and the SDK the API does require Cloud

202
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,280
connectivity but the SDK which is our

203
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,759
software is designed to run on the edge

204
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,759
with no connectivity requirement no

205
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,599
Wi-fi no cell no GPS I'm happy to answer

206
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,840
any questions you have thank

207
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,520
you thank you CER very much um so what

208
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,039
about um

209
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,800
fog and other elements that um could

210
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,440
complicate things a little bit excellent

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,759
question so with fog uh there's

212
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,879
certainly special cameras um that are

213
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,440
able to clear up the fog or even in snow

214
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,400
or windy conditions right so we are

215
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,000
relying on the camera uh that you have

216
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,800
installed on the on the edge and the

217
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,080
same thing applies even at nighttime so

218
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,680
you know if you have eoir cameras then

219
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,280
certainly we can pick up on that that's

220
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,479
actually been our collaboration with ba

221
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
system where our software is running on

222
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,440
top of an eir camera and can look

223
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,919
through at night so if you're using an

224
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,800
iPhone camera so we have an iPhone app

225
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,120
as well to demonstrate our capability

226
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,000
well these things won't work very well

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,280
in fog uh and also at nighttime unless

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
you have good lighting condition and so

229
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,000
that's the dependency we have on the

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,479
camera system that's why we tell fuse

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,240
our capability with Imus and liar if you

232
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,880
have available because then you have an

233
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,719
end to end solution that would work in

234
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,880
any type of

235
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,320
environment okay and tell us a little

236
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,600
more about the business model how are

237
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,240
you working with a corporate for example

238
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,959
yeah absolutely so typically clients

239
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,160
would come in and they would purchase

240
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,800
our API and SDK and we charge an annual

241
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,279
fee for that and we don't actually make

242
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,200
money off of the API SDK it covers our

243
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,320
engineering cost so we can ensure that

244
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,079
our product is working with your

245
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,560
Hardware configuration so if you have

246
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,360
specific camera types well it's probably

247
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,240
going to require some calibration on our

248
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,720
side to make it work and so that's all

249
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,120
covered in the API and the SDK and for

250
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,680
every car truck drone aircraft that you

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,640
install our capability on um we charge

252
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,480
you a small license fee uh and it can be

253
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,720
uh negotiable uh for example we're

254
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,360
talking to a company right now that

255
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,680
wants to put our stuff on 10,000 drones

256
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,079
next year right so they're not paying

257
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,519
the full retail price and we're

258
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,399
negotiating and we have come to a

259
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,200
conclusion on what that's going to look

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
like um so that's what we're interested

261
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,760
in you know automobile manufacturers

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
drone manufacturers if you're interested

263
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
in incorporating we'll work with you and

264
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,279
we'll uh would love to have our

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:46,000
technology integrated thank you very

266
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,000
much of course my pleasure thank you
