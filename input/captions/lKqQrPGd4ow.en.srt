1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,640
So, one thing is this diagnostic toolkit

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,160
for bipolar disorder

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,960
um that I sort of mentioned. Um I think

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,680
that's a really important project in the

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,439
lab. Um, I think that

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,960
I love this ability that we can

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,199
constantly push our tools um into new

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,640
areas because it means that we always

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:34,559
get the first look and um and I I think

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,160
that

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,399
uh it's also been a very very powerful.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,399
So, you know, I I have people who come

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,760
to my lab and what they want to train in

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,399
is on the using these imaging tools and

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,640
then they go get jobs and basically they

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,280
say, "Oh, I'm I did this on a not on a

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
knockout for a certain gene, but I could

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
do this on any Alzheimer's model." You

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,320
know, they get the job, right? Because

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,400
it's such a powerful tool

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
and you get to use it in a disease

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,479
model.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,479
Um, so, so I think that that's I I think

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,799
it's a powerful tool because it's a

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,159
discovery tool and it gives us insight

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,759
into how things work normally, but it's

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,640
also a very powerful tool to probe um

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,200
dysfunction. Well, you know, the cancer

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,880
field has really been revolutionized by

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,840
this ability to do um kind of

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,280
personalized genetics where you could

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,240
actually take a sample of the tumor,

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,479
find out exactly what the mutation is,

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,720
and predict whether a certain treatment

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,600
will work or not. And that has been

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,479
really um very uh kind of heavily

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,119
commercialized at this point.

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:00,159
Um but nobody's really done that for

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,079
neuroscsychiatric disorders

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,759
and if you compare the number of people

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,560
that are affected the numbers are huge

42
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,319
right so for example the prevalence of

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,319
bipolar disorder which is actually the

44
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,959
most genetically penetrant of all uh um

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,120
neuroscychiatric disorders it's 1 to 2%

46
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,920
of the population

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,000
Um, but when people have cancer, not all

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
cancers are the same. So each specific

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,080
cancer has a different diagnostic,

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,080
right? So that's a much smaller fraction

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
in comparison to the fraction of the

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,440
population that has bipolar disorder.

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,959
And if you ask a clinician, well, if I

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,360
gave you a test for bipolar disorder,

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
who would you test? and he said, "First

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,560
of all, any adolescent that's beginning

57
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,120
to show behavioral symptoms, obviously

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,599
you would test. If there's anybody in

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
the family that has a history, I would

60
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,480
test the entire family, including all

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,879
the kids. I would test anyone who comes

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,800
into my office that has depression

63
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,840
because it could be that it's just the

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,000
first symptom of bipolar disorder. So in

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,080
terms of the fraction of the population

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
where a test like this could be useful,

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
it's just

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,519
orders of magnitude higher than any

69
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,640
diagnostic test that exists today. And

70
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,800
those only exist actually there there

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,879
it's not true. It's the cancer field is

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,440
an area where that's been very um

73
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,920
successfully implemented. There are some

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,840
diagnostic related to um um

75
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,519
transplantation to ability to uh um

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,200
accept transplants and which ones but uh

77
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,760
but that's kind of it. Um, so I think

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,840
that the potential is really huge. And

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,959
and you know, also if you know anyone

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,799
who has bipolar disorder, you you can

81
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:07,360
see how debilitating it is. And um, you

82
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,799
know, and many of these people are

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,760
brilliant, right? And this totally

84
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,160
derails their life and it derails the

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,160
life of their entire family, right? It's

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,720
it's a huge huge um

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,759
kind of unmet need to be able to even

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,479
diagnose it. And the diagnosis is really

89
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,479
the first step towards appropriate

90
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,479
treatment.
