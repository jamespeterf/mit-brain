1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,359
So today uh we we set aside that part

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,720
and look at what is uh often the hardest

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,000
thing to actually make it real uh to put

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,800
in the around design, build, learn,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,079
research. So we get to work in a sense.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,760
Um and just like yesterday, uh there are

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,120
many people, experts, ideas that we

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,640
couldn't ram into this two-day session

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,920
in 10-minute segments. And so we are so

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,440
aware of that. There is still a

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,559
whiteboard

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,879
um with at the break you can add the

13
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,480
names of people and experts and ideas

14
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,960
that you really think need to be in

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,600
here. We may have attempted to get them

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,880
here. Um but we really want to hear that

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,360
from you as well as feedback. Um we're

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,040
trying to capture and share kind of a

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,000
pulse of information, the state of

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
knowledge. As you saw yesterday, there's

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,960
all kinds of views, all kinds of

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
perspectives, all kinds of voices and

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,640
language. and we just welcome them all.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,640
We're not saying that we shouldn't have

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,799
some healthy debates. Um, so I really

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,479
hope it goes as well today. And I want

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,770
to pass it over to uh Juliet who will be

28
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:42,320
moderating our very first session.

29
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:44,159
[Applause]

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,399
Hello everyone. Um we're excited to

31
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,640
start our day off with some talks about

32
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,799
design principles for geothermal energy

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
networks. We have three great speakers.

34
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
Um two of them in person and then one

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,159
online. So we'll start our day with

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,439
Connor Dwe uh who is a licensed engineer

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,680
at Geoys and who teaches an IGBA um

38
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,680
ground source heat pump course. Um,

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Connor,

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,080
>> okay, good morning everyone. Um,

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
so I I spoke with Zena before this this

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
meeting. I I just wanted to, you know,

43
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
thank all of HEAT for putting on the

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
session. and I left yesterday quite

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,640
optimistic on the geothermal district

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
space in the United States which is you

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,879
know it's it's very um relieving I'll

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,040
say with the with the times. So thank

49
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,480
you all for putting this on. So my my

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,319
background is in engineering uh I have a

51
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,239
doctor in what's called uh earth energy

52
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,640
resource engineering. I'm a licensed

53
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,640
engineer in the state of New York and

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,000
also uh the province of Ontario and

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,599
Canada. Um I also help teach the

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
certified geo exchange designer course

57
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,120
which is run by international ground

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,319
source heat seat pump association and

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,159
this specific slide deck today just goes

60
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,159
through that introductory level uh CGD

61
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,599
type type course. So we thought we'd

62
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,920
start with the fundamentals of heat

63
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,280
transfer uh to get into you know the

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
ground source heat pumps and and how

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,319
they work. So we have conduction,

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,720
convection and radiation. By definition,

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,560
conduction is when heat is directly

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,400
transmitted through a substance when

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,239
there is a difference in temperature. So

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,159
if you're holding a metal rod and that

71
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,760
metal rod heats up on one end, you feel

72
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,640
that heat through your hand through

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,799
conduction of that metal rod. We have

74
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,440
convection, which is the rising motion

75
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,000
of warmer areas of a liquid or gas and

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,159
the sinking motion of cooler areas of

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
liquid or gas. So if you're holding your

78
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,120
hand over a fire, you know that heat.

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,879
You're not physically touching anything,

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
but you feel that heat and that's that's

81
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,319
convection.

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
Lastly, we have radiation. The process

83
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,920
where heat energy is transferred from

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
one object to another through the

85
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
emission of electromagnetic waves. I

86
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,040
promise the rest of the rest the rest of

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,400
this presentation won't be this dry. Um

88
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
just getting through the fundamentals,

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
but when you're suntanning, you know,

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,360
you feel that heat, that's radiation.

91
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,080
Okay, so geothermal. What is geothermal?

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,400
While geo means relating to the earth

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,159
and thermal means relating to heat. So

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
the earth temperature is relatively

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,079
constant throughout the year, right?

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,840
It's around 50 here. I think it's 55

97
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
degrees Fahrenheit. Whereas in the

98
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,880
winter time it's 10° outside and then in

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,800
the summertime around 90° outside, but

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,360
the ground stays that same 50 55° F. And

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,040
to harness that energy, you can install

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,360
a ground heat exchanger, which is

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
plastic pipe that's buried in the ground

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,400
and it transfers heat to a volume of

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,800
earth around that around that pipe um

106
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,479
through various ways. You know, shallow

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
ground heat exchangers take advantage of

108
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,720
radiation, mainly conduction. Um but

109
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,639
there's also conve convective heat

110
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
transfer with that groundwater. You have

111
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,120
heat exchange fluid that's pumped

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
through the pipe. I'm getting used to

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,600
this laser here. heat exchange fluid

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,320
that's pumped through this pipe and then

115
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,880
connected to that heat pump. And the

116
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,960
reason why these systems are more

117
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,160
efficient is because of this sign graph

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,680
here. So the source temperatures going

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,639
to that heat pump from the ground heat

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,880
exchanger range between around 40 to 90

121
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,320
degrees Fahrenheit, sometimes as low as

122
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,720
30. But this specific graph is collected

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,280
from four years worth of data in a very

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,680
cold climate in in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

125
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,400
So during this same time period, the

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,560
outdoor air temperature ranged from -20

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,080
to + 100° F. So you can imagine that

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
getting your source temperatures from

129
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,120
the that more extreme uh you know air

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
compared to your ground heat exchanger

131
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,039
temperatures makes the heat pump work

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,840
harder. It has to work harder to deliver

133
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,800
that same amount of heat. Um so heat

134
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,080
pumps like to receive more moderate

135
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,039
temperatures so they don't need to work

136
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,360
as hard. And how a heat pump works is

137
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,960
just like a fridge, right? It's it's the

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
vapor compression cycle is what it's

139
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,320
called. It's no different than a fridge

140
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,759
other than a reversing valve. But the

141
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,520
the process is you have an evaporator

142
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,680
that transfers heat with your external

143
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,600
environment, right? So your air, your

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
ground or your water. You have a

145
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
compressor which compresses the

146
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,840
refrigerant and increasing the pressure

147
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
and temperature. Chemistry 101. If you

148
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,759
increase pressure, you increase the

149
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,520
temperature. You have your condenser

150
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120
which condenses the refrigerant vapor

151
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,360
into liquid and that phase change

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
transfers large amount of heat and then

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
your expansion valve to rinse and repeat

154
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
reduce the pressure and temperature to

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,560
prepare for the next cycle. So our our

156
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,560
ground source heat pump in heating again

157
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,639
we have this reversing valve which

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
differentiates our fridge from our our

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,600
heat pump. So we can also do heating be

160
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,319
strange if a fridge did heating. Um but

161
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,400
we extract heat from our ground loop

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,639
where we have three units of heat coming

163
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,199
from the ground. We have our compressor

164
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,680
which uses electricity to compress and

165
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,680
heat the refrigerant. That electrically

166
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,840
powered equipment generates heat as

167
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,520
well. Right? That's your power input.

168
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,560
That that compressor. There's also the

169
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,080
circulation pump and fans. And then you

170
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,919
give those four units of heat to the

171
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,160
building. Right? So that hot refrigerant

172
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,680
is pushed through the condenser and then

173
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,199
rejects that heat to the air in the

174
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,199
building. And this is how you get your

175
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,360
coefficient of performance. So you may

176
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
have heard the word coop or or

177
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,880
coefficient of performance. And this is

178
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,280
how it works. You you transfer those

179
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,919
four units of of energy which is

180
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,960
combined thermal and electrical energy

181
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,280
to the space by only using one by only

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,520
paying for one unit of electrical energy

183
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,599
to power that compressor circulation

184
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,880
pump and fans.

185
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,120
In cooling mode, we have our heat that's

186
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
extracted from the air in the building

187
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,720
vaporizing the refrigerant. So, those

188
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
three units of heat from the building,

189
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
we have our compressor again that

190
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
compresses the heat uh compresses and

191
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
heats the refrigerant. Our reversing

192
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,960
valve is on, right? So, we flip that

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,199
flow of refrigerant. So, it's going in

194
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,720
reverse now. And then that hot

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,280
refrigerant is pushed through the

196
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
condenser and rejects heat to that

197
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,440
ground heat exchanger. We need to get

198
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,280
rid of that electrical energy. an

199
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,960
electrical heat and the heat from the

200
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,960
building and we put that in the ground

201
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,879
loop. So what's the difference between

202
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,000
earth energy resource engineering or or

203
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,400
geothermal engineering and conventional

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
HVAC systems? Well, the the main

205
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,919
difference is that for ground source

206
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,599
heat pump systems, you should be

207
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,199
considering the total demand, right? the

208
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
total demand of a building, not just a

209
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
peak of the coldest day of the year or

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
the warmest day of the year, but your

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
total heating and cooling on an annual

212
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,320
basis to determine your total supply

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,839
because you're designing your source,

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,240
right? And so in a conventional system,

215
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,120
you have a pipeline that's large enough

216
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,040
to meet the peak heating day, the

217
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,279
coldest day of the year, right? You have

218
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,320
your natural gas pipeline that's feeding

219
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,200
that equipment. You have your water

220
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,200
utility line that's feeding your cooling

221
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,040
tower to dissipate heat on the warmest

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
day of the year. And as long as you pay

223
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,720
your energy bill, you should be okay.

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,760
But for a ground source heat pumps

225
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,600
scenario, we are also considered with

226
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,839
our our total loads, right? Again,

227
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
because we're designing our source. So

228
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,320
this example illustrates this. So we

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
have a church, a retail store, and an

230
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,040
apartment building. They may have the

231
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,560
exact same peak and and peak heating and

232
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,920
cooling loads, 40 tons of cooling and

233
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,320
385 MBH of heating, but due to the

234
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,320
difference in occupancy of those three

235
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,519
different buildings, the total heating

236
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
and cooling loads are going to change

237
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,920
quite dramatically, right? You think

238
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,920
about that church probably highly

239
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
occupied once or twice a week, right?

240
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
You have a lot of people in the room

241
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,720
like this space, you have a lot of

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,880
lights on. those internal heat gains

243
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,440
help uh heat the space and that's only

244
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,519
available maybe once or twice a week. So

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,839
your heating load over an annual um set

246
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,000
of of data is probably going to be

247
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,760
higher than than your cooling load.

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,920
Whereas your retail store, you know, you

249
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,200
could think of maybe an IKEA, you have a

250
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,080
lot of internal heat gains, a lot of

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,519
people, a lot of lights, a lot of um

252
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,519
internal heat gains that you need to get

253
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,000
rid of. So you put those in the ground,

254
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,079
right? you need to reject that heat and

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
the apartment building probably

256
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,920
relatively balanced between heating and

257
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,040
cooling. So the heating and cooling load

258
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
ratio can change even if the peak

259
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,040
heating and cooling loads are the exact

260
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,360
same. And how this affects the ground

261
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,880
loop and why it's important is because

262
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
and this is especially true for a

263
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,959
vertical ground heat exchanger scenario

264
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
with a lot of conduction, right? you

265
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,680
have a fixed volume of earth that you're

266
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,079
exchanging heat with and so it it's more

267
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,760
similar to a battery in in that case

268
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,839
compared to a conventional system there

269
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,200
there are nuances right and there are

270
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,000
you know each project is unique um but

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,839
even in openloop systems for example

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,839
where you're tapping into an aquifer and

273
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,399
pulling heat and rejecting heat to an

274
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,480
aquifer we've seen we've been measuring

275
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,240
a system in Winnipeg over the past uh 5

276
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,320
years or so and they've increased the

277
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,920
temperature of that aquifer by 5 to 8° F

278
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
um just because they're rejecting so

279
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,279
much heat into that aquifer. So what can

280
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,760
happen is this curve here, this

281
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,360
temperature drift where you may fall

282
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,360
outside of those efficient operating

283
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
parameters. When we talked about that

284
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,480
ground source heat pump, it likes to be

285
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,200
fed 30 to 90° Fahrenheit water, right?

286
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,279
But what can happen is you can fall

287
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,680
outside of those efficient operating

288
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
ranges if you're not considering your

289
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,920
total loads. if you're only looking at

290
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,720
your peak loads. So, it's important to

291
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,000
not only design again off of your your

292
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,240
peak loads, which are certainly

293
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,160
important, but your total loads are are

294
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,720
also important to determine your your

295
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:56,320
total demand to design your supply.

296
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,560
So, when you have a customer or anyone

297
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,320
frankly who's interested in a geothermal

298
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,120
system, where do you start? If they say,

299
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,040
"Hey, you know, Connor, I want I've

300
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,440
heard of this geothermal technology.

301
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,600
I've heard is pretty cool. Um, what do I

302
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
do? Well, you'd probably want to start

303
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,760
with the building, right? Again,

304
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,680
determine your total demand to determine

305
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,360
your supply. And then you can start

306
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,200
looking at your mechanical system, your

307
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,279
geothermal mechanical system, and your

308
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
site and geology. The site and geology

309
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,639
is going to dictate what type of ground

310
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
heat exchanger you go with. There's many

311
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,240
different ways to exchange heat with

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,800
your external environment. Again, all

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,639
you're doing is obtaining moderate

314
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,079
temperatures so that your heat pump

315
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,320
doesn't need to work as hard. So that

316
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,560
could come from the air. You know, in

317
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
Seattle, it's pretty moderate there. So

318
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,320
air source works fine. Um, but in

319
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,639
Winnipeg, in a cold climate like that,

320
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,240
not so much. So you could have a

321
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,800
vertical ground heat exchanger,

322
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
horizontal surface water, aquafer. I'm

323
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,120
staying at Susan Murkott's house right

324
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,040
now, and she's a professor here at MIT,

325
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,639
and she is a standing column, and that

326
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,800
was pretty interesting to see. So there

327
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
there's many different ways to give your

328
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,040
heat pump source temperatures that are

329
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,519
moderate. Um, but at the end of the day,

330
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,440
what matters? Well, what matters is

331
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
we're trying to save on energy, right?

332
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,720
That's why we install these systems. But

333
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,880
if it's going to cost you an arm and a

334
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
leg to do that, it's probably not going

335
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
to make a whole lot of sense. So, to

336
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,639
balance the energy cost with the

337
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,040
construction cost is the most important

338
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,440
thing to make sure that it's practical,

339
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,360
right? Because if if it's too expensive,

340
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
nobody's going to buy it um at the end

341
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,120
of the day. Um, and there are

342
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,880
intangibles. You know, a lot of people

343
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,360
value carbon in different ways. In

344
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,560
Canada, we have a carbon tax. Um, so

345
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,639
that's that's quantified. Um, but the

346
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,240
main thing to consider when you're when

347
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,079
you're looking at a geothermal system,

348
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
in my opinion, is to balance these two

349
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,600
things, construction cost, and then the

350
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
energy savings that you're getting from

351
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,279
that investment because you're buying an

352
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,279
asset, which is that that ground heat

353
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,040
exchanger.

354
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,040
So, before I pass it to my colleague

355
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,399
Nick, I thought I'd throw in a little

356
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,600
segue slide here. I believe one person

357
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,800
had a similar slide yesterday where it

358
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,519
looks at the temperature in the

359
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,240
distribution piping of district systems

360
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,600
and over time we used to use really high

361
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,480
temperature right I mean we still do

362
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,880
today pressurized steam but that leads

363
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,120
to low efficiency and so over time we've

364
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,600
been able to reduce our temperature in

365
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,360
our distribution piping which has led to

366
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
an increase in efficiency so now we're

367
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
dealing with ambient temperatures which

368
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
has increased our efficiency in these

369
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,560
district energy systems quite

370
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,000
dramatically. So, thank you folks for

371
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,000
listening and I'll now pass it to Nick.
