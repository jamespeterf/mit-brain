00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob Stoner and

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,560
this is what if it works coming to you

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,480
from the MIT energy initiative and

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,450
looking at the energy solutions to

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,719
climate

7
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:17,240
[Music]

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,800
change and today we're joined by a

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,279
researcher and entrepreneur who's not

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,760
afraid to swim against the tide there's

11
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,000
a lot of Fantasy around climate change

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,920
and the sense that if we can just really

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,719
focus on developing Renewables that will

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,079
solve all of our problems desroy PL

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,079
argues yes absolutely develop Renewables

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,239
but that's not where the conversation

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,800
should end we need to have a plan that

18
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,199
kind of gets us to that renewable future

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,000
and does it in a way that minimizes

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,559
emissions from our current practices we

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
can't escape our current practices so I

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,000
come from the great state of Maine and

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,600
there's a phrase there you can't get

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,160
there from here when you ask someone

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,719
directions you can't get to that

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,280
renewable future from the state that

27
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,399
we're at right now without going through

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,080
a

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,840
transition a transition that as we'll

30
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,960
discuss may involve making carbon

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,240
dioxide today a conversation with desire

32
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,880
Plata associate professor of civil and

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,040
environmental engineering at MIT and the

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,759
co-director of the MIT climate and

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,840
sustainability

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,439
Consortium Des re welcome good to see

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,680
you I'm good to see you too nice to see

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,079
you Des so I'm just going to start with

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,840
kind of a big provocative statement that

40
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,680
you made not long ago this is a quote we

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,119
can sit here today and entertain the

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,159
fantasy that coal-based energy is going

43
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,119
away but I can tell you that is not the

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,520
reality so I heard you say that in a

45
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,680
talk and um I think a lot of people

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,719
would think like wait what aren't we

47
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,479
phasing out coal aren't we sort of

48
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,119
almost done with that what's what is the

49
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,479
reality what's the fantasy yeah for sure

50
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,079
I mean the reality is that coal is not

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,240
going away at the rate that people

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,039
imagine and really one of the big

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,360
drivers for that is the fact that China

54
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,360
and India are experiencing enormous

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,120
economic growth and that growth is

56
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,440
underpinned by the extraction of coal in

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,160
those Nations we have a perception here

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,160
in the United States that coal is going

59
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,519
away because of the natural gas boom

60
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,319
actually which displaced a lot of coal

61
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,000
use but even here in the US Cole is even

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,879
undergoing a boom actually since the

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,879
Russia Ukraine conflict um the prices of

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,400
coal have gone up the Reliance on coal

65
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,920
is is here um and and that's necessary

66
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,280
to to meet our energy needs so while

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,720
we'd like to be going in the other

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,920
direction we're actually not so then

69
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,800
when you look at that landscape people

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,000
assume Cole is sort of on its way out

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,760
but you're saying really not as far as

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,440
you can tell not the story The Numbers

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,440
tell right yeah that's not the story The

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,080
Numbers tell now um I'll say that lots

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,159
of listeners are going to go Google this

76
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,400
right now and you can find charts that

77
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,480
will forecast past The Disappearance of

78
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,760
coal through time and you and you can

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,159
look at coal for energy production

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,159
decreasing and it looks like it's

81
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,400
decreasing all over the world that's

82
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:16,080
just not the reality in a couple of very

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,599
large um Holdings and again China India

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,959
Indonesia all extracting coal at at

85
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,319
fairly High rates because it's necessary

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,720
for their economy it's also um talked

87
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:29,480
about as uh socially just right so why

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,360
should we tell other nations that they

89
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,920
cannot use their domestic energy why

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,519
should we tell them that they can't

91
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,599
experience economic growth and so

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,360
there's a bit of a social element tied

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,439
into it uh that it's not just about

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,360
access to to energy but access to

95
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,840
domestic energy and enabling their

96
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,920
populations to experience the same

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,560
Prosperity that we've benefited from in

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,920
the United States and in the European

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Union so as somebody who wants to

100
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,079
mitigate climate change when you see

101
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,439
that that story with coal and you see

102
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,480
the numbers and you understand the

103
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,920
trajectory what does that say to you

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,599
about what you should be doing we all

105
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,560
should be doing we all should be doing I

106
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,280
mean what it says to me is that we're

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,199
going to have to be pursuing carbon

108
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,519
removal strategies carbon emissions

109
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,440
reduction strategies both for carbon

110
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,000
dioxide that's released during energy

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,560
generation at large Point sources like

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,080
power plants but also geologic sources

113
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,320
of of methane that are emitted anytime

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,919
you open up a coal mine so thinking

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,840
about those emissions terms in a very

116
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,880
serious way and trying to develop novel

117
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,199
strategies there I also just want to say

118
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,759
for a minute to give credit where it's

119
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,120
due that you know China and India have

120
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,360
installed enormous amounts of Renewable

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Power as well and and they should be

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,039
celebrated for that so it's just that

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,320
the pace of growth in these very large

124
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,360
populations is enormous and requires the

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,960
utilization of that coal as well as the

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,479
renewable energy sources so while Global

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,199
growth in Renewables is faster than the

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,280
global growth in fossil our hunger for

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,080
that energy outpaces our ability to

130
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,680
install Renewables and and that's what

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,560
keeps us pinned to Coal or one of the

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,039
things China also has different problems

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,440
from countries in in the sense of a

134
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,039
having not very many other resources to

135
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,840
rely on they don't have natural gas but

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,400
they've also got this this very

137
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,080
industrialized economy and a

138
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,039
concentration of people in big cities in

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,880
terrible pollution problems I mean a lot

140
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,680
of the really bad pollution days we see

141
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,919
in the world are either in Northern

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,800
India or in China the Chinese have

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,199
transitioned rapidly toward electric

144
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,960
vehicles over the last couple of years

145
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
and they're still racing ahead yes and

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,120
you hear about like byd and these

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,680
vehicles that we don't have in America

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
because of tariffs but like that are

149
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,960
competing in many places with the Teslas

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,120
of the world so it does seem like

151
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,800
they're the leader in solar well they're

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,880
coal powered

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,919
cars but it sounds sounds like there's

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,120
all of the above like yeah there's coal

155
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,440
but yeah they are it doesn't negate the

156
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
fact that they are doing a lot with

157
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,319
solar they are doing a lot with electric

158
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,440
cars yes that's right yeah and so I just

159
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,680
want to acknowledge that it's not um

160
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,960
some ignorance of climate change that is

161
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,199
that is driving these decisions it's

162
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,120
really that that drive towards more

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,120
prosperity for all of their citizens and

164
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,280
domestic availability of coal resources

165
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,680
um and in in India in particular coal

166
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,599
really underpins many facets of the

167
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,039
economy so the coal that's moved on the

168
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,120
trains those are subsidizes the movement

169
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,840
of the people who move by train in order

170
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,560
to get to work and so it's all kind of

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,520
really embedded in in how the the base

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,120
of the economy is structured um Rob I

173
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,599
know you spent a lot of time in India I

174
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,240
I feel like people sometimes in the US

175
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,120
will think well can't people in

176
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,039
countries that are developing now skip

177
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,000
some technologies like skip the kind of

178
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,319
dirty technologies that we went through

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,960
and get right to the clean ones in in in

180
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,800
some measure yes but one of the

181
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,080
challenges with transitioning away from

182
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,520
coal is that you're transitioning from a

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,280
very very energy dense medium to if if

184
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,440
if Renewables in the form of solar and

185
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,919
wind one that isn't very energy dense

186
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,360
one that takes up a lot of real estate

187
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,560
both in India and in China I think

188
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,199
there's there's a certain amount of

189
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,599
growing public push back toward building

190
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,000
these very very large solar arrays and

191
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,479
windmills and places where people can

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,639
see them along with the transmission

193
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,039
lines that bring that power to Market so

194
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,039
they're making great strides in other

195
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,280
areas as well particularly the Chinese

196
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,800
uh with the development of nuclear

197
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,080
technologies and they just announced

198
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,919
very recently that they they've built

199
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,199
and operated the world's first so-called

200
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:50,080
Pebble bed reactor which lends itself to

201
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,720
um very efficient uh use of of uranium

202
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,759
and uh very high temperature nuclear

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,599
reactors they're building a lot of

204
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,520
advanced reactors as well far more than

205
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,159
we are so that they're trying these

206
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,159
other directions that

207
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,680
work for them with their large

208
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,919
populations and and lack of land and and

209
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,520
more contention for land than we have

210
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,759
but it's it's a really hard battle

211
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,560
they're not cheaper uh and and they take

212
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,440
a lot of capital so you talked about how

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
when I think when we mine for coal a

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,840
whole bunch of methane comes out of the

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,520
ground so explain that and uh people I

216
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,199
think you know heard of methan but like

217
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,360
how does it compare to carbon dioxide as

218
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,719
problematic in terms of uh global

219
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,959
warming great question I'll I'll give

220
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,599
you a long answer okay to it um I

221
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,039
there's a a wonderful scientist um here

222
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,800
at MIT whose name is Penny Chisum and

223
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,560
Penny wrote a great series of books

224
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,560
called the sunlight series and she's got

225
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,320
one of these books in particular that's

226
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
a children's book actually and it's

227
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,839
called buried sunlight and I think it's

228
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,080
important for people to recognize that

229
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,120
all of our fossil fuels are uh buried

230
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,880
sunlight energy right there was a a

231
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,240
microscopic plant at some some point in

232
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,800
history floating on the surface ocean

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,079
that died and was buried and subducted

234
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,320
under the Continental shelves there it

235
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,440
experienced High pressures and

236
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,880
temperatures and was essentially cooked

237
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,880
into things like oil and coal and

238
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,079
methane so that methane is actually a

239
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,720
what's called a thermogenic byproduct of

240
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:25,399
that cooking process where you get coal

241
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,560
rocks and oil the liquids and gas the

242
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:32,040
the lighter hydrocarbons and so it's

243
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,440
there in in the coal bed formation it's

244
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,160
there when you extract oil it's a

245
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,880
naturally occurring geologic thing and

246
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,120
when you open up a coal mine there is

247
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,480
going to be methane there now and it

248
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,519
just escapes into the air you like open

249
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,839
up the ground you know people think like

250
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,160
strip mining or something you just open

251
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,839
up the ground and it goes up into the

252
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
that's right or even if you dig a hole

253
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,240
into the Earth and some of these mines

254
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,880
can be miles below the Earth's surface

255
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,399
you can functionally think of them as as

256
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,320
networks of cities almost like connected

257
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,760
Subway systems that are that are deep

258
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,920
within the Earth they might be a minutes

259
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,959
ele long elevator ride to get to some of

260
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,000
these coal mines so so right away you're

261
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,800
hearing energy intensity you've got to

262
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,600
get fresh air down there for the miners

263
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,079
to breathe you've got to make sure that

264
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,240
that methane doesn't accumulate to

265
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,440
levels where it's going to be explosive

266
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,360
and present a a big safety risk to the

267
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,959
miners themselves and so in order to

268
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,800
mitigate that risk they pull air out of

269
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,760
the mine to create a negative pressure

270
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,079
that pulls fresh air in in from outside

271
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,040
and that is called ventilation air and

272
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,360
that ventilation air is Laden with

273
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,680
methane now those ventilation air shafts

274
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,600
are moving air at astronomically High

275
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,600
rates so it can be on the order of a

276
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
million cubic feet a minute that's

277
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
something like 10 tractor trailers going

278
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,360
past you in six seconds it's a it's an

279
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,880
enormous volume of air and again that is

280
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,680
that is done in order to make sure the

281
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,519
miners can breathe and to make sure

282
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,120
methane doesn't accumulate to explosive

283
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,720
levels it's a safety measure that

284
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,720
ventilation air methane is responsible

285
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,240
for a large amount of atmospheric

286
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,920
methane emissions and while not all

287
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,200
mines are ventilated some are surface

288
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,839
strip mines so I can't give you a good

289
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,120
breakdown of of which is coming from

290
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,720
that ventilation AA and which is coming

291
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
from the strip bines but we know it

292
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,800
accounts for somewhere around 50 million

293
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
metric tons of methane annually the

294
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,360
atmospheric growth term for methane is

295
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,440
around 20 million metric tons annually

296
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,760
and so if you could get just less than

297
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,440
half of glob coal mines to adopt a

298
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,200
technology that destroyed that methane

299
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,880
you would stop the accumulation of

300
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,959
methane in an instant you know with one

301
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,480
technology and then the atmosphere can

302
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,160
start to clean itself through natural

303
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,959
processes so you're saying we you get

304
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,600
back to the Natural rate of evolution of

305
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,680
methane at that point because you're

306
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,279
removing the anthropogenic source almost

307
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,000
at least for coal mining yes there are

308
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,120
many other anthropogenic sources of

309
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,880
methane methane is really short-lived in

310
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,200
the atmosphere it's halflife is on the

311
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,600
order of about 12 years and so what that

312
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,320
means is if you could at least stop

313
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,519
dumping so much methane into the

314
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,519
atmosphere you'd see a really fast

315
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,000
cleaning process occurring where that

316
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,120
methane is is being destroyed by natural

317
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,959
processes now tell us why we should care

318
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,480
about methane is I mean carbon dioxide

319
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,360
is what we hear about you hear about

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,040
carbon dioxide a lot yeah so in in

321
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,560
carbon dioxide equivalence which is kind

322
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,000
of the term that that you hear about

323
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:25,000
methane is about 120 times as a as a

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,279
warming as CO2 uh

325
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,720
instantaneously um wow yeah so when

326
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,480
don't we talk about methane more

327
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,800
well that's why you're here yeah that's

328
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,560
why I'm here so the reason uh that we

329
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,959
don't talk about methane more is really

330
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,079
because when we think about our Global

331
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,560
Climate models we're thinking over very

332
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,199
long time scales what's going to happen

333
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,720
to us 100 years from now okay and if you

334
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:48,639
think about um 100e time scales

335
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,360
methane's fate in the atmosphere is to

336
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,360
naturally turn into CO2 anyway and so

337
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,279
most of the methane that's emitted today

338
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,959
will become CO2 o over time um about 90%

339
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,959
of it it becomes CO2 over time um and

340
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,880
and relatively short time scales and so

341
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,519
because we're looking on that long time

342
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,399
Horizon we say well it's going to be CO2

343
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,040
anyway and so our conversation hasn't

344
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,440
really emphasized methane so when we

345
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,480
look on that 100-year time scale we say

346
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,920
that our our methane emissions might be

347
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,079
equivalent to about 16% of our total

348
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,040
greenhouse gas emissions when you look

349
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,360
on the 20year time scale our methane

350
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,320
emissions are equivalent in total

351
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,199
warming to CO2 So within the next 10

352
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,079
years methane will warm the atmosphere

353
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,760
as much as CO2 even though methane is

354
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,839
more than 200 times less

355
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,920
concentrated okay so but if methane is

356
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,040
going to become CO2 why is it so M I

357
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,839
mean why don't we just sit around and

358
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,639
wait for that to happen like what would

359
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,720
be your argument for like no no let's

360
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,639
get on this now and why is it so much

361
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,920
more warming than CO2 if it's just going

362
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,120
to become CO2 yeah really really

363
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,920
important question yeah so so I like say

364
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,320
Co CO2 is a low and slow warmer um so we

365
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,079
could drop CO2 emissions to zero today

366
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,240
which is would be great but the

367
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,800
atmosphere wouldn't feel it for 50 to

368
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,680
100 years because it's accumulating um

369
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,480
over time methane does its damage right

370
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,320
away it's a really potent warmer and

371
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,079
then it slowly turns in to CO2 in the

372
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,839
atmosphere if we could accelerate that

373
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,680
process that's going to happen anyway um

374
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,839
and get methane to become CO2 really

375
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,040
quickly it wouldn't get a chance to warm

376
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,120
up the atmosphere the way that it does

377
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
that would allow us to change the rate

378
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,680
of climate forcing that we're going to

379
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,040
experience in the next two decades um

380
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,160
that could potentially save us from

381
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,959
passing so-called climate tipping points

382
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,360
with people might have heard about so as

383
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,440
we warm the planet the rate of release

384
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,240
of natural sources of methane actually

385
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,279
increases um and so if we can pump the

386
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,519
brakes on climate change we could

387
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,759
potentially reduce the amount of natural

388
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,320
methane emissions that are going to

389
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,759
occur in the next several decades now

390
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,440
some estimates say that if we drop

391
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,800
anthropogenic emissions man-made

392
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,279
emissions by 50% by 2030 we could save a

393
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,920
half a degree warming by 2100 it's

394
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,600
actually the only gas that does that

395
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,279
again modulating CO2 today doesn't

396
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,639
change the rate of warming it changes

397
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,399
the absolute amount of warming that

398
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,399
we're going to experience methane's the

399
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,800
only thing the only greenhouse gas that

400
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
will change the rate of warming in our

401
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,040
lifetimes I think it's important to also

402
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,600
get your head around the fact that it's

403
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,759
not equivalent to the same amount of CO2

404
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,680
I mean it so you'd only have to remove

405
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,519
or reduce CO2 emissions direct CO2

406
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,839
emissions by a relatively small amount

407
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,440
to compensate for the additional CO2

408
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,600
that's entering the atmosphere from the

409
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,399
degradation of the of the methane yeah

410
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,920
you you got it so methane emissions are

411
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,519
measured in millions of metric tons CO2

412
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,240
emissions are measured in billions of

413
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,759
metric tons and so you can convert a lot

414
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,279
of methane into CO2 and it it doesn't

415
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,160
end up being a big input term it's it's

416
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,639
like a minuscule contribution to glob

417
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,120
CO2 emissions and again that's what was

418
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,920
going to happen to it anyway um it

419
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,880
methane was going to become CO2 all

420
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,000
we're doing is trying to accelerate that

421
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,240
process so that methane doesn't get a

422
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,040
chance to to warm the atmosphere but it

423
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,120
turning it into CO2 I think it's

424
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,120
underline helps to mitigate global

425
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,800
warming that's right yeah not what You'

426
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,399
think right not what You' think right

427
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,399
because you hear about CO2 being so bad

428
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,319
and just to to put some numbers on it

429
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,000
you could take half of the atmosphere's

430
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,680
methane and convert it to CO2 and the

431
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,519
CO2 concentration in the atmosphere

432
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,240
would go from around 423 parts per

433
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,000
million to

434
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,399
424 parts per million right it's a

435
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,720
little blip in the CO2 contribution but

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,000
it saves you 16% of climate forcing over

437
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,600
the next hundred years it's a huge big

438
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,440
deal so I think we should talk about how

439
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,959
you would do this but Rob I wonder I

440
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,639
mean you've seen so many people

441
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,880
developing so many Technologies around

442
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:04,760
climate change is desire unusual in talk

443
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,760
A talking about methane and B I'm

444
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,280
creating carbon

445
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,160
dioxide well she is but in a good way

446
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,400
Ian does she stand out this is a very

447
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,919
pragmatic perspective I mean there's no

448
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,000
question about it and and it's it's a

449
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,600
very healthy one and I have to say it's

450
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,760
not an unusual perspective at MIT but

451
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,480
this is this is looking coldly at the

452
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,360
numbers and saying we could do this and

453
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,840
have this very large impact relatively

454
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
quickly and we should do that but we

455
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,039
also have to get on the CO2 and I think

456
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,640
people appreciate that as well and I

457
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:37,080
don't think you're in any sense arguing

458
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,520
that we don't that's right and I think

459
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,760
people get really confused about that

460
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,280
they say why coal why CO2 and I'm uh I I

461
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,280
would love to see Renewables expanded as

462
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,080
quickly as possible I would love to see

463
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,960
us get away from fossil energy sources

464
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,400
when and where we can um and I and we

465
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,840
definitely need to get control of our

466
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,039
CO2 emissions that's absolutely

467
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,240
important but the reality is that we're

468
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,080
going to have these emissions and if if

469
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,480
I can do something to stop that

470
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,320
accumulation I'm not too proud to to

471
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,799
engage in that activity yeah so you're

472
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,640
not just telling an interesting story

473
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,200
though I mean you are a an environmental

474
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,039
engineer you're doing stuff you're

475
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,840
researching it but you're also getting

476
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:20,480
involved as an entrepreneur right tell

477
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,440
us about that yeah sure um so on the

478
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,400
methane front we've we're standing up a

479
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,600
company that's called MOX a so we're

480
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,799
trying to oxidize methane in the

481
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,159
atmosphere um or at very low

482
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,640
concentrations and uh we're just

483
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,440
founding this company and it's really

484
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,440
the product of um you know several years

485
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,760
of research uh that we've been doing at

486
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,480
MIT and we'd like to get this into the

487
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,480
hands of of coal miners um and others

488
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,320
who have low-level methane emissions uh

489
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,720
all over the globe as really as fast as

490
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,640
we can and this this 2030 Target is

491
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,840
aggressive and on purpose because we

492
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,080
really need to stand up these

493
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,320
Technologies in order to see that that

494
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,280
uh that warming benefit to the rate of

495
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,280
climate change so we could get the

496
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,480
Indians and Chinese to use this

497
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,320
technology far less expensively than to

498
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,080
pay them to switch away from coal for

499
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,400
example I mean that's again I'm we're

500
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,679
all going to get into trouble for this

501
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
we're all going to get into trouble for

502
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,520
this yeah no that's right I mean it

503
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,400
would be it would be really lovely if we

504
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,400
could get the technology adopted in in

505
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
China and India there are a lot of

506
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,240
hurdles to that I will say that you know

507
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,080
there's really great people working in

508
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,720
the governments on both sides who are

509
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,039
who are trying to to make this happen

510
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,919
and to make it happen in a way that's

511
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:37,480
economically incentivized um if not

512
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,039
politically mandated and um there are

513
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,320
lots of barriers um and and so we

514
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,640
continue to try to be part of that

515
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,200
conversation I'm very tired most of the

516
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,400
time I take every phone call I hope I

517
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,240
don't get a lot of phone calls because

518
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,720
of that but but yeah I mean if somebody

519
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,760
calls and says how can we think through

520
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,000
how to remove barriers here we we try to

521
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,280
engage um on all fronts and having a

522
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,640
commercial entity is part of being able

523
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,640
to do that successfully

524
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,079
[Music]

525
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,240
so explain the technology so let's say I

526
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,880
run a coal mine and I say okay this

527
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,840
sounds interesting and what is it that

528
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm buying or getting and what does it

529
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,640
look like and how does it work so I

530
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,559
think there's kind of two categories of

531
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,679
coal miners I ones that live in

532
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,960
regulated environments that have really

533
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,760
good pricing on on carbon dioxide

534
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,799
emissions reductions and then ones that

535
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,320
do not live in regulated environments

536
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,960
and have kind of the wild west of carbon

537
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,880
dioxide emissions credits where are the

538
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,679
regulated places places like Australia

539
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,760
and in the European Union there are some

540
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,880
pretty good Financial incentives to be

541
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,960
adopting methane emissions reductions at

542
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,080
your coal mine and in those cases the

543
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,640
miners themselves May reach out and say

544
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,919
look I need this to be compliant there's

545
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,520
going to be a tax on the amount of

546
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,679
methane emissions that that that I um

547
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,600
emit to the atmosphere so I have a

548
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,320
quantifiable number uh that I can spend

549
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,600
on your technology to stop that emission

550
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,080
from happening so so it puts a it puts a

551
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,120
ceiling on what they're going to be

552
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,440
willing to spend for for a technology

553
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,520
for an abatement technology they're also

554
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,760
allowed to sell that abated methane um

555
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,559
into Glo Global carbon markets and so

556
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,799
it's kind of a win-win the technology

557
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,400
can pay for itself on the order of you

558
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:32,919
know 3 to five years in in those cases

559
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,880
um in Europe where they're paying very

560
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,440
really very high dollar amounts for um

561
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,520
carbon dioxide credits the technology

562
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,640
could pay for itself even faster and

563
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,559
that's remarkable in the United States

564
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,559
we don't have we don't have the benefit

565
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,279
of a really well- constrained uh market

566
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,279
for voluntary carbon dioxide market and

567
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,279
what that means is that there's no

568
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,960
reason a coal miner would want to buy

569
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:00,200
this technology um why would you right

570
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,559
it's G to you've got to disrupt your

571
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,720
infrastructure um it costs many millions

572
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,320
of dollars to install the thing these

573
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,400
are Big we're talking about modulating

574
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,840
the the warming rates of the atmosphere

575
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,640
it is big stuff and people need to

576
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,880
recognize that it is going to cost a lot

577
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
of money to build the thing to start

578
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,440
with this is a big filter that goes on

579
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,080
the end of the the fan unit that I

580
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,480
described earlier that's ventilating the

581
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,000
the mine um and then we warm that unit

582
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,520
up and it starts destroying methane and

583
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,960
that's great but there's a risk to the

584
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,520
the coal miner saying they want it

585
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,760
because now they've got this big piece

586
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,480
of infrastructure there so in those

587
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,440
unregulated spaces they're actually

588
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,400
third-party developers who will come and

589
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,200
say hey coal miner I'll cut you a deal

590
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,240
I'll pay for all this infrastructure and

591
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,039
I'm going to give you a few bucks um you

592
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,600
know on the sale of the of the carbon

593
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,400
and and I'll keep the rest to pay for

594
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,120
the unit and so they're we're having to

595
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,679
be creative about how we deploy these um

596
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,880
and and really rely on on minor saying

597
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,200
okay I'll take the risk it's one of

598
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,679
those things feel like also where

599
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,039
expensive is a relative term right like

600
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,679
it may cost millions of dollars to it

601
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,760
sounds like to install right but on the

602
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,960
other hand it costs billions or

603
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,919
trillions of dollars to clean up after

604
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,640
storms that like ruin everybody's house

605
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,279
and so you could argue it's kind of

606
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,760
cheap if you can mitigate some climate

607
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,640
change and therefore have to say you

608
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,760
know be able to save billions of dollars

609
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,039
through like FEMA you know and the

610
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,640
things you would have to do to help

611
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,559
people so I'm really glad you raised the

612
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,039
point about extreme weather events I

613
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,480
think the number of billion dollar

614
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,320
storms um has been steadily increasing

615
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,200
over the past 20 years I think it's up

616
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,720
over 20 annually now in the United

617
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,200
States so the American taxpayer is

618
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,720
already paying for for climate change

619
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,760
and I would love to see us pay for

620
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,360
mitigation efforts uh I don't want to

621
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,840
communicate false hope here we are

622
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,520
committed to a certain amount of climate

623
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,559
change because of historic CO2 emissions

624
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,159
and and really contemporary methane

625
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,240
emissions from the past 20 years or so

626
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:09,240
um that that amount of forcing will

627
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,600
happen but if we could spend just a

628
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,720
fraction of those monies on uh climate

629
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,760
mitigation efforts I think they would go

630
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,520
a really long way uh we have to

631
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,240
incentivize the adoption of these

632
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,440
emissions reduction Technologies and

633
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,279
right now we're really not doing that

634
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,360
very well so there's as you know a lot

635
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,880
of

636
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,600
money

637
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,840
companies Venture Capital firms wealthy

638
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,640
families out there trying thinking about

639
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:41,159
this issue caring about it is it hard

640
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,120
for you to make your case because either

641
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,880
a this isn't like something people you

642
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,399
know people know what a solar panel is

643
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,720
or and people know what an electric car

644
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:49,279
is and you're saying well this is this

645
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,360
other thing and you probably never heard

646
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,159
of it slash is it hard to be like here's

647
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,159
what I'd like some money for to save the

648
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,480
planet making carbon dioxide and people

649
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,840
are like ah okay well I mean do you ever

650
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,159
get that I I do get that a lot I think

651
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,880
people can get their head around the

652
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,880
carbon dioxide thing because if you look

653
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,840
at the numbers there's not it's not a

654
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,279
lot of carbon dioxide that's what it was

655
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,720
going to become anyway you know a

656
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,640
molecule of of methane released always

657
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,880
does more damage than a molecule of CO2

658
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,799
because it becomes a molecule of CO2 so

659
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,120
if I can make that process faster and

660
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,520
cut methane's ability to warm the

661
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,000
atmosphere people are really on board

662
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,159
with that what people don't like

663
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,080
investing in is coal anything right they

664
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,520
don't want to touch coal with a 20ft

665
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,320
pole but the reality it is that coal is

666
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,679
here natural gas is here it is not going

667
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,120
away and we actually need it to get us

668
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,399
to those renewable energy systems and

669
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,760
all of the infrastructure that we're

670
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:43,200
imagining for the future um and so if

671
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,399
we're in that catch 22 we had better

672
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,760
damn be sure that we are minimizing the

673
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:49,640
emissions associated with those fossil

674
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,480
energy sources and that's what I think

675
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,720
people really really struggle with we

676
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,799
want to be in that future but we can't

677
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,760
quite Lea frog to that future let yet

678
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,679
there's a transition and somebody's got

679
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,200
to support that transition in a real and

680
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,679
meaningful way or else it's going to get

681
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,600
a lot worse and we got to get on this

682
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:07,399
methane thing right

683
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,760
away so this is an appeal to all our

684
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:13,200
listeners to uh there's a linkow invest

685
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,799
in desise company so this is not easy to

686
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,200
raise Venture Capital funding for yeah

687
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,919
it's really not very easy and I and I

688
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,720
you know I give a lot of credit to to my

689
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,640
partners at moxir who've been working

690
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,600
very hard to to raise capital for this

691
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,520
and to um you know the earnest uh folks

692
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,000
who are willing to go into coal mines um

693
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,840
and say look this is how we can help

694
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,600
reduce the the carbon footprint of this

695
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,480
process today and that's a really

696
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,600
important part uh I think rob you

697
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,279
mentioned you know we at MIT have

698
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,080
classically tried to work with people to

699
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,440
make more sustainable Technologies and

700
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,200
work with the technologies that are here

701
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,799
today including the fossil energy

702
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,360
industry and so that's what we've really

703
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,000
been trying to do like help us

704
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,679
understand your problems help us come up

705
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,480
with Creative Solutions during this

706
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,279
transition period um to to the future we

707
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,720
we want to that all of us want to see

708
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,880
really what about the other part of the

709
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,840
fossil industry the the the Natural Gas

710
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,000
part of the fossil industry basically

711
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,840
the methane part of the natural the

712
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
fossil industry yeah that's right I mean

713
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,919
so I natural gas of course it's its

714
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
primary component is methane there are a

715
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:16,840
lot of uh what are called fugitive

716
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,559
emissions across the the entire natural

717
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,880
gas production system from from the time

718
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,600
that you you drop that well to the

719
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,440
processing and refining of that methan

720
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,600
to the distribution into our homes there

721
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,200
are leaks all along the way including

722
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,200
that your natural gas stove that you

723
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,279
might have in your home and so how do we

724
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,960
deal with that those actually you know

725
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,760
people know about flares or you can

726
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,640
light a match and uh convert methane to

727
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,919
CO2 that's pretty easy that only works a

728
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,720
downside yeah that's kind of the

729
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,720
downside right it can be a downside but

730
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,640
that uh that only works at really high

731
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,399
concentrations of methane and it most of

732
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,559
me the world's methane emissions at

733
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:55,279
least 80% and probably closer to 90% are

734
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,279
in this dilute and diffuse concentration

735
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,679
range and so the technology that we've

736
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,559
tried to develop is actually doing that

737
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,360
same combustion chemistry methane to CO2

738
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,320
but it's doing it catalytically inside

739
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,799
of of of this porous uh clay that we've

740
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,640
developed so we've talked about a couple

741
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:17,120
things that you open up the ground for

742
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,679
right um natural gas and Mining

743
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,720
coal another thing that you open up the

744
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,760
ground for is to get metals and we need

745
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,159
those increasingly for these cleaner

746
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,360
technologies that are part of a

747
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:32,120
transition MH but does Methane also come

748
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,279
out of the ground when you are like well

749
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,640
we need we need a bunch of metals yeah

750
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,720
yeah there are certain there are certain

751
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,720
Minds um in the world in certain

752
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,080
minerals that that do have enriched

753
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,320
methane not all of them but certainly

754
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,640
some of them and so it's a concern there

755
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,640
I think that you know you bring up a

756
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,399
really good point uh in order to meet

757
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,000
our our modest 2040 sustainable

758
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,799
development energy goals I think we need

759
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,159
um something like four times the metals

760
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,399
that we've ever extracted on on planet

761
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,279
Earth and in order to get those Metals

762
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:04,640
we dig really big holes in the ground

763
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,679
they can be 5,000 m across and 500 M

764
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,880
deep um and you can't get to the bottom

765
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,440
of those mines and back out with a

766
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,279
battery there's no battery in the world

767
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,640
that does that for you and that very

768
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,760
specific problem beholds you to to

769
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,480
diesel fuel um and to fossil-based

770
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,880
carbon sources at least right now you

771
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,919
know and so there's a lot of innovation

772
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,480
that needs to happen in mining so that

773
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,120
we can get those minerals to the surface

774
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,480
of the Earth enable that renewable

775
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,159
energy transition but do it in a way

776
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,159
that doesn't come with the the really

777
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,679
burdensome carbon footprint Associated

778
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,480
both with extraction as well as

779
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,440
processing and refining those

780
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,720
materials I wonder rob you know when I

781
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,679
hear what's involved in mining metals

782
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,559
that we use for let's say electric cars

783
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,799
I don't know I wonder if you feel like

784
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:54,440
that's like that's a blind spot that

785
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:56,440
people tend to have where they think

786
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,320
well I've bought an electric car and now

787
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,360
I'm good because like you you know I'm

788
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,440
sort of absolved what whatever my

789
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,600
neighbor with this gas guzzling SUV you

790
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,880
know is doing I I am doing none of that

791
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,679
but complicated really yeah well when

792
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,200
you get that battery in your electric

793
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,519
car somebody's mining nickel probably

794
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,840
from a soil deposit a laterite deposit

795
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,039
in probably Indonesia or some part of

796
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,200
Southeast Asia and the forest is falling

797
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,600
and tailings are running into the ocean

798
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,600
and I sent a student to look around and

799
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,039
engine Asia uh where we have a lot of

800
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,720
relationships and we're working hard

801
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,360
together just to see the scale of

802
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,120
environmental damage and and it's

803
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,679
horrendous and that's just from the

804
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,960
extraction of Earth and and and exposing

805
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,880
exposing the material they want to

806
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,080
digging but then they go into these

807
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,840
horrific Toil and Trouble kind of

808
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,440
processes that desire was talking about

809
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,600
and there are different Pathways that

810
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,000
that they can follow but but right this

811
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,279
is getting electric cars here has all

812
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,200
kinds of consequences it has

813
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:00,559
consequences for mining it has consequen

814
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,600
es for electricity generation we do a

815
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,000
lot more of it we use a lot more fossil

816
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,799
fuels in the course of using of doing

817
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,200
that so you

818
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,880
know clearly it's beneficial uh to move

819
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,639
in the direction of electrification and

820
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,519
we need to do it rapidly but we really

821
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:18,600
do have to pay attention to that Metals

822
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:20,440
production end I like some of the stuff

823
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,039
you've been talking about with recycling

824
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,240
of batteries as we get more and more

825
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,760
these batteries out there we have the

826
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,600
possibility of reusing that material you

827
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,679
got it yeah yeah so um I think this is

828
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
you know really great example and I

829
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,080
would just underscore what you said like

830
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,480
people you know listening you definitely

831
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,559
should be you know moving towards

832
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,000
electrification as kind of as fast as we

833
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,200
can um and we're we're taking care of

834
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,840
the the metals problem so I'll say you

835
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,840
know I I have another a prior startup

836
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,880
company that um spun out of my lab uses

837
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,279
um a technique called Electro extraction

838
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,120
so we don't use the really high

839
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,519
temperatures we don't use the acids and

840
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,200
bases um we use just a fundamentally

841
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,720
different process um enabled by

842
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,519
nanomaterial I'm largely developed you

843
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,639
know during my PhD and afterwards I was

844
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:08,080
here at MIT um and you I think my second

845
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:11,480
PhD students a CEO of a company called

846
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,000
enth cycle um and en cycle um just

847
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,039
started the first domestic production of

848
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,360
nickel and Cobalt from recovered uh

849
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,440
spent battery materials uh here in the

850
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,200
US so um I got a a great message from

851
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,440
her the other day that said you know we

852
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,600
just produced our first product and it's

853
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,240
working even better than we expected and

854
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,120
you know it just almost brings tears to

855
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,519
your eyes because it's so amazing and it

856
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,519
happens with 92% reduction in the

857
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,600
greenhouse gas emissions because you're

858
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,519
using stuff that's already out there

859
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,080
don't need to go back into the Earth

860
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,919
because we all have all bunch of stuff

861
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,080
in our is this is coming from like old

862
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,440
phones old computers old whatever

863
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,039
largely old batteries today because you

864
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,440
know those that first generation of

865
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,120
hybrid electric vehicles and um and and

866
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,039
full electric vehicles are starting to

867
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,679
come offline and and we can take those

868
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,919
spent batteries and reuse them there are

869
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:02,120
also lots of different um Metals you

870
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,320
know we we the the technology really is

871
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,080
is very highly adaptable to lots of

872
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,279
different uh you know Metals in the

873
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,960
periodic table so you say send us your

874
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,919
you know send us your large volume

875
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,799
E-Waste and and we'll come up with a way

876
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,279
to process it and it's really fun you

877
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,039
can go to um our development plant here

878
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,000
in Burlington Mass and look through you

879
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,559
know just piles of of old materials uh

880
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,960
data centers are another big one you

881
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,120
know so where you have concentrated

882
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,240
stocks of lots of metals that's great

883
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,120
cuz the economics starts to work um and

884
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,399
it's not just uh that we are are not

885
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,799
digging the hole so to speak um we're

886
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:37,240
also not relying on those acids and

887
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:39,519
bases and those high temperature

888
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,240
processes it's really um very different

889
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,399
and it can be driven with Renewable

890
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,559
Power so it's it starts to decouple us

891
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,799
um and our mining Supply from carbon

892
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,399
emissions like we were talking about

893
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,880
earlier you don't need the diesel truck

894
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:52,840
anymore because you can use what you

895
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,639
have already at the surface of the Earth

896
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,679
the economy is growing so we still got

897
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:58,399
to get more uh so I don't want to imply

898
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:59,880
that it solves all your problem problems

899
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,840
but it's a really important part of the

900
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,240
problem and the technology is adaptable

901
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,000
that it might even be able to go into

902
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,679
those tailing ponds and and other spaces

903
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,760
in mining yeah so we're not going to

904
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,639
recycle our way out of the problem in

905
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,679
the short term until we get so many cars

906
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,760
out there that we're sort of in

907
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,359
equilibrium we're bringing in as many

908
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,599
batteries and recycling them as we're

909
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,679
putting back into cars you got it so

910
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,359
it's decades

911
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,280
away but it's it's still helping now I

912
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,040
mean it's it's it means that some amount

913
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,919
of environmental destruction doesn't

914
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,839
take place because we're separating that

915
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:32,639
yeah that's right and and if you're a

916
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:35,079
you know a synthetic chemist or material

917
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,879
scientist and I gave you a pile of used

918
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:41,040
Goods to use you would look at me like I

919
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,879
was insane so you'd say I want the

920
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,639
99.9999% Purity and what we're you know

921
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:47,359
engaged in some research that's showing

922
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,079
that you actually can get away with a

923
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,040
little bit less you can use recovered

924
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,399
materials um we we can produce a very

925
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,599
high Purity product I should be very

926
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,159
clear about that but because of that you

927
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,200
can actually reuse it and there's very

928
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,000
little the product performed and

929
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,280
performance is absolutely key you know

930
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,800
we're pursuing uh not just envir more

931
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,040
environmentally sustainable Technologies

932
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,119
but ones that that work uh Best in Class

933
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,359
and so that's um I think an exciting

934
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,079
outcrop and really a very new area of

935
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,720
research that needs to be further

936
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,640
explored do you you know we've talked

937
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,040
about a lot of complexities to uh

938
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
climate change that people don't

939
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,280
necessarily think about do you worry

940
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,599
about our ability to address climate

941
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,800
change or transitioning energy sources

942
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,119
if we can't talk about those

943
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,240
complexities I I just wonder what you

944
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:38,520
see and how you feel about that oh yeah

945
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,280
I mean there's a lot of Fantasy around

946
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,440
climate change and the sense that if we

947
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,240
can just really focus on developing

948
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,040
Renewables that will solve all of our

949
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,760
problems we absolutely should be

950
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,000
developing Renewables and it will it is

951
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,920
where we need to be going um but it

952
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,200
doesn't solve our near-term problems and

953
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,119
ignoring the transition will make it

954
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,280
worse we need to pay attention to the

955
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,680
reality of the situation we need to have

956
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,200
a plan that kind of gets us to that

957
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,119
renewable future and does it in a way

958
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,920
that minimizes emissions from our

959
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,160
current practices we can't escape our

960
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,520
current practices so I come from the

961
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,119
great state of Main and there's a phrase

962
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,040
there you can't get there from here when

963
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,880
you ask someone directions you can't get

964
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,240
to that renewable future from the state

965
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,880
that we're at right now without going

966
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,000
through a transition there's risk

967
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,880
associated with that there are

968
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,800
strategies we can deploy and we should

969
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,599
be deploying them and failure to talk

970
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,400
about them is only going to handicap Us

971
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,400
in pursuit of those goals how does that

972
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,200
affect your level of optimism about

973
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:42,480
what's ahead yeah I mean uh I am ever

974
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,119
The Optimist and uh I guess to give a

975
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,440
specific example when I was starting

976
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,480
grad school in this place 21 years ago I

977
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,599
had to explain to people why they should

978
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,160
care about the environment and why it

979
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,520
was it should be embedded in in their

980
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,680
Innovation practices um I don't have to

981
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,079
do that anymore but definitely was not

982
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,440
the Instinct at MIT 21 years ago oh for

983
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,839
sure why would you do that you foolish

984
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,520
person and um and now people come to me

985
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,000
and say we would really like to pursue

986
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,640
this and how can we do it systematically

987
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
quickly um cost effectively and

988
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,440
potentially even at a cost benefit and I

989
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,960
think that that's the transition that

990
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,200
we're part of right now that I'm really

991
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,680
excited to see is that um you know

992
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,800
caring about the environment actually

993
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,880
shouldn't shouldn't be a filter or a

994
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,440
patch or an economic cost it should be

995
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,319
an an opport opportunity and if we um if

996
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,040
we can kind of adapt our practices and

997
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,720
value uh you know the environment and

998
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,520
and yes take a little bit of time but

999
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,800
leverage all the Innovation that's going

1000
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,760
on I think that we can get there the

1001
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,520
methane mitigation strategy you're

1002
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,040
talking about you know say if we just

1003
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,200
think about the mine example is is

1004
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,079
looking at a concentrated Source but not

1005
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,119
a Pure Source of methane it's mixed with

1006
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,560
air and other gases that are coming out

1007
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,760
of the mine and so the strategy of

1008
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,480
breaking down those methane molecules

1009
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,040
that are in that stream is a good one

1010
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,319
because you can't really burn it yeah

1011
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,359
but if you can burn it isn't the smarter

1012
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:09,119
thing to do to to aggregate all a lot of

1013
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,920
small leaks and burn them make

1014
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,960
electricity and release it as CO2 into

1015
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,760
the atmosphere do you think about a lot

1016
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,200
of people love that idea and that goes

1017
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,440
into the calculation where people say

1018
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,160
you could actually make money by

1019
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,160
stopping these diffuse uh leaks a lot of

1020
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,520
these diffuse leaks happen in really

1021
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,520
remote regions where there's no

1022
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,839
infrastructure to do that concentrating

1023
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,359
and by the time you built it the leak

1024
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,520
would be gone right like these are

1025
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,640
transient in time they're transient in

1026
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,079
space they're in remote areas so that's

1027
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,480
another kind of bit of of fantasy that I

1028
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,400
think is is a little bit dangerous um we

1029
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,280
need to have alternative strategies to

1030
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,119
finding and and abating those leaks and

1031
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,200
and destruction can be a very important

1032
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,640
one we are um you know just taking these

1033
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,800
methane molecules and breaking them

1034
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,680
apart the cool thing about that is even

1035
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,200
when they're at really low levels they

1036
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,480
still release heat there's a lot of heat

1037
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,280
right yeah there's a lot of heat there

1038
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,960
and so um if we're at a at a coal mine

1039
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,599
and the air is moving itself um there's

1040
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,720
actually enough methane there so that we

1041
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,440
just heat our reactor up once and then

1042
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,640
it's self- sustaining it's carbon

1043
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,880
abatement for free which doesn't happen

1044
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,520
very often so the cost goes way down the

1045
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,800
energy requirement goes way down that

1046
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,560
means a better net greenhouse gas

1047
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,079
reduction term because you're not

1048
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,240
requiring lots of thermal energy to to

1049
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,200
destroy that methane molecule so it's

1050
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,960
exciting for for those reasons it's a

1051
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,200
really different type of carbon

1052
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,280
emissions reduction
