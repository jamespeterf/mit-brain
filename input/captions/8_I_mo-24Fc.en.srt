00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,839
Great. Uh, thank you. We're now going to

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,320
wrap up our webinar. Thanks to all of

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,200
our speakers and to everyone who joined

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,679
us today. What you heard in this session

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,160
captures what the MIT industrial liaison

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,240
program is all about. Connecting

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,480
industry with MIT researchers and

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
startups who are redefining what's

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,720
possible. Whether it's postquantum

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,359
security, AI, or other frontier

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,359
technologies. Our goal is to help member

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,239
companies understand these advances

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
early and apply them when and where they

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,680
matter most. If you'd like to learn more
