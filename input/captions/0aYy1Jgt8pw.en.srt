1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,040
you know now that I'm speaking and then

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,720
transitioning I'm going to just pause

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,160
maybe change my tone of voice for for

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,599
you Bruce but I I'm really excited that

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,400
Bruce Lawler is here Bruce is uh the an

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,520
MIT Alum uh from leaders the former

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,600
leaders from manufacturing now the

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,880
leaders for Global operations program

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,080
and he had has had a wonderful career in

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,760
Industry as an entrepreneur um in

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,240
software and now in kind of software

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,560
Hardware mix um he's the current

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,840
president for digital at at rebuild

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,000
manufacturing he's also the leader of of

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,399
mimo at MIT which is um short for

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,280
machine intelligence manufacturing

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,120
operations and he's been the U you head

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,719
of this F fascinating study that I've

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,760
been an observer of for the past few

20
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,480
years on how manufacturers are using Ai

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,600
and other forms of machine intelligence

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,399
in their work so if I had this zoomed

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,480
out high level view of manufacturing

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,280
Bruce is going to be able to zoom in and

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,120
give you a more detailed look at at

26
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,520
individual manufacturer so I'm excited

27
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,000
for your presentation Bruce and and

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,600
thanks so much for joining

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,479
thank you very much for having

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,759
me um so today I want to talk about uh

31
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,720
practical applications of AI and

32
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,799
analytics for competitive advantage and

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,840
I will um you know our objectives today

34
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,759
are going to be really to help you know

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,960
where to invest to start and sustain a

36
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,640
digital

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,799
transformation um I want to explore some

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,000
practical and successful applications of

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,240
AI and

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,560
Manufacturing and also I want want to go

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,240
over some new generative AI use cases

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,200
that are emerging

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
because you can't really have a

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,240
presentation today without generative Ai

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,719
and there are actually some really uh

46
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,320
surprisingly powerful uh applications

47
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,000
that there are merging and I think

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,920
people need to to know about them so

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,320
they can start to adopt them um I'm

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,680
going to come from as Ben said two

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,479
perspectives uh one is from rebuild

52
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,880
manufacturing and I I'll talk a little

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,840
bit more about that in a minute

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,079
and U so that's the small and to medium

55
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,840
and then medium to large is more what we

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,480
cover through our research with MIT of

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,200
um you know how is AI in analytics

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,560
really being adopted in manufacturing

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,760
and uh operations and where is it

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:28,640
growing so first of all um rebuild

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,360
manufacturing is a a new firm we coming

62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,080
up on four years old

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,440
and what we're doing is acquiring small

64
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,920
and medium um manufacturers but really

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:44,440
mostly small and building them into a

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,200
conglomerate where we think the whole is

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,640
greater than the sum of the parts by the

68
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,760
way we're assembling the different

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,280
companies but most importantly we're in

70
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,800
injecting technology uh a new management

71
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,280
style and capital to develop a new

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,440
manufacturing model one that we think

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,879
will scale uh within the US and allow us

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,640
to hit a lot of the issues that you know

75
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:13,480
both John and Ben have have talked

76
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,840
about um you know we are uh you know

77
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,840
it's very important that we have

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,879
manufacturing here as as I think you all

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
know and and Ben just said um I don't

80
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,799
think we've covered this I missed a

81
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,440
little bit of the presentations but you

82
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,000
know 98% of us manufacturers are small

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,920
and medium yet they generate almost half

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,080
of the industrial output and as Ben

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,480
mentioned you know it's about 9 to 10%

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
of the overall Workforce so it's

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,959
a you know these small and medium

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,720
manufacturers are very important and

89
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,200
we're trying to develop this new model

90
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,400
of industrialization that will work in

91
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,040
America and allow us not only to do

92
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,360
domestic production but domestic export

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,720
as as

94
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,079
well the fundamental problem that that

95
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,120
we see um isn't as much about

96
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,280
productivity although that's obviously

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,760
important but very much in the near term

98
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,920
is really a labor shortage so if you

99
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,319
just look at these numbers from June um

100
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,000
only

101
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,799
65 you close to 70% actually jobs are

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,800
filled so that leaves almost 30 35% of

103
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,880
jobs unfilled so the manufacturing

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,160
unemployment rate is at

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,759
2.4% so yeah like a third of the

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,840
positions are unfilled and that's like

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:37,199
600,000 jobs that will grow to 2.1

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,520
million by 2030 and so that uh that

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,440
concerns us greatly so for that reason

110
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,560
we need to get more productivity for

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,120
worker the second big problem we face is

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,600
the skills Gap and um you know some of

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,479
our most skilled workers are are aging

114
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,880
out um so we're losing 11,000 Americans

115
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,840
roughly per day or 4.1 million a year

116
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,320
and and I really liked what John was

117
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,280
saying it wasn't so much the handing

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,639
down of the skills but kind of leveling

119
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,840
up people but we also need a way to hand

120
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,160
the skills down um and then as this last

121
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,440
chart shows as a result of these

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,080
shortages uh wages are increasing yet

123
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,039
again driving us at a capital level to

124
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,240
try to figure out determine how do we

125
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,639
get more productivity per worker um

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,639
we're really doing three big things that

127
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,400
I think are a little different

128
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,919
um what you're hear me talk about in the

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,960
rest of the program is more on the

130
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:43,360
digital and the technology piece but we

131
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,080
think there are three main components uh

132
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,759
the first of which is kind of the tried

133
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,400
and true lean uh which is continuous

134
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,960
Improvement respect for people uh and

135
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,080
it's all about simplifying and

136
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,479
standardizing so we very much believe

137
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,639
simplify standardize then automate so

138
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,960
that's that's a core principle we have

139
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,120
to do that first and and uh rebuild as a

140
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,120
company has taken that very aggressively

141
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,240
we have a chief lean officer um and

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,880
that's driven through all of our

143
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,960
factories um very aggressively and it's

144
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,520
it's having an impact the second thing

145
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,280
um is training and and certainly John

146
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,400
covered this quite a bit um we see the

147
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,599
same gaps we've done our own training in

148
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,280
terms of lean and Six Sigma

149
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,000
fundamentally we're trying to teach

150
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,319
people how to do datadriven decision

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,720
making rather than a hunch or an opinion

152
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,840
um how they do data driven decision

153
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,440
making and then lastly there's lots of

154
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,680
tools out there that are relatively

155
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,560
simple uh just power automate is

156
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,039
a two products from Microsoft we use it

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,880
because we happen to use the Microsoft

158
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,080
Suite so powerbi for analytics power

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,160
automate just for automating repetitive

160
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:05,000
front office tasks uh then of course AWS

161
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,039
iot tools python we do use those as well

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,720
um

163
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,720
but

164
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,080
um and when you put all of those

165
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,160
together we see that does lead to

166
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,599
increased productivity so it's not just

167
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,919
one or the other it really is is all

168
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,360
three and and I think you know if

169
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,919
there's one message to take away from

170
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,840
from this talk actually it is you have

171
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,319
to think about these three steps even

172
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,840
though I'll primarily talk about the

173
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,840
digital

174
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:43,039
aspect and I won't go into great detail

175
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,080
um on this but I wanted to put these

176
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,960
slides up these are kind of the two

177
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,879
books that we at rebuild follow in terms

178
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,520
of our lean practice I wanted you to at

179
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,560
least see them and we are not talking

180
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,360
about lean as tools we are talking about

181
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,560
lean as a transformation in how you run

182
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,319
your business how you treat your people

183
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,039
how you let them lead the

184
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,720
improvements so let me show you some of

185
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,479
of the results of those three things put

186
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,759
together um this first one

187
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:19,400
is a thermoplastics composits line uh we

188
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,000
had very high scrap rates uh to the

189
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,560
point where we decided to stop

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
manufacturing uh digitize the line uh we

191
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,000
put a hundred different types of sensors

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,200
in looking at things like

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,279
um pressure temperature Uh current draw

194
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,680
thickness

195
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:44,120
and you put that system in place we

196
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,040
started the line up again um no surprise

197
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,600
that we had a similar scrap rate to

198
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,680
before but we were very quickly able to

199
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,240
drive that scrap rate down because we

200
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,480
could start to tie

201
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,000
defects to process parameters that were

202
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,000
incorrect

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,360
so super helpful and once again it was

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,480
kind of the the lean plus people

205
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,680
understanding how to use the tools uh

206
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,160
plus the digitization putting all three

207
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,480
of those things together where each one

208
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,079
alone would not have worked uh but it

209
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,040
was the summation of them that did work

210
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,200
in this

211
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,800
case this is more on the automation side

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:30,640
so um this is an example

213
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,120
of U improved scheduling and improved

214
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,120
nesting automation so this particular

215
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,160
Factory um uses laser Cuts uh sheet

216
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,920
steel among other things but this

217
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,279
particular project is about laser jet

218
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,720
and water jet cutting uh so what would

219
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,560
happen is the the in this case actually

220
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
the person running the plant would come

221
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,720
in and sort all the work orders for the

222
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,880
week um on

223
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,399
Sunday put them in batches and give them

224
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,160
to the program on Monday morning the

225
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,079
programmer would program all of the ways

226
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,920
the laser cut would cut out the sheets

227
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,880
of Steel as you can see here in this

228
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,839
diagram on the right but then we

229
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,519
wouldn't start production until Monday

230
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,920
or Monday afternoon right so you know

231
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,079
that was a waste so you combine lean

232
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,320
with how do we get rid of those wastes

233
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,440
and that what we're able to do with

234
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,680
automation

235
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,399
is

236
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
optimize the the actual batching of

237
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,720
these and the grouping putting the

238
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,560
things that are most similar together

239
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,839
this is the the thing the plant manager

240
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,000
was doing themselves we were able to do

241
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,720
it um

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,040
automatically and then uh send all that

243
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,920
work out to um to a layout program and

244
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,000
then send it to the floor so we took 10

245
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,240
hours a week out we reduced material

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,200
cost by 3% because we're get able to get

247
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,440
better utilization so those are just a

248
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,639
couple examples really from the factory

249
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,399
floor working from a small and medium

250
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,000
Enterprise

251
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,000
so now I I'll talk about the research

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
work that Ben mentioned um and it's part

253
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,600
overall of what we do at MIT mimo uh

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,959
we're really about finding the shortest

255
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,920
path from data to

256
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:21,399
impact and in what we do in mimo is we

257
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,440
really have three uh main pillars um

258
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,240
research education and

259
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,839
collaboration uh

260
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,200
so the research is the type of research

261
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,399
I'll talk about today but we also do uh

262
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,720
projects for major major manufacturers

263
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,880
like Nissan and

264
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,240
um um Analog Devices we actually also do

265
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,440
a project for uh meta on how to

266
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,920
optimize um data center operations which

267
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,839
is another type of operations so we we

268
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,440
it's not just manufacturing it's it's

269
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,000
operations for at large uh education

270
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,079
I'll talk a little bit more well

271
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,600
education is certainly today and then

272
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,079
collaboration I'll talk about our

273
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,760
symposium

274
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,560
and we are part of the leaders for

275
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,880
Global operations program which I'll

276
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,000
talk a little bit about as we go through

277
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,160
this and I will I I will bounce back and

278
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,480
forth between research and some of these

279
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,199
different programs because I want you to

280
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,279
see uh the resources that are available

281
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:21,120
to you and things that you can

282
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,959
participate in learn from actively

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,480
collaborate with others because we think

284
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,199
collaboration is super important so

285
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,040
you'll see me kind of move up and down

286
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:33,399
and I also will put some QR codes up so

287
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,040
you guys can um email me and um we can

288
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,880
get you to be part of the

289
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,199
conversation so this is the study that

290
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,959
Ben mentioned it's a longitudinal study

291
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:46,079
we ran the first study in

292
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,240
2021 uh we finished one in

293
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,639
2023 uh and then we're kicking another

294
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,880
one off actually right now so we'd love

295
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,240
to have some of you participate or most

296
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,160
of you um and we do this in

297
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,320
collaboration with McKenzie Andy

298
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,639
because it helps us get both the

299
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,680
academic and the business perspective uh

300
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,720
when we look at the the companies it's

301
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,800
literally everything from McDonald's to

302
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:19,000
Vista Print um Amgen Analog Devices I

303
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:22,240
mentioned and we look at specific

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,920
kpis different use cases the types of

305
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,279
business outcomes that people are trying

306
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,120
to achieve and then we look at the

307
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,120
enablers the types of things that

308
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,680
um that you do so it's the the people

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,639
you hire the data you collect your

310
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,120
governance practices are these enablers

311
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,220
and obviously the money you

312
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,560
spend so what we've found

313
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,720
[Music]

314
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:54,160
um is

315
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:59,120
that there's a big Delta in KP

316
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,480
performance um so in 2021 leaders who

317
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,519
who used Ai and leaders we Define as the

318
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,839
top quartile and we're we're presenting

319
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,000
them the top quartile versus the the

320
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:13,720
bottom two quartile so 2021 there were

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,440
roughly three times better uh

322
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,680
performance and then by 2023 we saw it

323
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Forex so the leaders are starting to

324
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,279
pull away they were already ahead but

325
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,360
that's

326
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,880
accelerating and from what we can see

327
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,000
that Trend will continue um

328
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,120
for the leaders to accelerate I'll talk

329
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,199
a little bit more about some of the uh

330
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,120
the bright spots that I think are are

331
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,360
good so if you're not a leader today um

332
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,199
it's actually a great time to start so

333
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,160
and I'll go into that in a

334
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,000
minute excuse me so we look at 21

335
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,639
different uh

336
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,480
kpis um from efficiency to cost Revenue

337
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,040
obviously responsiveness lead time

338
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,560
things like that customer experience net

339
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,120
promoter score um energy performance

340
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,759
energy utilization so it's a pretty

341
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
broad evaluation of the types of things

342
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,160
we look

343
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,199
at and and that's what we're seeing as

344
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,399
as the

345
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,480
results um how do the leaders get those

346
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,040
kinds of results and here you see a very

347
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,000
stunning difference in training so

348
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,040
amplifying what John has excuse me John

349
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
had said so the leaders in this chart

350
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,399
are shown in in black and the bottom two

351
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,440
cor tiles are shown in uh the light blue

352
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,399
so leaders have very heavy training for

353
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,839
engineers division leaders managers

354
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,759
Executives and line workers across the

355
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,480
board

356
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:49,639
um whereas we find the bottom two ctil

357
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,199
simply do not do that and we think that

358
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:55,839
um it's that training in digital

359
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:58,600
Technologies at all levels and the fact

360
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,000
that the leaders do trust as a result of

361
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,440
this trend they actually trust their

362
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,360
employees and they give them the tools

363
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,399
like

364
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,639
um you know powerbi Etc excuse me just

365
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,639
one

366
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,279
second I apologize it's allergy season

367
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,560
here um

368
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,000
so and what John was talking about is

369
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,000
more this line worker training and you

370
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,360
can see that for the vast majority uh

371
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,560
they can't afford to have their own

372
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,639
programs so what he's was talking about

373
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,639
is super impactful in my

374
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,839
view another thing that leaders do well

375
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:44,480
that make them uh separate out is that

376
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:50,079
um they collect data

377
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:53,399
and so the way to read this chart is um

378
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,519
they collect almost 60% of them collect

379
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,600
data on more than half of their

380
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,959
equipment so uh you know a significant

381
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,079
amount of data and and what we find is

382
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,439
that the more data you collect the

383
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,799
better you treat your data the cleaner

384
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,240
it is the more tools you have to do

385
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,959
something with it so they all they all

386
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,120
kind of uh relate to one another but you

387
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,000
know it's just better organization and

388
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,880
and better scalability and and data is

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,319
very much like especially in an AI

390
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,000
context like a factory I think we all

391
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,000
know that if I put a robot in the middle

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,760
of a factory and I don't automate what

393
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,080
comes into the robot or what goes out of

394
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,840
the robot I don't get the effectiveness

395
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,000
out of the robot that I would like data

396
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,160
is the same way machine learning needs

397
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,400
to learn across the whole process and

398
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,280
have you know a labeled data set is what

399
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,080
we would call it but a a good bad

400
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,480
indication at the end of the line and so

401
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,520
if I only do one cell in the middle and

402
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,840
then I don't do an inspection until much

403
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,120
much later it's very hard for me to to

404
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,200
know what process actually caused the

405
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,440
problem so you know collecting data and

406
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,039
and doing some level of checking along

407
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,640
the way whether it's a test of some sort

408
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,120
is very important to have data improve

409
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,039
your overall process so you if you can

410
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,320
chain it all together that's the best

411
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,720
but the more processes you put together

412
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,080
the better and and that's what you're

413
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:35,799
seeing in this this data here

414
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:40,240
um no surprise uh leaders uh spend more

415
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:42,640
um and they've been at it longer so

416
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,650
although not as much as you would think

417
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,840
so

418
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,799
[Music]

419
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,360
um if you look at leaders stand out here

420
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,200
in terms of they're representing light

421
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,080
blue here um you know they've greatly

422
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,480
accelerated their investment uh but in

423
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,600
the other categories it's not not quite

424
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,760
as as big so you know everybody's

425
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,799
accelerating but the the leaders the way

426
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:13,000
to read this is the leaders are doubling

427
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:15,480
down right and that the the time frame

428
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,760
that they're getting those object is a

429
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,799
little bit quicker than others

430
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,360
so accelerate investment based on a

431
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,799
positive outcome so if you're not

432
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,440
accelerating your investments in Ai and

433
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,360
machine learning then obviously you're

434
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,360
you're going to fall

435
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,919
behind so another very important thing

436
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:43,039
that leaders do is they focus on common

437
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,720
vision and common use cases and why is

438
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,159
that important there are some things

439
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,840
that Ai and machine learning are better

440
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,520
at than others and also there are

441
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,799
several places where there's lots of

442
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,360
tools that are available

443
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,280
so you'll see here in a moment I'll talk

444
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,080
about

445
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,760
the tool usage and the availability of

446
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,360
of vendors to do things and that's super

447
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,720
important because unless you're one of

448
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,120
the top companies it's very difficult to

449
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,320
attract um data scientists and data

450
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,520
analytics people and and to pay them a

451
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,360
competitive wage it's it's just harder

452
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,280
and harder to justify so what you see

453
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,080
here is uh you know

454
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,120
forecasting uh Transportation Logistics

455
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,280
optimization and predictive maintenance

456
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,559
are three of the top use cases that

457
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,799
everyone does or the leaders all do in

458
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,679
this particular case and then there's a

459
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,480
whole group that most of them

460
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,679
do and so for any of you starting on

461
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,640
your journey I would certainly suggest

462
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,720
picking things that other people are

463
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,559
already doing um you've got better

464
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,760
benchmarks and better

465
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:57,480
tools and

466
00:20:52,760 --> 00:21:00,080
so this is just a small snapshot um what

467
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,520
we do for all our participants is we

468
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,360
make a customized Playbook uh for

469
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:11,840
everybody or for each participant and it

470
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,720
shows how you performed it's proprietary

471
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,799
to you no one else sees it um how you

472
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,400
performed against the rest of the uh

473
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,000
your industry and and the rest of the

474
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,840
participants overall but more

475
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,080
importantly than than benchmarking is

476
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,080
it's really designed to give you a guide

477
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,640
of what things you should think about

478
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,960
next so you know if you end up being an

479
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,520
emerger in our category we have four

480
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,120
categories I didn't get into it uh and

481
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,440
you can read more about this if you go

482
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,200
to our website uh there's links to

483
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,000
Harvard Business review article there's

484
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,720
some links to other articles where you

485
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,320
can learn more about the study

486
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,360
um but we group people into four

487
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,200
categories and you essentially

488
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,760
transition from one to the next and we

489
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,520
give you some guidance on what you might

490
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,520
want to think about next like training

491
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,559
as an example or data data collection

492
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,880
right so uh this is available I'll give

493
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,640
you a link here at the end on how to

494
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,200
participate in the study and and we'll

495
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:19,360
generate this playbook for

496
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:21,080
you um so another resource that that we

497
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,880
have in as part of the leaders for

498
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,960
Global operations program is a use case

499
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,799
library because the question that's

500
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,360
often asked is well how do you use it

501
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,400
what does that mean um what kind of

502
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,559
results can I get how should I approach

503
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,960
it and so in conjunction with the

504
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,279
leaders for Global operation program and

505
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,720
these manufacturers we we're creating

506
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,440
this use case

507
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,760
Library uh based on a six-month on-site

508
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,919
research program so the lgo program the

509
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,760
students get a master's in engineering

510
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,559
and an MBA from Sloan and as part of

511
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,000
their two-year program they go onsite to

512
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,840
one of these companies listed here

513
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,480
and essentially do research Implement

514
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,799
some solutions and then uh see the

515
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,200
results and write a thesis and so that's

516
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:16,480
what's captured in this use case library

517
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,520
and to give you an example I said

518
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,000
forecasting is one of the top use cases

519
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,480
right and so here I went into the

520
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:31,080
database and found uh six uh thesis that

521
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,000
address AI in forecasting and the the

522
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,120
three big themes were how do I increase

523
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,679
sales how do I reduce in inventory and

524
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,640
how do I use

525
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,200
um uh forecasting to inform where I

526
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,200
should invest so some of these are

527
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,279
really kind of Interest some you would

528
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,880
predict and some are pretty interesting

529
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,200
like one of the partner companies

530
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,679
predicts garment Siz mix based on the

531
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,159
text description and characteristics of

532
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,279
the Garment that they've designed so

533
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,440
they design a new garment they write up

534
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,159
a description of it they characterize it

535
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
you know in short sleeve long sleeve

536
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,240
pattern whatever and then the algorithm

537
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,440
predicts how many small mediums and

538
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,799
larges or two four sixes and eights they

539
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,240
should make of that particular uh of

540
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,880
that particular um design um you know

541
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,080
another one at the bottom informing

542
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,960
investment is uh how do I predict EV

543
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,919
charging demand so I know where I need

544
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,360
to build additional

545
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,320
distribution facilities for my

546
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,000
electricity

547
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,200
so a wide range of things I won't go

548
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,320
into all of them right now but I think

549
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,600
you get the idea of the the broad

550
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,120
types I guess the big takeaway from this

551
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,360
slide is there's lots of different ways

552
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:52,480
to use AI in manufacturing it's not just

553
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,840
a chatbot for generative Ai and

554
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,320
predictive maintenance uh which is kind

555
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:02,880
of what people tend to gravitate to uh

556
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,600
generally so I want to give you a couple

557
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,760
of case studies from our past mimo

558
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:14,440
Symposium so every year we run uh AI

559
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,240
accelerate impact um uh at mit's campus

560
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:22,000
we hosted in conjunction with

561
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:24,360
manufacturing at MIT so um ours will be

562
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,600
May 6 and their Symposium will be May

563
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,039
7th uh we'll focus on AI and

564
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,120
Manufacturing and they focus on on uh

565
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,559
new manufa Advanced manufacturing

566
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,640
technology and policy uh and we uh we

567
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,840
host AI

568
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,279
acceleration accelerate impact in

569
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,399
conjunction with Cale so we bring not

570
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:47,559
only the the best of manufacturing but

571
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:50,679
the best of AI uh from within MIT

572
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,279
together uh for this Symposium so uh

573
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,520
I'll have a link at the end hopefully

574
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,159
you'll be able to join us but I'll now

575
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,000
give you an idea of of some of the

576
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
things that we talk about

577
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:07,640
so North American stainless uh sits on

578
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,360
the Ohio River south of Cincinnati um

579
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,039
normally you would think it's not a very

580
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,240
Advanced company they make stainless

581
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:20,799
steel for beer kegs and refrigerators

582
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:23,360
they bring in um scrap um stainless

583
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,520
steel and then they convert it into

584
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,520
these different products and they do it

585
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:33,480
in massive U foundary furnaces like this

586
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:37,399
that you know the electricity demand is

587
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,399
almost half of of their expense so being

588
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,160
more efficient is is obviously very

589
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,760
important to

590
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,200
[Music]

591
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,600
them what's really interesting about

592
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,520
them

593
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,720
is they have six people in their data

594
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:57,720
science team out of 1,400 employees but

595
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,760
they have 70 employees that are um data

596
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,919
literate they can write a SQL search

597
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,760
they can do um you know use analytical

598
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:09,360
tools do those kinds of tools

599
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,960
which shouldn't surprise you I want all

600
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,679
of you to think just for a minute how

601
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,159
many sensors do you think they have

602
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,960
throughout this Factory that they ingest

603
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,880
into their data

604
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,240
Pipeline and I know we can't really do

605
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,799
raise of hands but I want you to think

606
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,399
of a number before I tell you the answer

607
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,399
the answer is 30,000 so there's 30,000

608
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:31,159
sensors throughout this platform Pro

609
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:34,960
Factory and so that presents a problem

610
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,880
for them of how to know where to focus

611
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,399
and so they've partnered and I'll

612
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,559
emphasize you know some different people

613
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:45,880
you can partner with but in this case

614
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:48,440
falconry and they've taken these um data

615
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,200
points in they've looked at historical

616
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,840
data seen what kind of fluctuations are

617
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,559
normal based on Seasons demands Etc and

618
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,960
then they're able to figure determine

619
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:03,320
which ones are abnormal so doing anomaly

620
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,880
detection and so in this particular

621
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,760
chart the yellow are anomalies and

622
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,760
essentially what we're trying to do with

623
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,760
this cloud-based ml product is to blow

624
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,480
away the hay and leave me with a stack

625
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,880
of needles that quote actually came from

626
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,480
the senior VP of manufacturing at Nissan

627
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,720
on a project we were doing there but

628
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,360
it's the same thing here when something

629
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,760
starts to not be

630
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,200
right I'm not at the point where I can

631
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,200
have ai correct it but I can certainly

632
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,279
have ai help me where to go look and so

633
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,919
in this particular case at the timestamp

634
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,840
shown in red I would start to look at

635
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,720
things that are in yellow because they

636
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,799
are statistically different from what

637
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,960
I've seen over the last two years and

638
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,960
that's super valuable in terms of of

639
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,960
troubleshooting so I'll switch now I've

640
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:02,480
got uh a few minutes left here um to

641
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,919
talk about generative Ai and large

642
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,840
language model um types of applications

643
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,440
there's really three big ones I'll talk

644
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,200
about so multiple choice Innovation um

645
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,600
today when you think about design you

646
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,600
design toward one Optimum what you'll

647
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:24,279
see in the future is you will Design

648
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:26,519
many things um generatively and then use

649
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,640
machine learning to help you down select

650
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,960
which ones are better

651
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,399
um and you can actually if you're even

652
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,760
more sophisticated you can use

653
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:36,840
reinforcement learning to help you

654
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,240
actually sort through those even faster

655
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,480
um I think we've all seen task

656
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,360
automation of of just what generative AI

657
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,240
can do today primarily in terms of words

658
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,880
um but there are lots of tasks that that

659
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,600
certainly we can think about automating

660
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,559
um and and many of them have constraints

661
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,000
so I can test whether I have a good

662
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,080
output or not and that's that's very

663
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,120
important and then the last one is a

664
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,600
co-pilot for workers how do I help less

665
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,880
skilled workers become more skilled how

666
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:13,240
do I bring the expertise of the many uh

667
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,880
to the the the vital

668
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,320
few so the first uh multi- Choice

669
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,159
Innovation uh this use case is actually

670
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:27,720
from BMW although these are not BMWs the

671
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,559
objective is to design uh a a new design

672
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,720
and

673
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,039
I I pick on the Pontiac Aztec because

674
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,960
it's particularly unappealing design but

675
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:38,720
in this case generative

676
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,240
AI generated a set of designs that are

677
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,399
likely to be desirable uh based on a a

678
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,159
diffusion model essentially was doing

679
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:51,519
this and then they also trained a

680
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,480
classifier to predict uh consumer

681
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,840
preference so they had people look at

682
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,279
different designs and determine which

683
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,279
ones they liked and then this class fire

684
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:03,200
was able to uh predict what it thought

685
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,440
people would say so in this case you

686
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,600
know it's like a Chevy Tahoe people

687
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,440
rated it 2.44 preference uh the model

688
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,240
predicted 2.27 same thing for I don't

689
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,120
know what the lower one is maybe a Ford

690
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,200
Explorer um type of thing and then use

691
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,960
that classifier to look back at all

692
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,679
these designs that were generated and

693
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,039
Bubble Up the ones that seemed like

694
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,240
humans would like the best and then

695
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,919
designers can use that as as a starting

696
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,919
point for new

697
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:40,639
designs um this next use case is super

698
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,639
impactful it's from uh the Panasonic

699
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:47,480
North parasonic energy of North America

700
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:51,159
Factory in Reno Nevada uh they make 5.5

701
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,000
million battery cells a day um a lot of

702
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:56,039
them go into Teslas or maybe all of them

703
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,440
go into Teslas or Tesla products um they

704
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,440
have 350 maintenance technicians uh

705
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,279
servicing these machines the machines

706
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,880
have you know about 10,000 Parts each

707
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,320
and they have a hundred of them so it's

708
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,320
a lot to maintain and what they were

709
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,399
able to

710
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,159
do

711
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:19,159
um I'll give you two examples so this

712
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,679
first one was they recorded maintenance

713
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,399
technicians doing different

714
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,840
tasks

715
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,039
um and then it was able to automatically

716
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,080
generate document ation it did captures

717
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,120
out of the video it transcribed the the

718
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,919
text and allowed it to quickly generate

719
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,120
documentation on how to do something

720
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,600
whatever the thing was so they could

721
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,279
very quickly create documentation and

722
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,080
then that is still reviewed by a human

723
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:50,039
but it takes much much less time to

724
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,639
review and edit than to create and and

725
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,960
do screen grabs out of it and and this

726
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:57,559
was in

727
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:01,159
um partnership with pal paler using

728
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:04,600
their AI industrial base plate

729
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,200
product uh this next one is AI powered

730
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,080
maintenance and repair so what they did

731
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,720
here is they they took uh a million

732
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,960
trouble tickets so what was the problem

733
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,480
and what was the description and then

734
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,600
what was done and they trained an a

735
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,320
generative AI model

736
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:29,080
to give guidance to these 350

737
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,880
maintenance technicians and so

738
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,399
now they're able to bring somebody in

739
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,720
and that isn't as familiar and really

740
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,159
reduce the amount of wrench time uh

741
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,760
onboard people um you know instead of

742
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,519
years down to months

743
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,480
so you know it does help them solve real

744
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,639
issues uh because if any of you have

745
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,279
been to Reno it's not necessarily A A

746
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:58,320
manufacturing base this is one of the

747
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,519
the comparatively few manufactur firms

748
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,519
there so they had to bring people from

749
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,919
hospitality and other Industries and

750
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:09,880
train them to to be in these roles so

751
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,880
tools like this are super important for

752
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,440
them so got a few minutes left I'll talk

753
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,399
what's new uh what's coming and or here

754
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,440
um so we've all well maybe not but uh

755
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,079
it's a thing called a foundation model

756
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,280
which is some of these more basic models

757
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,320
that are the foundation of other things

758
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,079
and so we're training new ones so a

759
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:36,200
company called Landing AI is making

760
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:38,399
domain specific large Vision models so

761
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,359
if I look at the vision models that are

762
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,599
trained today they're trained on uh

763
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,200
General things from throughout the

764
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,879
internet

765
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:53,119
and you know bananas trees dogs cats Etc

766
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:55,960
and then we try to use them to do things

767
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,880
in for this in this case semiconductor

768
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,680
Wafers well I think we know that in a

769
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,839
factory things look different so what

770
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,720
Landing AI is doing is they're training

771
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:09,000
Foundation models based on the things

772
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,000
you see in a factory so now it's more

773
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,359
able to recognize the things you see in

774
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,359
a factory uh what ground light is doing

775
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:20,440
is they're using visual language models

776
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:23,040
to to interpret ask questions of scenes

777
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,720
and get answers back and so we're now in

778
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,720
an age where we can ask what the the

779
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,599
measurement is on an instrument so I

780
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,200
actually put a camera on a gauge and get

781
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:38,079
a reading of it um

782
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,320
using new generative AI models and so

783
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,440
they're a company working in that area

784
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,160
and then what sensible is doing is a

785
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,680
video language model so they're looking

786
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,520
at video and you can ask questions of

787
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,800
the video of what is going on and that

788
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,520
can specifically be used to characterize

789
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,520
assembly operations here it's a

790
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,960
logistics operation so these are what

791
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,960
what's coming um they're actually in

792
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,680
some cases here today um you know

793
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,520
generative CAD we're seeing more there

794
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,119
this

795
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,119
is CAD files generated from text prompts

796
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,040
why is that important because we're

797
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,000
seeing that large language models can

798
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,880
generate code um you know they can

799
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,200
generate python C all things that

800
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,720
co-pilot that's actually one of the

801
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,720
first and most popular applications so

802
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,359
now imagine we can train it to write

803
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,359
code that then

804
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:35,400
writes CAD files so I'm almost finished

805
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,599
here I know I'm at time um draft Aid

806
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,400
they make uh 3D

807
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,000
models or they take 3D models and

808
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,560
produce 2D production drawings from them

809
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,440
which we all need out in our factories

810
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,079
and then uh two companies doing uh

811
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,160
generative tool path creation so

812
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,839
certainly at rebuild and other companies

813
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,960
CNC programming is a bottleneck

814
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:03,359
companies are starting to use that um

815
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,760
using generative AI to create their new

816
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,119
tool paths for CNC

817
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,359
programming so with that I'd like to

818
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:13,640
invite you to join the conversation you

819
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:17,440
can either uh go to that URL memo.

820
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:21,000
mit.edu cont or hit that QR code with

821
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,680
your camera and tell us that uh you know

822
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,400
you'd like to participate in the study

823
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,319
we would love to have you no matter

824
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,480
where in the world you are or what

825
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:31,520
you're Your Role is and then we'd love

826
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:36,000
to have you attend this Symposium on May

827
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,640
the 6th 2025 in Cambridge thank you

828
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,960
wonderful thanks so much Bruce and I

829
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,680
think you're you're kind of you have a

830
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,680
wealth of examples and uh not only

831
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,079
examples of you know what we might think

832
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,119
of as uh applications of narrow Ai and

833
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
Manufacturing but also just examples of

834
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,680
you know good data science and and how

835
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,400
to build the workforce to support these

836
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,319
types of Technologies so thank you very

837
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,319
much for sharing
