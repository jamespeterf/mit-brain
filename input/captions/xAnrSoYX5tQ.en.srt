12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
measure levels of methane in the air as

Plata an associate professor of civil

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,560
and environmental engineering at MIT has

30
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,600
developed tools aimed at reducing

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,439
methane emissions the good news she says

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,759
is that because methane is short-lived

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,720
compared to CO2 cutting methane could

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,000
have a fast beneficial effect on

strategies and policies the goal is to

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:50,040
cut emissions by 45% by 2030 which would

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,360
save up to 0.5° C of warming by 2100 by

plate was driving with her mom through

00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,880
her rural Hometown a short distance from

51
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,879
the Atlantic coast it struck her that

52
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,680
many of the people they knew were sick

53
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,440
some with cancer some with what turned

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
out to be neurological diseases I said

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,760
it's got to be something everybody

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
shares Mom some residents didn't want to

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,080
believe they were being sickened by the

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,040
family-owned mckin company a 7 acre

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,400
liquid waste disposal site that stored

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,440
and buried toxic fuels solvents and

61
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,239
chemicals such as Tri chloroethylene

62
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,160
in 1977 the EPA confirmed that the

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,680
chemicals had leeched into private Wells

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,480
contaminating the groundwater the thing

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,239
that is really drawn me to environmental

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,319
science and engineering is that this is

67
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,200
a small town and the people who owned

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,760
that facility were family friends Plata

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,680
says it made me realize that we as

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
scientists need to do a better job

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,680
helping Industries identify more

74
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,680

oceanography in grad school I asked my

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,640
professors if I could poke around the

81
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,280
other engineering Labs at MIT and ask

82
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,440
people what they were making how they

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,159
were making it and how an environmental

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,720
engineer might help them make their

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,640
sustainable from the start she says

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,640
that's the underlying theme of all that

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,680
I do help people build better

demand catalyzing a

108
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,720
solution Plata's primary teaching focus

109
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,400
is aquatic sciences and water

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,280
engineering her knowledge of

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
oceanography got her thinking about how

112
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,160
to neutralize methane the way certain

113
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,440
ocean dwelling microbes do by processing

114
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,840
it before it escapes into the oceans in

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,759
the atmosphere when Plata and colleagues

116
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,000
measured methane leaks from natural gas

117
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,120
infrastructure the overall levels coming

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,440
from distribution pipelines were small

119
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,759
yet the problem was pervasive we were

120
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,880
thinking what engineered way could we

121
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,560
take this low-level methane and turn it

122
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,160
into something else Plata's lab found

123
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,400
that passing methane through a heated

124
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,280
zeolite a clay like material with a

125
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,199
consistency between baby powder and cat

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,320
litter can help convert methane into CO2

127
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,320
without a match or any other combustion

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,440
process converting methane to CO2 may

129
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,120
sound like a bad idea but because

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
methane is the more onerous contributor

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,800
to Global in it ends up being a net

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,240
benefit and because methane is much more

133
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,880
dilute than CO2 the relative CO2

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,000
contribution is minuscule she says

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,039
initially Plata's team envisioned

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,400
incorporating zeolite into household air

137
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,720
filters but they decided to focus on the

138
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,199
biggest methane offenders Dairy Barns

139
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,840
and coal mines the first time Plata

140
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,680
tored a large indoor livestock facility

141
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,720
she was struck by the enormity of the

142
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,960
air moving systems that keep the cow's

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,360
air fresh and germ free the sheer volume

144
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,160
is astronomical it's like 10 tractor

145
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,360
trailers moving past you in 5 seconds

146
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,199
that's our chief technical challenge

147
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,319
getting huge volumes of air through the

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,400
zeolite she says at the moment potential

149
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,840
Solutions are too energy intensive for

150
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,800
platus Taste when you're proposing a

151
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,280
climate technology you don't want to eat

152
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,880
up more fossil fuels than you're going

153
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,680
to offset she says but it's early days

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,720
and plenty of strategies are left to

155
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,639
explore the payoff could be significant

156
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,360
deploying the technology and ventilation

157
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,479
shafts at coal mines would have such a

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,479
big effect it could start to measurably

159
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,759
reduce atmospheric levels of methane

160
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,800
almost immediately and if you could

161
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,440
deploy the filters at Dairy barns you'd

162
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,599
solve the methane warming problem she

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,440
says it's equivalent to taking all the

164
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,919
combustion engine vehicles in the entire

165
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,240
world off the road times

166
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,840
three we want to fix this as an engineer

167
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,840
working on real world Solutions plot

168
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,680
strives to design innovations that

169
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,160
companies want to adopt because they're

170
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,400
better for the environment

171
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,280
they perform better and also because

172
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,400
they cost less than existing

173
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,160
technology however even with her

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,199
emphasis on cost co-optimization Plata

175
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,360
has noticed a shift in how corporations

176
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,560
and individuals view potential costs

177
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,400
associated with sustainability there's

178
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,800
been a huge swing in the desire to spend

179
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,319
a little extra money to prevent

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,319
environmental damage today people will

181
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,400
come to us and say we want to fix this

182
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,039
problem because of the environment and

183
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,720
even if it costs us a little bit more

184
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,319
we're willing to do it when Plata think

185
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,960
back on what happened in Maine she

186
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,800
doesn't believe the mckin company was

187
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,879
evil or even hiding the truth a lot of

188
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,240
the time she says polluters don't know

189
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,639
about the effect they're having on the

190
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,639
environment or if they know they don't

191
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,280
know how to fix it that's where our

192
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,280
expertise can come in pla says we can

193
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,599
say let's think about this problem a

194
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,680
little differently how do we get you the

195
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,879
function you want without the damage one

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,800
of the things my background and

197
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,680
upbringing have taught me is industry

198
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,879
and the people within industry these are

199
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,639
your neighbors and they probably want

200
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:37,240
the right outcome if you can innovate

201
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,240
with them or help guide them to that
