started with our panel discussion uh

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,120
we have structured this discussion uh to

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,679
leave a lot of time for questions and

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,920
answers and discussion from the floor

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,840
so this afternoon we've heard about ways

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,840
in which open courseware

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,880
and similar resources

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,039
are being transformational in how people

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,279
get access to information and how they

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
use it

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640

please help

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
so i wanted to start by saying how i

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,200
feel

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,360
what i want to say is to yell we did it

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
so

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
so

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,680
and that comes

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
and that comes with a

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
a certain amount amount of pride susan

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,799
you heard susan mention

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,200
a little while ago that we have mit

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,600
students using open courseware

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,000
in teaching mit courses at places around

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
the world including china one of those

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
cities is dalian

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
so the students are

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
going to die and learning that it's not

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
enough to change light bulbs

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
and

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
a lot of people have a lot of friends

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
here in dalian

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
but the main

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
the main emotion i feel right now

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,959
is one of tremendous humility

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,560
and it's a sense of

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,120
how tiny a step we have made

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,280
and how tiny a part

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,920
of this transformation is mit open

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,760
courseware tom talked about

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,640
the change from globalization 1.0 to

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,599
this

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,920
other

77
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,560
amazing emerging thing that's happening

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,400
and i think what mit opencourseware has

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
led us to do is to

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
see that we're in something like

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
education 1.0 we weren't we couldn't

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,680
even see that before

83
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,480
and now the question is what comes next

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,319
what

85
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,920
what are the opportunities that come

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,440
what what are the things that having

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,239
gotten to this point we can't predict

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
but we can maybe maybe try to imagine

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,200
and we have

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,680
a tremendous panel of three people to

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,159
help us imagine it uh sam patrotta is

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,879
chairman and ceo of world tell limited

93
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,040
he's science he was science advisor to

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,800
uh prime minister rajiv gandhi and was

95
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,799
responsible then for india's foreign and

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
domestic

97
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,080
telecommunications policies

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,640
he's been a force for innovation since

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,120
the 1960s when he invented what's

100
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,120
considered the first electronic

101
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
diary one of the first examples of

102
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
handheld computing he's particularly

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
known for having introduced

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,280
microprocessors and telephone switches

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,640
sam is widely considered

106
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
to be

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
responsible for india's communications

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
revolution and this began with a crusade

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,120
in the 1980s where he worked for prime

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
minister indira gandhi on a one rupee a

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,040
year salary where he put together a team

112
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,760
of professionals a digital switching

113
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,599
system set up rural exchanges

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,040
set up the factories that made the fiber

115
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,480
optic cables

116
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,000
introduced automatic dialing

117
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,040
international dialing in 1980

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,720
india had about a million telephones

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,879
altogether

120
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,600
and by 2000 three-quarters of india's

121
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
half-million villagers had phone service

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,199
sam is currently chairman of india's

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,720
national knowledge commission which is a

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,880
high-level advisory committee to the

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,199
prime minister whose objective is to

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,600
transform india into a knowledge society

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
he is passionate about the hunger for

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
education in india and the fact that

129
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,280
education is the key to economic

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
transformation

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
and that the key to that is the

132
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,880
expansion of universities and colleges

133
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,639
and he's often quoted as saying why does

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,639
india have uh

135
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,600
seven iits when we could have 70.

136
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,639
john celie brown is the inspirational

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
seer

138
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,479
for the age of people and information

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,560
he's he's been chief scientist of the

140
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
xerox corporation

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
a position he held for 20 years director

142
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,560
of xerox palo alto research center when

143
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,720
that was the leading computer science

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
research center in the world

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
he was the first computing research

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,360
manager to really focus on the profound

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,560
relations between information technology

148
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,720
and social issues and to bring

149
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
sociologists and architects into the

150
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,479
computing research community he's

151
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
written widely on research management

152
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,720
and on innovation and on the human

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,400
context in which information technology

154
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
is embedded

155
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
john's leadership in technology goes

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,360
back to the 60s when he created what is

157
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,039
still one of the world's best examples

158
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
of artificial intelligence-based

159
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,240
computing tutoring

160
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,320
and he maintained that during his years

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,919
at xerox when he was co-founder of the

162
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,600
xerox institute for research and

163
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,440
learning and it persists to the present

164
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
day with his thoughts and writing on how

165
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,360
the net is changing the fundamental

166
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
relations between

167
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,840
people and knowledge and between

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,840
learning and society

169
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,919
i've been asked to do many silly things

170
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,759
when i've been at mit but

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,440
ranking up there was the silliest is the

172
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,840
idea that i would be introducing chuck

173
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,360
vest to an mit audience

174
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,240
so let me just say that people talked a

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,759
lot about the genesis of open courseware

176
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,400
and i won't repeat that but i do want to

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,120
say it was chuck and his administration

178
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,880
who took this nutty idea that was

179
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,319
presented by a bunch of faculty and

180
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,560
glued that to a sense of a institutional

181
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,120
vision and a sense of the civic

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
responsibility of a university in the

183
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
modern age

184
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
but i've got to say that as honored as

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,039
we are

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,960
to have our guests the real honor is you

187
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,600
both the people who've made it but all

188
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,520
also many of the leaders of the open

189
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,639
educational resources community who are

190
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,560
here

191
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,919
so we don't want this to be a one-way

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,919
discussion of hearing great thoughts

193
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,039
this is really meant to be a discussion

194
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,960
and a hope

195
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,960
that maybe we can all

196
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,919
together start imagining something this

197
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,120
afternoon that'll take us from this

198
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,039
education 1.0 finally seen in a global

199
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
context to something that could be much

200
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,479
much greater

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,560
so chuck let me ask you to start

202
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,560
thank you

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,199
the views i'm going to express are

204
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,960
solely my own and neither those of mit

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,759
nor the nae

206
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,800
i'd like to begin sneaking up on the

207
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
future

208
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,520
by looking back

209
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,000
very briefly at the beginning

210
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,400
and looking at the present and

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,759
giving you my idea of what some of the

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,199
big forces are out there

213
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
first of all the question in 1999 when

214
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
all of this

215
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,400
started

216
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,680
was

217
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,199
were residential universities dying

218
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
dinosaurs

219
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,000
and

220
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,319
would information technology and

221
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,840
so-called distance learning

222
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,599
render residential universities obsolete

223
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,319
and by the way

224
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,160
was there a great opportunity for

225
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,039
universities to make a whole lot of

226
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,319
money by teaching other people at a

227
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,759
distance

228
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,680
mediated by information technology

229
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,599
and the answer that mit's faculty gave

230
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
to that was of course

231
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,120
ocw

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,560
so at the time

233
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,599
mit's open courseware initiative was

234
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,879
absolutely counter to the trends of the

235
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
day

236
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,520
it was revolutionary

237
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,919
and tom i don't know we used the word

238
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,000
harm but we certainly knew it was risky

239
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,360
revolutionary and risky

240
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,240
and it was entirely consistent

241
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,479
with mit's culture

242
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,200
and tradition if it weren't for that we

243
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,959
wouldn't be sitting here today

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,399
and also to me

245
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,120
the fact that ocw is actually realized

246
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,480
and funded at least up to this point

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,640
demonstrates the power of a good idea

248
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,720
if you have a really good idea in

249
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,279
today's world and in this great nation

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,000
you can still find a way to do it

251
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,839
and above all i always viewed and i

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,560
think my colleagues did

253
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,720
ocw as an adventure we really didn't

254
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,800
know where it was going to lead when we

255
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,000
started out and you'll hear lots more

256
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,839
about where it has led today

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,720
so some personal beliefs and

258
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,959
observations about all of this

259
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,760
i'm a great believer in fact i'm in love

260
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,839
with the residential university because

261
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,760
i still believe that nothing can

262
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
actually replace

263
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,040
the magic that occurs when you get a

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,920
bunch of bright motivated diverse young

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,720
men and women around 18 19 20 years of

266
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,440
age

267
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,839
coming together living learning in a

268
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,399
very intense environment

269
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,519
teaching and learning no matter how they

270
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,760
occur

271
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,240
are really deeply human activities and i

272
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,360
think as we try to understand the

273
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,640
potential for technology and all this we

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,839
must remember

275
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,880
teaching and learning are deeply human

276
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,360
activities but

277
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,600
there is also no question then and

278
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,240
certainly no question now

279
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,640
that computers and communications that

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,480
is information technology

281
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,920
are clearly a hugely transformative

282
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,040
force

283
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
and

284
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,880
history tells us that technological

285
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,399
process

286
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,680
always outpaces social progress so the

287
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,399
kind of conclusion that i drew from this

288
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,600
and

289
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,399
i think that in in fact that is what ocw

290
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,079
represents is that what began to emerge

291
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,519
at least for a period

292
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,000
was a way in which relatively stable and

293
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,440
indeed conservative institutions like

294
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,720
universities

295
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,240
can develop enormous synergies through

296
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,279
the use of ever expanding technological

297
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
tools

298
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,240
so you can at once be

299
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,000
conservative and then in very new ways

300
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,600
evolving and innovating very rapidly

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,880
so add to all this the fact that mit's

302
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,640
ocw

303
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,920
combines the educational quality

304
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,240
and pedagogical approach and ways of

305
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,920
organizing knowledge of a great

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
university

307
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,000
with

308
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,800
the democratizing and empowering forces

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,760
of the internet and the world wide web

310
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,079
in this

311
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,800
increasingly interconnected world that

312
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,279
we just have heard so much about

313
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,200
but of course there is much more than

314
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,519
just mit's educational content going up

315
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
on the web everywhere for everybody for

316
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,079
free

317
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,279
there was a whole movement which

318
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,279
actually preceded it starting with uh

319
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,800
building vast

320
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,120
digital archives of scholarly materials

321
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,959
starting with things like jstor and art

322
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
store and on and on

323
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,800
there is open digital publication that

324
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,560
has developed things like the public

325
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,279
library of science

326
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,680
there's open academic software platforms

327
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,120
and pedagogy like sakai

328
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,440
and all kinds of other open content

329
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,959
initiatives around the country and

330
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,959
around the world

331
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,120
and i want to particularly mention

332
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,279
quickly something that we really haven't

333
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,240
talked much about today

334
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,760
which is the promise of web lab which

335
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,560
again was started here by mit faculty

336
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,279
particularly colleague jesus del alamo

337
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,320
which already although in an embryonic

338
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,800
way it's real is allowing young people

339
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,079
in say sub-saharan africa to sit around

340
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,160
in front of a laptop and in fact control

341
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,360
real experiments for educational

342
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
purposes

343
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,079
using equipment that may be an industry

344
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,880
maybe at mit maybe at stanford what have

345
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,680
you

346
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,639
so there's a whole lot more out there

347
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,120
and also if we step back there's a huge

348
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,200
number of driving forces that are kind

349
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
of pushing and shoving and shaping all

350
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,920
this or at least creating the

351
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,839
opportunities

352
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,720
one is the connectivity

353
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,760
that worldwide connectivity that tom has

354
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,480
so eloquently explained to us

355
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,200
and second is in fact globalization

356
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,720
itself this new world in which we must

357
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,279
compete and cooperate simultaneously in

358
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,279
all kinds of different ways across

359
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,959
traditional boundaries

360
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,959
and third and all of you travel like i'm

361
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,959
fortunate to be able to do

362
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,120
the rest of the world whether we know it

363
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,440
or not in this country the rest of the

364
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,560
world is really tuning in to the

365
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,720
increasing importance of education they

366
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,040
really are understanding that if the

367
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,680
young people aren't educated they're not

368
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,279
going to be able to play in this

369
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,360
evolving world

370
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,399
so what all of this leads to is what i

371
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,480
like to call the meta university

372
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
the meta university something i may

373
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,320
return to in a minute

374
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,000
is really a new

375
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,560
digital substrate or infrastructure of

376
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,519
all this content all these platforms all

377
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,639
this connectivity that teachers learners

378
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,720
and institutions worldwide can build

379
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,480
their own education for their own

380
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,399
purposes shape to their own context upon

381
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,040
so on to the future

382
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,600
first let's start with the pragmatics

383
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,199
how the future plays out not just for

384
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,680
mit ocw but for the entire open

385
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,760
course and open content movement is

386
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,639
going to depend on how well and how

387
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,519
creatively we meet at least four

388
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,880
barriers or obstacles and they really

389
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,760
are obvious

390
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,760
one is intellectual property can we

391
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,519
really pick up and run with creative

392
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,480
commons and so forth and have the

393
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,240
commitment to work with what we have to

394
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,680
work to enable us to have this openness

395
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,079
in an age of ownership of property

396
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,040
second is quality control

397
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,279
the web by definition is the wild west

398
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,360
of information and

399
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,399
if people are going to be serious

400
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,040
learners

401
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,600
somehow things like the imprimatur of

402
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,680
great universities like this are going

403
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
to be very important

404
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,240
third is of course how do you meet the

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,959
costs i sometimes give talks about

406
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,600
things like ocw and i have a slide that

407
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,360
say what's the business model and then i

408
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,160
say next slide please and we go on to

409
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,480
the next topic because we are providing

410
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,880
a free good somebody ultimately has to

411
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,600
see the value and pay for it in this

412
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,720
open sharing way will we do that by

413
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,160
partnering are there new funding models

414
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,320
susan and the whole team here are

415
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,480
thinking very hard about these issues

416
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,800
going forward and of course finally is

417
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,040
bandwidth we're all used to having lots

418
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,560
of connectivity and bandwidth but

419
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,399
despite the flattening of the world

420
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,639
there's still plenty of places

421
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,279
who don't have it in the

422
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,920
extent that it is needed and so new

423
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,959
delivery mechanisms like the creative

424
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,519
use of ipods and so forth and so on has

425
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,240
to be a big player going forward

426
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,399
so what's the conclusion i draw about

427
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,680
draw from all this

428
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
first of all

429
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,800
in addition to having a great idea that

430
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,040
came from this extraordinary faculty

431
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,680
committee most of the members of which

432
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,399
you met just a few moments ago

433
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,600
mit ocw had first mover advantage

434
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,040
first mover advantage coupled with

435
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,680
an institutional quality level and a

436
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,079
literally iconic recognition factor

437
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,160
around the world combining those two

438
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,199
things allowed us i believe to move

439
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,920
forward

440
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,079
and also and keep this in mind as we try

441
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,079
to think through the the future and

442
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,320
decide what waiting function to put on

443
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,120
all the things john's going to tell us

444
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,639
we had what was fundamentally

445
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,440
a very simple accessible product

446
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,519
and

447
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,759
wrestling with that tension about what's

448
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,839
innovative new and different and what is

449
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,919
really easy to put in people's hands and

450
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,199
use is i think a lot of what we have to

451
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
think forward in the whole movement

452
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,319
going forward

453
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,280
ocw here and elsewhere is going to have

454
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,919
to thrive based on i think at least four

455
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,280
things one excellent standards of

456
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,400
quality and as i say the sort of quality

457
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,799
control and recognition factors

458
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,600
scale and comprehensiveness were what

459
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,600
was

460
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,360
particularly unique about open

461
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
courseware there was nothing new about

462
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,000
the idea of putting some material on the

463
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,640
web it was the scale and institutional

464
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
comprehensiveness that gave it its

465
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,919
uniqueness and still gives it uniqueness

466
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
today

467
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,799
it will thrive depending on our ability

468
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,160
and will to continue to define the

469
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,760
cutting edge

470
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,760
and in fact to innovate fast and well

471
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,559
which is what of course has to go on

472
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,360
everywhere in this globalized world

473
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,919
and finally i would put out that it will

474
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,799
thrive depending on how we address the

475
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,039
widening uses because we've talked about

476
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,720
this as this wonderful global free good

477
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,280
which is something i passionately

478
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,880
believe in but it's having enormous

479
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,520
impact inside mit

480
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,320
students and faculty members using it as

481
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,559
kind of a time clutch to shift forward

482
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,960
to see how fundamentals are going to be

483
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,039
applied in later courses or to look from

484
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,000
a course backward to refresh and so

485
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,280
forth

486
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
uh what can we do in the daunting tasks

487
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,919
facing this nation and and others in

488
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
secondary education

489
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,440
and lifelong learning something that has

490
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,280
just got to be a reality in any advanced

491
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,360
society today

492
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,720
and i believe that mit ocw must by

493
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,080
definition thrive on globalization we

494
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,720
must embrace openness and the creation

495
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,880
of electronic-based learning communities

496
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
we must continue to define the cutting

497
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
edge

498
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,520
while remaining

499
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,559
widely globally accessible in what we do

500
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,200
and above all we will thrive if and only

501
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,720
if we continue as you have done so

502
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,320
marvelously really standing tall for the

503
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,280
basic principle

504
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,600
of sharing and empowerment

505
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,280
i was going to read you two paragraphs

506
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,120
from a book i wrote on the meta

507
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,000
university but i'm going to skip that so

508
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,679
we can go on and hear from sam what is

509
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,480
really happening beyond the boundaries

510
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,480
of cambridge thank you

511
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,440
thank you

512
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,919
thank you

513
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,840
i'd like to comment on

514
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,840
ocw from the viewpoint of india

515
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,200
india is a country in

516
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,679
hurry

517
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,799
growing at the rate of nine percent

518
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,080
1.1 billion people

519
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,400
550 million below

520
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,280
age of 25

521
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,200
expanding everywhere

522
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,760
and demanding

523
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,799
low-cost solutions

524
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,799
just to give you an idea

525
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,480
when i entered telecom scene

526
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,440
in 80s

527
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,840
we had about 2 million telephones

528
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,960
for the entire country of 750 million

529
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,159
people

530
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,919
then

531
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,919
today we have

532
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,159
or we are adding

533
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,480
seven to eight million cell phones every

534
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,480
month

535
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,280
the cost structure is such

536
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,919
that while world is looking at 11

537
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,640
aarpu average revenue per user

538
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,559
india can survive and flourish

539
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
with five dollar arpu

540
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,600
so today our main need is

541
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,520
speed

542
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,440
scale

543
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,840
and low cost

544
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
models

545
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,000
in this process of development we

546
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,520
recognize we have serious skill

547
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,159
shortages

548
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,360
we don't have enough engineers

549
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,960
scientists

550
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,840
teachers

551
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,240
including truck drivers

552
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,400
today india needs 500

553
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:20,000
000 trained truck drivers

554
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
a lot of crazy people driving around

555
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,360
without license

556
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,679
as a result of this

557
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,960
prime minister of india decided to set

558
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,280
up a national knowledge commission

559
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,679
a couple of years ago

560
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,919
we have seven members in the commission

561
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
we meet once every two months for three

562
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
days

563
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,960
and we look at five areas

564
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,960
of knowledge

565
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,640
access to knowledge

566
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,440
to us that means

567
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,360
literacy languages translations

568
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,080
libraries networks portals reservations

569
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,559
affirmative action programs

570
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,799
then we look at knowledge concepts

571
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,320
primary education secondary education

572
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,799
distance learning

573
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,679
open courseware

574
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,679
higher education

575
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,400
vocational education so and so forth

576
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,320
we also look at

577
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,640
creation of knowledge science and

578
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,000
technology patents copyright trademark

579
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,159
entrepreneurship

580
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,919
innovations

581
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
application of knowledge

582
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,760
for

583
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,760
agricultural health and small and medium

584
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,120
scale industries

585
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,120
and finally e-governance

586
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,200
in education we are focused on three key

587
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
challenges

588
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,720
expansion

589
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
we don't have enough schools enough

590
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,520
teachers enough

591
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,240
professors

592
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,240
at all levels

593
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,799
second excellence

594
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,760
leaving aside top tier of maybe

595
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,520
five percent of universities iit's iims

596
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,240
and some other universities

597
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,080
quality of education at university level

598
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,200
is very poor

599
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,480
and third

600
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,320
equity

601
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,720
we have to make sure

602
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,480
that poorest of the poor can

603
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,600
have the opportunity

604
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,600
to go to the best schools

605
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,320
as a result of all these discussions in

606
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,320
the last two years government of india

607
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,240
has decided to quadruple

608
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,120
investments in education

609
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,720
in the next five years

610
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,039
according to eleventh plan indian

611
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,320
government would be spending 65 billion

612
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,480
dollars

613
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,120
in education

614
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,720
we are building 30 new major national

615
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,039
universities

616
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,679
4 000 colleges

617
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,760
providing additional meals

618
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,679
to 60 million children mid-day meal

619
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,159
program

620
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,840
we want to grow from 320 universities to

621
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,799
1500

622
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,320
in next five years how do we do all of

623
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,080
these things

624
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,159
we are beginning to ask questions that

625
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,000
we have never asked before

626
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,840
questions like

627
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,840
do you really need classroom to learn

628
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,799
today when you think of education you

629
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,360
think of duster blackbird chalk

630
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,200
teacher textbook exam grades

631
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,799
so and so forth

632
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,080
so that's one fundamental question we

633
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,120
are asking

634
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,600
second

635
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,600
what's the role of the teacher

636
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,440
traditionally teacher has been busy

637
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:26,320
creating content and delivering content

638
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,039
can i take that away from teacher

639
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,000
and have content created somewhere else

640
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,919
and delivered through electronic media

641
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
so future teacher would be more of a

642
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,200
mentor

643
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,520
third

644
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,760
what would the university of 2050 look

645
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,760
like

646
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
do you think they would

647
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,799
have a campus like this

648
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,320
today when we are building university

649
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,840
automatically we are going off and

650
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,840
acquiring 500 acre land

651
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,559
creating huge amount of buildings

652
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
and people like me are saying look this

653
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,279
is not feasible we just don't have

654
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,600
enough resources in spite of 65 billion

655
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,720
dollars

656
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
to one

657
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,120
train teachers

658
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,440
and to create infrastructure

659
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,760
and that's where i believe ocw kind of

660
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,760
an experiment

661
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,159
gives some hope

662
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,640
we don't know how it's going to unfold

663
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,880
we had a group on ocw

664
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,679
in india

665
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
we had one of your mit

666
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,720
representative on the

667
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
group

668
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
vijay

669
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,600
we spent about six nine months studying

670
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,520
the whole subject

671
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,360
and we have submitted recommendations to

672
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,520
the prime minister

673
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,000
our normal process is we have a working

674
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,360
group set up on a subject

675
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,559
and we deal with about 50 different

676
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
subjects

677
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,320
like say

678
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,080
national knowledge network

679
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,600
we would have about 30 people working on

680
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,760
national knowledge network spend nine

681
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,279
months come back with a white paper

682
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,640
which we would debate at the national

683
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,320
knowledge commission

684
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,320
and the output would be a three-page

685
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,840
letter from me to the prime minister

686
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,200
saying we suggest following things

687
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,640
for the government

688
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
we are planning to build a knowledge

689
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,200
network to connect 5000 locations with

690
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,120
one gigabit

691
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,360
broadband connectivity

692
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,840
to connect all our universities

693
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,520
major libraries r d institutions

694
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,279
agricultural research and health

695
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,559
research

696
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,240
ocw becomes an important part

697
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,760
of our effort

698
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,279
we are still learning

699
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,200
we are not very clear

700
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,600
as to where we are headed

701
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,080
but i see a lot of hope

702
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,600
and i hope we can work with mit to learn

703
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,919
more about this

704
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,360
experiment some more

705
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,520
and get some help

706
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,520
thank you

707
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,120
i want to do something slightly

708
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,880
different

709
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,919
but building on everything we've heard

710
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,840
today and

711
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,760
tom also pulling off some of the things

712
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,559
you were saying

713
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,279
i'm really struck um

714
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,279
you know i spent some time in india and

715
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,039
wrote a helped write a report called

716
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,120
minds on fire

717
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,600
the interesting question

718
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,120
how do we get minds on fire is not our

719
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,039
real challenge the challenge of

720
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,840
imagination inspiration and intuition

721
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,360
i think those triads are very powerful

722
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,159
notion

723
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,200
i thought it was strange to come to mit

724
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,640
to talk about inspiration imagination

725
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,640
and so on because every time i come here

726
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,320
i walk across campus

727
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,399
i run into students

728
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,720
i gotta tell you the students on this

729
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,440
campus have more fire in the belly

730
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,440
mine's on fire than any place i know of

731
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
in the world um

732
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,080
i'm not going to comment about the

733
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,080
faculty i'm talking about the students

734
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,039
i don't meet the faculty very often but

735
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,320
the students you meet in the bars and

736
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,039
things like this

737
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,799
and it's really interesting and

738
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,120
you step back a moment

739
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,200
you might even say back to the future

740
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,279
and you go back to the origins of most

741
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,880
of our physical sciences

742
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,399
and you recognize that science grew out

743
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,960
of tinkering

744
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,480
we were tinkerers and we were tinkerers

745
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,399
and we were bloggers

746
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,080
those bloggers happen to be formed

747
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,200
called letters into royal society of

748
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,200
letters

749
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,399
but that's how science got off the

750
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,399
ground to a very large extent

751
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,440
i think tom if you go back to your

752
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,480
platform

753
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,240
we're now beginning to enter a new world

754
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,960
a new flat kind of world with a new kind

755
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,120
of platform a platform fundamentally

756
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
empowering tinkerers

757
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,360
all kinds of tinkerers

758
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,360
some might call them mashups i might

759
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,520
call them remix some might call them

760
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,080
actually engaging in tinkering in the

761
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,679
old style tinkering that built our

762
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,080
automotive industry i might point out in

763
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,120
the 1900s and so on and so forth

764
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,120
tinkering building real stuff as well

765
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,159
i'm really struck let's take some

766
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,039
examples think about open source

767
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,440
we may actually be enculturating

768
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,279
maybe a million students not into the

769
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,080
theory of computer science but the

770
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,399
practices of certain communities of

771
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,240
computer science communities of practice

772
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,679
different open source communities linux

773
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,240
communities different than the apache

774
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,840
community it's different than red hat

775
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,760
each of these communities have their own

776
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,240
kind of distinctness distinctiveness

777
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,720
sensibilities and so on but you have the

778
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,279
passion to join those and enjoying those

779
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,360
you pick up their practices their ways

780
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,520
of looking at the world

781
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,919
let's go on that's so obvious but it is

782
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,399
pretty pervasive around the world

783
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,080
let's talk about astronomy

784
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,279
think about for the moment the fox

785
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,360
telescope

786
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,399
two beautiful telescopes one i know well

787
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,880
in maui

788
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,720
i'm actually paid for by by the english

789
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,720
government actually by a man named folks

790
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,760
and this is a completely robotically

791
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
driven

792
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,360
telescope

793
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,000
students all over england

794
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,960
australia and now opened up through ocw

795
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,960
a limited amount can actually program up

796
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,360
interesting experiments to run on this

797
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,279
telescope there's only one catch

798
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,440
the catch is you got to make it open

799
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,919
source that's to say that you have to

800
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,679
put whatever you take up on the net and

801
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,840
you have to give your interpretations to

802
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,919
that and other people from the community

803
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,240
including professionals

804
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,039
are there to comment on what you do with

805
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,600
that

806
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,360
a new kind of learning community between

807
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,440
i'm going to come back to it amateurs

808
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,919
and professionals is starting to emerge

809
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,440
here just naturally in the white space

810
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
so to speak

811
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,840
what do we have here in boston

812
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,240
something called the micro observatory a

813
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,200
micro observatory up the street

814
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,600
has either two or three telescopes

815
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,799
robotic telescopes fairly simple

816
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,720
telescopes

817
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,880
interestingly every night this week

818
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,679
before i got on the airplane last night

819
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,440
i have grabbed time on those telescopes

820
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,600
and made certain measurements that get

821
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,279
delivered to me in the morning to go

822
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,440
over and then i can put it through my

823
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,480
own digital signal processing algorithms

824
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,880
because they give it to me in the right

825
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,519
kind of format to actually be able to do

826
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,600
even more processing on that

827
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,840
now let's think about

828
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,000
the world of insects

829
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,919
by the way today's kids aren't

830
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,559
necessarily turned on by digital chips

831
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,799
like we were they are turned on by how

832
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,120
bugs work how the animal world works now

833
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,039
let's think about bug scope bug scope is

834
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,399
a fairly serious electron scanning

835
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,039
microscope again robotically controlled

836
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,679
and put on the net kids from all over

837
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,760
can submit samples they get prepared

838
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,679
and actually high school students from

839
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,159
around the world can use that as a

840
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,960
remote instrument to explore things

841
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,519
kids get turned on by this kind of

842
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,360
tinkering they can actually as i did by

843
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,640
mistake two nights ago drastically

844
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,000
overexposed things on one of your

845
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,159
telescopes here

846
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,640
you learn by failure you learn by

847
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,120
tinkering again now think about going

848
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,760
back to the topic that tom ended with

849
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,600
the whole issue of global climate change

850
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,760
and what are we doing both to the water

851
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,640
and to the climate think what global

852
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,880
labs does in terms of empowering the

853
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,039
world's kids to go out and take

854
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
measurements around the world of water

855
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,279
for example and then compile that data

856
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,120
together run analyses off it and so on

857
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,760
and so forth and of course what do you

858
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,519
have here when i first got this idea is

859
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,840
ilab or

860
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,039
is it now called weblab

861
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,840
okay

862
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,519
okay i only knew it as ilab uh in terms

863
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,600
of a very interesting set of heat

864
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,919
exchangers that i can actually run

865
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,080
remote experiments this way so i just

866
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,399
want to call it our attention that

867
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,399
although ocw in the first phase looked a

868
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,320
lot at content

869
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,559
maybe the next stage is to also look at

870
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,399
activities and what are the activities

871
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,720
you do around this content having to do

872
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,320
with tools having to do with instruments

873
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,440
because we can virtually put any

874
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,200
instrument we want today on the web

875
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,960
and most schools can't afford the three

876
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,799
or four million dollars for the fancy

877
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,799
electron scanning microscope but the

878
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,240
nation can afford that

879
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,320
it can be put on the terror grid if

880
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,600
nothing else and so i think we have an

881
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,760
ability to bring back tinkering

882
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,559
the tinkering that actually is the basis

883
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,320
of our intuition because it is one thing

884
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,240
to be inspired but if you're inspired

885
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,799
without intuition

886
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,440
then that's only so good but most of us

887
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,200
get our intuition from playing around

888
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,440
with stuff

889
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,440
and that stuff can be done remotely and

890
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,279
by the way it can also be done in terms

891
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,880
of things like tech shop in terms of

892
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,480
machine control

893
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,799
computer controlled machining tools

894
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,880
building real things again like neil

895
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,039
gershenfeld has led here in the in the

896
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,640
media lab so i really think that we're

897
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,440
beginning to build another kind of

898
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,120
platform tom a platform that brings all

899
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,919
the kind of content we're talking

900
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,720
activities we're talking but now tools

901
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,440
many many tools into kind of an informal

902
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,919
learning context where tinkering can

903
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,560
come back because i really think content

904
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,760
plus tinkering with real tools really

905
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,560
does

906
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,720
lay the foundation for a way to kind of

907
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,359
get gut understanding for things and

908
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,960
reignite passion not just on mit

909
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,119
students which you have no problem with

910
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,359
here but for the rest of this country

911
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,520
which we do have a problem with thank

912
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,520
you

913
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,879
well we'd like to hear from some of you

914
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,079
they're microphones being around they're

915
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,079
supposed to be microphones going on

916
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,960
so we'd like to hear some of your

917
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,320
visions and

918
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,560
some of what you think and if you don't

919
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,040
volunteer we will call on you i'm a

920
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,040
professor

921
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,400
up there here

922
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,640
i'd like to

923
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,240
ask you to look again at this notion of

924
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,160
tinkering

925
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,480
because i remember

926
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,320
talking to colleagues of mine in

927
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,200
engineering saying that what's wrong is

928
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,280
that

929
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,359
the devices that are now available you

930
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,359
can't tinker with anymore

931
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,000
so how can you tinkle tinker with an

932
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,599
ipod those are the engineers who grew up

933
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
taking

934
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,920
watches apart

935
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,440
so tinkering i think is not the right

936
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,800
word or at least you have to rethink

937
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,640
what you mean by tinkering because

938
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,880
you're tinkering with things that are

939
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,040
really quite abstract now

940
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,280
and that seems to me to be in a kind of

941
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,040
a collision course with what

942
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,920
you said sir

943
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,440
about

944
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,839
you need 500 000 truck drivers

945
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,440
those are really two different worlds

946
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,280
the world of the truck driver and the

947
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,359
guy who's going to uh

948
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,119
tinker in your sense

949
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,800
and what worries me is how you're going

950
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,000
to uh

951
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,880
how are you going to

952
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,720
mash those worlds together are you for

953
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,760
example going to think well the way to

954
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,079
do it

955
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,960
might be to take up the technology of

956
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,200
driverless cars that we're doing here so

957
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,079
that you can free up those 500 000 truck

958
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,839
drivers to tinker the way

959
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,280
a user wanted to do it

960
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,839
so those were just some of the thoughts

961
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,839
that i had

962
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,720
the idea is not to buy 500 000 trucks to

963
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,240
train truck drivers

964
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,480
but the idea is to get some technology

965
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,760
to help in the training of 500 000 truck

966
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,040
drivers otherwise you will never do it

967
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,960
i think technology is the hope

968
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,119
to meet the kind of scale we are talking

969
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,680
about what i was concerned is

970
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,160
don't you aren't the 500 000 truck

971
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,079
drivers

972
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,040
sort of excluded from the tinkering

973
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
world

974
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,320
maybe that's okay

975
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,720
i don't think everybody i don't think

976
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,960
everybody would be capable of tinkering

977
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,440
i don't expect everybody to be tinkering

978
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,960
but if some people tinker enough to come

979
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
up with something interesting for truck

980
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,000
driver

981
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,760
that's more interesting

982
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,079
that's how i look at it

983
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,599
yeah yeah i i have kind of mixed kind of

984
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,800
i mean i understand exactly where you're

985
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,280
coming from and in fact um

986
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
you know what really struck me is that

987
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,040
most of us grew up as tinkerers till

988
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,440
about 1980. and then tinkerine

989
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,040
disappeared um and i in my fancy

990
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
terminology i said everything became

991
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,200
cognitively impenetrable means i

992
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,200
couldn't grok it

993
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,880
and what hit me is about 1995

994
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,000
i suddenly discovered tinkering was

995
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,280
coming back

996
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,680
and was coming back by the way in media

997
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,760
and kids were doing incredible remixes

998
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,000
mashups and so on and so forth and

999
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,920
starting from that platform you know

1000
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,760
that kind of tinkering really did take

1001
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,440
off and just look at youtube and a lot

1002
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,760
of that actually comes from all kinds of

1003
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,079
tinkering with content with media modes

1004
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,680
of expression and so on so that i saw is

1005
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,440
the beginning platform and then i

1006
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,000
started realizing more and more of these

1007
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,720
tools are now being made robotic

1008
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,640
robotically capable that actually if you

1009
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,560
join the community

1010
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,680
the community actually as a set of pure

1011
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,240
learners actually is a pretty

1012
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,440
interesting scaffolding structure and so

1013
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,200
it's kind of looking at the notion of

1014
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,119
the long tail in terms of these very

1015
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,040
niche communities that you may want to

1016
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,119
be passionately kind of joining so i

1017
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,599
mean i think the story i agree has

1018
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,960
gotten more complicated and i was very

1019
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,839
happy to see

1020
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,280
um a movement called make it's more on

1021
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,040
the west coast and the east coast

1022
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,440
although i think it's propagating over

1023
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,000
here too where now you're finding in

1024
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,320
essence community libraries

1025
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,079
that are now setting themselves up the

1026
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,599
particular thing called tech shop in

1027
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,640
menlo park where basically you can get

1028
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,520
as a student now or myself as an ancient

1029
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,079
can get access to almost any kind of

1030
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,599
mechanical device to kind of do

1031
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,599
you know machine controlled

1032
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,920
computer-controlled lathing and building

1033
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,440
stuff with the physical stuff and so i

1034
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,720
actually think that we're finding new

1035
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,560
ways to fill that gap but no we're not

1036
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,280
going to be opening chips and watching

1037
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,960
how they work um i agree with you but i

1038
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,160
think that somehow tinkering is going to

1039
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,040
be happening at a higher level now your

1040
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,119
real point is are we just talking about

1041
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,960
the abstract tinkering with ideas of

1042
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,280
course is what you do in good share of

1043
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,000
science but i think if you look at the

1044
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,240
remix game in media you're really

1045
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,079
thinking about emotion you're thinking

1046
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,480
about communication you're thinking

1047
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,320
about other things that underlie how do

1048
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,320
you communicate and capture people's

1049
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,000
attention and i think that's going to be

1050
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,560
a new kind of tinkering that i think is

1051
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,079
going to be critical at all stages of

1052
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,079
the kinds of economy we're talking about

1053
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,720
hello

1054
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,200
i was wanting to draw the attention back

1055
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,640
to teaching and learning

1056
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,280
and propose to

1057
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,800
propose to the panel a question

1058
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,920
it seems to me

1059
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,119
that most of us in the room

1060
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,680
have

1061
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,319
grown up in a world in which the

1062
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,839
information and knowledge that we

1063
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,319
consumed or learned or acted with

1064
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,839
was structured say by the dewey decimal

1065
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,200
system or by

1066
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,319
traditional classroom

1067
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,920
based disciplinary categories

1068
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:48,960
and as i see a new generation coming up

1069
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,160
with google searches and so forth

1070
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,400
and as i look at my son who is a senior

1071
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,800
in university

1072
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,240
doing papers and being able to put

1073
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,720
things together in the way that i would

1074
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,560
never have been able even to imagine

1075
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,880
when i was a student

1076
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,280
i'm just wondering if

1077
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,119
the whole

1078
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,960
new technologies

1079
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,200
isn't rewiring

1080
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,920
the brains of our children

1081
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,800
in such ways that we can't

1082
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,359
even

1083
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,280
imagine or catch up with as we think

1084
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,599
about the future of

1085
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,400
teaching and learning i'm wondering if

1086
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,440
the

1087
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,560
actual

1088
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,280
structure

1089
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,760
and

1090
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,839
access to human knowledge isn't being so

1091
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,040
restructured that we now have

1092
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,560
different i hate to use the word

1093
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,119
paradigms

1094
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,680
to to imagine as we think about the

1095
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,200
future of of learning and education i'm

1096
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,800
wondering if the panel

1097
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,040
had any of the panel have thought about

1098
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,839
that or considered it as we think about

1099
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,839
the future

1100
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,680
yeah we don't have the answers but we

1101
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,760
have lots of questions

1102
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,920
one question is why does it take four

1103
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,720
years to get a bs in something who came

1104
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,720
up with that idea

1105
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,720
is that idea valid today

1106
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,960
i don't know

1107
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,160
why does it take so many courses to get

1108
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,040
a masters

1109
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,040
can we change that

1110
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,920
i do agree

1111
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,800
that all of the paradigms of the past

1112
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,720
needs to be questioned

1113
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,119
role of teacher role of classroom

1114
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,720
content

1115
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,359
the kind of material we teach is it

1116
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,160
relevant today i know this kind of stuff

1117
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,800
we teach in india today in many cases is

1118
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,800
absolutely irrelevant

1119
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,680
i don't care about the history of

1120
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,280
british raj in india anymore

1121
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,440
so i don't need to learn about george v

1122
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,680
it's not relevant to me but we still

1123
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,680
teach

1124
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,319
so i do agree that this is the time to

1125
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,319
question

1126
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,520
i think the answer to your question is

1127
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,160
yes

1128
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,119
but what we do about it i have no idea i

1129
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,560
think one

1130
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,319
question i only want to disagree with

1131
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,079
you one thing somebody has to be

1132
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,319
learning about and thinking about george

1133
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,200
the fifth sure we have to don't teach me

1134
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,480
as a engineering student perhaps

1135
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,000
okay

1136
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,359
and it's okay it's your privilege if you

1137
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,760
want to learn learn

1138
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,160
but don't force me into it i i think the

1139
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,560
one point i do want to make to this is

1140
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,400
really uh embedded in something that

1141
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,079
john select brown said

1142
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,599
and that's one of the really exciting

1143
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,680
things that's happening today whether

1144
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,560
it's tinkering-based or not

1145
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,960
are the increase of learning communities

1146
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,560
where you have older people who may have

1147
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,800
some wisdom but not a clue what's

1148
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,359
actually going on and you have young

1149
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,520
people who do think in absolutely

1150
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,560
different ways and i think this

1151
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,200
continual mixing beyond the formal based

1152
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,400
learning is really exciting and i don't

1153
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,280
know where it's going to lead but i

1154
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,040
think it's going to lead in a good

1155
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,880
direction but unfortunately people who

1156
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,440
are planning education are all in 60s

1157
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,599
no i agree yeah but you know chuck

1158
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,760
your observation is what really sets the

1159
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,680
stage for a culture of learning

1160
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,440
i mean because now that really if you

1161
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,040
can get these types of communities to

1162
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,640
self-form and interact you know

1163
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,960
productively as i think they are

1164
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,040
happening um that is probably the single

1165
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,800
best way to you know to crack the

1166
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,119
original problem of lifelong learning

1167
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,280
that you know that ocw started out with

1168
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,319
but two brief comments

1169
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,800
you know one thing that's really

1170
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,800
happening um and you guys know it here

1171
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,520
tremendously well um is the role of

1172
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,760
visualization i mean many kids today are

1173
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,280
much more are really in fact most of us

1174
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,880
in this room are probably much more

1175
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,440
visual than we want to kind of really

1176
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,720
understand our ability to do incredible

1177
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,720
visualizations of very complex systems

1178
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,880
really provide you kind of a gut

1179
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,040
intuition again of something that is

1180
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,119
very hard to capture just by looking at

1181
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,040
partial differential equations i think

1182
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,560
the second thing is we've got to pay a

1183
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,720
little bit attention to reading

1184
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,240
practices because the reading practices

1185
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
are going to be changing let me just

1186
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,319
look at wikipedia which was talked about

1187
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,319
earlier

1188
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,160
the catches

1189
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,400
when you ask the quality of stuff on

1190
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,480
media wikipedia and compare it to

1191
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,319
britannica that's not necessarily a

1192
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,880
well-formed question

1193
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,960
because the reading practices of a

1194
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,480
skilled person in britannica are

1195
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,800
completely different than the reading

1196
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,800
practices of a skilled person in

1197
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,800
wikipedia because if you know how to

1198
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,960
read wikipedia you know how to go to the

1199
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,200
edit page you know how to see what are

1200
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,800
the edits what are the rollbacks so you

1201
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,079
know how to find out what's being

1202
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,640
contested

1203
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,400
so now you have a window into the con

1204
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,800
what is conte what is the contested

1205
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,720
knowledge part of that definition which

1206
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,640
gives you a tremendous insight which you

1207
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,119
almost never see because we have opened

1208
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,280
up that completely so now you see what

1209
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,359
is still under negotiation or being

1210
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,280
contested

1211
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,880
that is a new practice

1212
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,560
so i think the the issue that you

1213
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,240
brought up really is

1214
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,640
it's kind of the the answer to the

1215
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,160
question i asked is what can we imagine

1216
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,400
coming after

1217
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,920
education 1.0

1218
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,839
so those of us who think about the world

1219
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,319
wide web and how it's put together in a

1220
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,040
in a technical architectural way

1221
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,839
the web is designed in a very particular

1222
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,079
way so that every piece of it can link

1223
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,160
to every other piece of it it sounds a

1224
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,079
little trivial now but to say that in

1225
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,480
1992 would have been a

1226
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,960
revelation and what's happening now is

1227
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,000
we have the ability to take knowledge

1228
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,319
and organize it so that every piece of

1229
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,880
it can link to every other piece of it

1230
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,560
on a very fine grained scale

1231
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,000
that brings up the possibility of the

1232
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,720
kinds of things that that you've been

1233
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,200
talking about about sort of niche you

1234
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,119
know personalized learning experiences

1235
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,400
based on putting things together but at

1236
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,880
the same time

1237
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,359
it raises this issue about what's

1238
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,200
quality what's an education if it's sort

1239
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,200
of random putting together we don't know

1240
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,560
how to how to judge that how to assess

1241
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,599
it and i think that's one of the real

1242
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,440
challenges

1243
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,720
that as we look ahead from what this

1244
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,440
revolution is ringing that we're going

1245
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,760
to have to face

1246
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,760
larry

1247
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,800
a proposition to the to the group and

1248
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,359
let you react to it

1249
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,800
um we live in a world because of all the

1250
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,040
changes that have already been noted by

1251
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,359
the various speakers including tom

1252
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,839
in which knowledge has been democratized

1253
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,000
um and access to it

1254
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,520
has been greatly increased and we've

1255
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,720
greatly reduced

1256
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,880
the cost of gaining access to knowledge

1257
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,079
to learning and to the tools of

1258
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,000
knowledge and learning

1259
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,000
colleges and universities

1260
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
convey knowledge they teach that's one

1261
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,520
function that we we perform but the

1262
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,880
other thing which we do is that we

1263
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,760
certify

1264
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,400
we we send signals to the world that in

1265
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,760
fact in fact people have acquired it and

1266
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,520
the proposition that i'd like you to

1267
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,680
react to is that

1268
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,000
in a world in which knowledge is

1269
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,240
becoming more diffuse and access to it

1270
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,920
is becoming much easier

1271
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,319
that ironically the value of the signals

1272
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,960
that are being provided by institutions

1273
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,400
like this one are

1274
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,760
ever more

1275
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,319
valuable

1276
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,800
and so we have more and more people

1277
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,200
in fact trying to gain access to the

1278
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,160
signal that is represented by having

1279
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,440
studied at an institution like this when

1280
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,760
in fact

1281
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,680
the knowledge is is that much more

1282
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,240
available and diffuse that's a

1283
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,240
proposition

1284
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:37,280
no

1285
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,280
mr president

1286
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,760
the

1287
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,880
larry i'm not sure i grasped totally

1288
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,359
what what you wanted to say

1289
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,040
if if we go back

1290
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,119
i agree that

1291
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,480
what's very exciting today what we've

1292
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,559
all said many different ways is with the

1293
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,079
amount of information which by the way

1294
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,000
may or may not be knowledge but at least

1295
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,200
the amount of information that is out

1296
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,880
there

1297
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,200
the game is putting it together in the

1298
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,359
most interesting creative and in some

1299
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,720
cases useful ways

1300
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:16,559
and that our

1301
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,480
traditional roles in universities of

1302
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,079
certifying that

1303
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,160
yes this young woman knows the

1304
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,000
fundamentals of the following profession

1305
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,440
and so forth

1306
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,480
the meaning of that

1307
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,680
may be

1308
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:33,440
maybe in question but i i'm not sure it

1309
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,559
is if you think of it as only one stage

1310
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,520
along a life of learning and working

1311
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,119
but then the fact that uh that we

1312
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,720
amplify

1313
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,480
signals

1314
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,200
as you put it i think is very important

1315
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,200
one of the things i tried to say uh a

1316
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,200
little earlier today

1317
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,640
that what i thought was really important

1318
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,680
about

1319
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,520
about ocw was that it put out there the

1320
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,680
thoughts of our faculty about how

1321
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,880
knowledge should be organized

1322
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,760
and what our fundamental pedagogy

1323
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,520
was

1324
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,920
and i think that's probably more

1325
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,559
important than the details of the

1326
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,480
content but i'm not sure exactly how to

1327
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,079
answer your question about

1328
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,319
what the

1329
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,559
meaning and what it says to us about the

1330
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,000
amplification of these signals really is

1331
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,000
other than that we should be very

1332
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
careful

1333
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,640
so this is more of a comment actually uh

1334
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,720
so we all understand that content needs

1335
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,800
to be engaging if you put it somewhere

1336
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,839
and the two examples that recently came

1337
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,200
from mit are actually how tunes which is

1338
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,359
a comic book

1339
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,400
uh written about how to make stuff and

1340
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,480
then drew andy synthetic biology

1341
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,640
so do you see ocw actually playing a

1342
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,720
much more important role in this type of

1343
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,319
a content creation

1344
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,720
or actually at least promoting it

1345
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,720
further

1346
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,760
i mean i certainly i certainly see that

1347
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,640
it could i mean one of the things that's

1348
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,400
to my mind a little bit absent from ocw

1349
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,000
are more materials that are written by

1350
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,599
mit students

1351
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,920
both of the things you mentioned

1352
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,839
are examples of that

1353
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,599
but i

1354
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,720
also i also think there's this constant

1355
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,160
uh

1356
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,319
tug of war

1357
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,240
between a lot of things that are made by

1358
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,720
a lot of people

1359
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,800
and saying this is the mit curriculum

1360
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,400
put up as a something for the world to

1361
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,559
examine in the world to build on and for

1362
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,559
me this is a this is a real issue going

1363
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,680
forward and how we resolve it

1364
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,960
but

1365
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,400
i guess the other thing i wanted to say

1366
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,800
is

1367
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,319
this is too much about mit and ocw i'd

1368
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,160
like to hear

1369
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:52,480
i warned you i'd i'd call on you i'd

1370
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,760
like to hear dick rowe actually talk a

1371
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,920
little bit about this notion of

1372
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,599
empowerment and how you think about that

1373
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,200
so maybe

1374
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,359
if you give your question and then ask

1375
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,359
to

1376
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,760
again speak having quit

1377
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,400
a subject on ocw

1378
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,079
i suspect that there's a lot of faculty

1379
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,160
around the world

1380
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,520
that would be willing to

1381
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,920
augment

1382
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:22,480
much like wikipedia and the question is

1383
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,520
is there a model that people come up

1384
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,119
with

1385
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,599
for

1386
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,760
somehow

1387
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,599
an in-between model where you where you

1388
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,520
maintain excellence

1389
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,559
and at the same time

1390
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,839
draw on this huge energy from the

1391
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,359
community

1392
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,359
to develop materials

1393
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,520
you know i think

1394
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,000
and

1395
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,359
mike can talk about this at uh uh mike

1396
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,280
smith but

1397
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,960
i mean one of the kind of next stages of

1398
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,400
a lot of this open education resource

1399
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,240
movement has to do with how do you close

1400
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,480
the loop in various ways i mean take a

1401
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:03,040
piece of material you know a course

1402
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,720
remash it uh remix it and mash it up in

1403
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,559
different cultures all over the world

1404
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,559
what an incredible learning opportunity

1405
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,760
that is what are the mind bugs students

1406
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,079
of different cultures have when they

1407
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,480
read your text and so on so how do you

1408
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,319
actually feed all that stuff back

1409
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,800
you know it is a very interesting

1410
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,319
question um then how do you start to let

1411
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,400
other people be able to add material to

1412
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,079
it which is like what connections does

1413
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,559
how do you then try to figure out what

1414
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,400
hold it now i've lost the warrants uh

1415
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,079
and so you know this is a this is kind

1416
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,079
of pandora's box but i think we're going

1417
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,920
to find some very clever types of

1418
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,839
recommendation systems warranting

1419
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,599
systems lenses that you can put over

1420
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,040
this material to see you know which of

1421
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,800
this material has been vetted by whom

1422
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,440
and so on and so forth so i think this

1423
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,520
is

1424
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,200
this is a new kind of a platform i think

1425
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,359
we're just at the very beginning to be

1426
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,400
able to uh understand how to really play

1427
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,960
this out

1428
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,040
just just very quickly on this this is

1429
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,880
why i use this term meta university

1430
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,880
because i think it is a platform it's an

1431
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,200
infrastructure and at least for the

1432
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,800
foreseeable future i think the loop's

1433
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,119
not going to be closed it's going to run

1434
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,240
open loop that's what we're observing

1435
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,960
right now

1436
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,119
and so i when we first got started in

1437
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,680
this my assumption was that it would

1438
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,440
ultimately morph into something like

1439
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,319
more like

1440
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,720
linux or wikipedia where the community

1441
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,240
was really building a thing but i'm not

1442
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,280
sure there's going to be a thing i think

1443
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,839
there's going to be

1444
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,920
a big multiplicity of things built on

1445
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,280
this platform

1446
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,280
by the way i wasn't implying it'd be one

1447
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,240
thing no no no okay right i mean loops

1448
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,520
can be closed on niches yeah

1449
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,920
dick

1450
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,240
yeah um dick rowe i'm

1451
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:43,119
with open learning exchange which is

1452
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:45,280
kind of a child if you will of ocw

1453
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,880
we're we're we're starting with the

1454
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,480
assumption that

1455
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,760
to really

1456
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,920
meet the

1457
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,079
goal of universal basic education you

1458
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,240
have to start with with young kids you

1459
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,680
have to start basically the elementary

1460
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,720
and then following with a secondary

1461
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,240
level

1462
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,000
and we're starting also with the

1463
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,720
assumption that forget for this to

1464
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,440
happen it has to be done at that local

1465
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,960
country level it can't be

1466
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,680
a central place which is then

1467
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,319
distributed but in fact the actual

1468
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,240
course development has to be done within

1469
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,000
the context of each country so we've

1470
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,319
identified 100 countries around the

1471
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,319
world where we're helping to open what

1472
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,359
we're calling open learning exchange

1473
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,760
centers

1474
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:28,720
that have the responsibility for

1475
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,000
defining what it is needed for to meet

1476
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,720
the goal by 2015 of universal basic

1477
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,720
education for their country

1478
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,599
and to have the resources to be able to

1479
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:42,880
develop that content in an open source

1480
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,839
manner to my to my left here is uh is

1481
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,799
matthew carlos who is the librarian for

1482
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,119
the billion kids library we have an open

1483
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,960
source free billion kids library that

1484
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,559
we're developing where all of the

1485
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,760
content developed in each of these

1486
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,520
countries

1487
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,240
customized and localized for that

1488
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,280
country in fact is shared on a global

1489
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,040
basis through this billion kids library

1490
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,520
a key element of that which is the

1491
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,599
quality control issue the certification

1492
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,559
is that every item in that library will

1493
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,559
have a field for comment and rating

1494
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,480
and the comments you have to be a member

1495
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,720
of the network to comment and rate but

1496
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,720
then we know a bit about who those are

1497
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,839
so that fourth grade math teacher in

1498
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,599
brazil can say give me the fourth grade

1499
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,240
math courses that have been rated by

1500
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,440
teachers and students at least a four or

1501
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,000
five right

1502
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:35,040
five star rating that way they can begin

1503
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,520
select by the users themselves what is

1504
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:40,480
quality and not and it's all an open

1505
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,400
source it really spins off of ocw if

1506
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:46,079
that's the idea so we think of ourselves

1507
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,480
as the child of ocw focusing primarily

1508
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,240
on elementary education but also

1509
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,839
addressing and hopefully with mit

1510
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,680
addressing some of the secondaries as

1511
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,680
well but our focus is really on

1512
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,680
okay elementary and then mary can i ask

1513
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,680
you to speak next

1514
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,400
first question up there

1515
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,160
so my question um or more comment to

1516
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,520
address the issue of scalability that

1517
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:14,000
was talked about earlier um and also the

1518
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,079
the problem that we seem to see about if

1519
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,079
you open it to everyone and everyone can

1520
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,440
address or and everyone can add to it

1521
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,440
then you lose the warrants that you were

1522
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,839
talking about but why not do what a lot

1523
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,200
of companies do which is outsource

1524
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,839
different parts

1525
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,839
of the business so to speak so for

1526
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:32,400
example with

1527
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,480
so mit we're really good at engineering

1528
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,240
and with some other fields and so we do

1529
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,640
that really well and those sections and

1530
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,240
open courseware are done really well but

1531
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,599
then there's like other fields so for

1532
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,559
example

1533
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,839
truck driving we don't do that at mit so

1534
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,440
we could have

1535
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,760
people who do do that who their

1536
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,720
profession is training truck drivers and

1537
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,559
then if mit or some other organization

1538
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,480
kind of certifies that and then it

1539
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,480
becomes part of

1540
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,200
the website so it's kind of

1541
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,280
a mechanism of outsourcing and then

1542
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,799
bringing back into the fold and then

1543
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,319
that way you get your warrants because

1544
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,119
the people who are doing or who are

1545
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,480
adding the content of that specific area

1546
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,480
are then professionals in their field

1547
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,160
they know what they're doing

1548
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,480
and so then that's where you'd get your

1549
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,920
warrants

1550
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,040
i think it's already happening to some

1551
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,640
extent

1552
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,160
you know like medical education is being

1553
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,240
done by somebody stanford is doing

1554
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,319
something you know people in japan are

1555
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,599
doing something you know south koreans

1556
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,640
are doing something

1557
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,720
indian

1558
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,640
iits are doing something so it's already

1559
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,119
going on

1560
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,119
it's little early

1561
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,520
but i do want to

1562
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,319
i feel a little bit nervous about a

1563
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,319
model like that because this isn't about

1564
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,480
you know mit and

1565
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,640
20 other places dividing up knowledge

1566
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,079
and providing certification that's

1567
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,440
that's not the way this platform is

1568
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,680
going to grow as

1569
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,599
chuck and john just said this is not

1570
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:01,920
it's not at the place where it is

1571
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,040
appropriate or even possible to think

1572
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,200
about

1573
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,880
about closing it off this is not

1574
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,319
you know mit statement in open course

1575
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,599
here's what we do

1576
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,720
you don't have to like what we do you

1577
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,079
don't have to think it's any good but

1578
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,680
it's what we do

1579
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,839
and there have to be lots of other

1580
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:19,520
places that say here's what we do

1581
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,799
um you mentioned medical education let

1582
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,280
me just marry

1583
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:27,119
mary to say something about tusk

1584
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,240
hi i'm mary lee from tufts university uh

1585
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:32,960
we have been working on the tufts

1586
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:36,079
university sciences knowledge base

1587
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,040
for about 12 years now and

1588
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,280
it's

1589
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,799
a system that is built with open source

1590
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,040
software

1591
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,200
that's a powerful infrastructure for

1592
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,400
health sciences education

1593
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,599
what it allows

1594
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,160
institutions to do is build their own

1595
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,319
content but also share it

1596
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,599
the system is used by several schools in

1597
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,000
the u.s

1598
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,720
several countries in africa and actually

1599
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,559
more recently in india

1600
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,920
and it allows faculty actually to

1601
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,160
collaborate

1602
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,319
not only across disciplines but also

1603
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,280
across countries

1604
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,839
so faculty as their share we also are

1605
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,240
part of the open courseware consortium

1606
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:20,160
uh we have courses from our medical

1607
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,520
school dental school veterinary school

1608
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,040
nutrition school

1609
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,520
uh as well as

1610
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,040
our fletcher school law and diplomacy

1611
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:31,200
and these courses

1612
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,400
certainly are shared but

1613
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,000
we also do curriculum co-development

1614
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,400
with these countries

1615
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,359
so our faculty and medicine and public

1616
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,280
health

1617
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:43,200
and these other disciplines

1618
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,599
actually work with faculty in these

1619
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,599
other countries to create content that

1620
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:51,119
is locally relevant

1621
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:54,079
so it's a it's a combination of sharing

1622
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:55,839
core content on that

1623
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,400
really

1624
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:00,480
allows them to leverage faculty that

1625
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,040
some of these countries do not have

1626
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,319
so for instance in on the consortium in

1627
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:08,559
east africa

1628
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:10,160
there is one pathologist who flies

1629
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,480
across three countries to teach

1630
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,240
pathology to medical students

1631
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,000
well with uh

1632
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,640
sharing content

1633
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,880
uh you can actually have other faculty

1634
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,160
at these institutions help to teach that

1635
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,559
pathology

1636
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,559
um in addition to that one pathologist

1637
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,680
who's who's the expert who's flying

1638
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,559
around

1639
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:33,839
um so i think we're going to see

1640
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:36,480
a pretty rapid development

1641
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:39,760
in these in these countries which really

1642
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,680
have major faculty shortages

1643
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,000
but able to leverage

1644
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,480
faculty from here from other countries

1645
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,559
who are willing to share their content

1646
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,599
and co-develop the content which then

1647
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,359
can be

1648
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:55,359
customized to the local needs and

1649
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,240
the other thing that the system allows

1650
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,520
is

1651
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:02,400
because it's a very powerful

1652
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,640
database structure every learning object

1653
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,799
that's in the system

1654
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:10,880
is tagged with metadata so that all of

1655
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:14,000
the content can be reused and repurposed

1656
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,559
and so histology which is taught about

1657
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,640
across dental the dental curriculum the

1658
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,200
veterinary curriculum the medical

1659
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,280
curriculum actually those learning

1660
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,200
objects can be used and reused across

1661
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,760
all those disciplines so

1662
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,760
it allows

1663
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,559
incredible

1664
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,640
leveraging of the content not only

1665
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,760
within an institution but across all of

1666
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,480
these institutions that are

1667
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,480
participating

1668
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,520
if i may just say

1669
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,359
one thing we have to

1670
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,119
pay a lot of attention to is a multiple

1671
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,960
meanings to content and you know your

1672
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:51,520
content in terms of learning objects is

1673
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,839
both content and activities

1674
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,760
and a lot of the repositioning of it to

1675
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,039
different cultures different contexts

1676
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,960
has to do with actually changing the

1677
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,359
activities and i think we kind of

1678
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,680
overlook how rich we could get if people

1679
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:05,680
contributed new kinds of activities you

1680
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,520
know to the content so to speak in terms

1681
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,760
of you know because very often for

1682
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,400
example it is the problem sets that

1683
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,319
really determine how good a course is

1684
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,680
and finding better and better problems

1685
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:18,720
such as something can be done in a very

1686
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,720
kind of microwave

1687
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:26,400
could i just uh

1688
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:30,000
ask the the members of the panel

1689
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:33,680
if you would concur that

1690
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,839
the configuration of control

1691
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,240
the the ability and i think the question

1692
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:40,960
about verifying learning that was asked

1693
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,119
by this gentleman over here earlier goes

1694
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,280
to the heart of it

1695
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,319
or one element of the heart of it that

1696
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:50,960
we have a very set established in the

1697
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:55,280
united states and most other countries

1698
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:56,799
concept a hierarchy of power control and

1699
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,119
authority

1700
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:02,559
in which standards are determined by

1701
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:05,440
experts who almost always have been men

1702
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:08,160
in rooms with the door closed

1703
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,400
riding the encyclopedia britannica

1704
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,760
now i'm

1705
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,640
charactering it of course

1706
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,680
against which now you have

1707
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:20,240
legions of people in a flat world

1708
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:23,920
reinterpreting and remodifying and

1709
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:26,880
restating and dare we say socializing

1710
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,359
standards and reality and modifying it

1711
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,680
in a way that is literally

1712
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,760
uncontrollable

1713
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,359
by any terms that we have understood

1714
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,799
historically

1715
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:40,240
and so to me one of the riddles we face

1716
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,039
as we go forward because i think it's

1717
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,839
like

1718
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,119
trying to stop water from going down a

1719
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,960
mountain

1720
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,440
you aren't going to stop the tendency

1721
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,359
what we have to figure out is how to

1722
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,359
understand it

1723
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:56,160
that then led me to think

1724
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:59,280
about an itinerant professor

1725
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,599
in the 15th century going to a village

1726
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,880
and talking to people how different is

1727
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,359
that

1728
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,880
from a learning group formed

1729
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,400
on the net

1730
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,000
that begins to

1731
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,200
talk with each other

1732
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,440
about something they share in common

1733
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,520
the former led to something we know as

1734
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,720
universities

1735
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,160
over time

1736
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,799
and what we're trying to imagine now is

1737
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,880
what the latter will lead to

1738
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:28,319
in some future iteration

1739
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,079
but under it is the societal control

1740
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,520
it seems to me in determination and

1741
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,160
definition of quality and standards

1742
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,160
and i'm i'm curious as to whether people

1743
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,559
i'm not i'm worried about it i'm not

1744
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,400
worried in a negative sense about it

1745
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,640
but in how do we understand it how do we

1746
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,880
get on this horse and write it and

1747
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,720
understand it do you see those kinds of

1748
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,039
things up for grabs

1749
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,280
in this

1750
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,640
migration we've started where we don't

1751
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,480
know

1752
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,480
where the ultimate destination is

1753
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,200
at the moment

1754
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:08,240
i think we have the modern day

1755
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:11,680
equivalent of the itinerant

1756
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,760
professor comes by and

1757
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,359
leaves his notes

1758
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,839
here's what i know

1759
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:19,680
and then leaves the

1760
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:21,680
conversation and the group continues i

1761
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,319
think that's really what we are

1762
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,280
talking about here and i recognize now

1763
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:28,240
maybe

1764
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,480
why i missed larry's point because i was

1765
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,240
answering it in the context of

1766
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,440
that person leaving the notes can

1767
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,920
certify

1768
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,280
the quality of the information knowledge

1769
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,319
and structure that he or she has left

1770
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,640
but

1771
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:45,839
we are not at least at this point in the

1772
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,160
business of certifying what the people

1773
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:49,839
have gained from that and did it

1774
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,640
and whether

1775
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:55,280
they are now qualified in in some way

1776
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,960
and what is interesting

1777
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,640
many things it's fascinating about the

1778
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,240
evolution of

1779
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,640
both mit's ocw and the larger notion

1780
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,640
and the larger movement is what i tried

1781
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,760
to say about the origins was really

1782
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,039
about

1783
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,200
what does a university do in this world

1784
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,680
and the real excitement that is emerging

1785
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,440
is what individuals do with it and i

1786
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,079
don't think we know how we do that

1787
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,760
second level of certification

1788
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,520
or whether we should

1789
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,720
you know again the different types of

1790
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,400
signals that we're going to be

1791
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,400
encountering and one of those signals

1792
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,240
are going to be more the portfolios i

1793
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,799
mean so somebody comes to you and

1794
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,039
presents a portfolio uh just like

1795
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,799
seriously i don't look if somebody they

1796
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,400
come from mit i look at what lab do they

1797
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,160
come from who do they study under

1798
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,079
there's a much more micro thing we

1799
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,680
already use in terms of those signals

1800
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,440
and i think looking at a portfolio now

1801
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,960
the question is at some point that

1802
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,400
finesse is a problem

1803
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,200
who has the authority to be able to

1804
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:53,359
evaluate the the portfolio but but you

1805
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,680
know what is so wonderful and we tend to

1806
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:58,079
over journalize this in open source

1807
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,440
you know truth is determined by does

1808
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,720
this code run

1809
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,480
you know so you actually have an

1810
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,960
arbitrator sitting behind the scenes

1811
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,559
there which simplified

1812
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,400
the mechanisms to make open source

1813
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,480
really flourish we move to these other

1814
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,960
domains we don't have that kind of

1815
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,559
intrinsic arbitrator so we come back to

1816
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,559
much more serious types of questions

1817
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:22,719
my comment perhaps addresses questions

1818
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,440
sorry

1819
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,920
okay my comment addresses perhaps this

1820
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,920
question that has been discussed in the

1821
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,839
last few minutes

1822
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,560
if we are all moving to individual

1823
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,719
learners and that this platform is

1824
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,199
providing that opportunity

1825
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,319
then is there no room for the meta

1826
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,000
learner

1827
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,799
because it seems to me that if you

1828
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,960
cannot certify what is being learned and

1829
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:49,199
if the market is not clearing the

1830
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,359
tinkering products because if the if you

1831
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,799
are tinkering with products the market

1832
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,199
can clear those

1833
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,640
who is going to be clearing the market

1834
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:58,799
of learning

1835
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,480
uh is is there no room for a meta

1836
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:03,440
learner and i think that's perhaps a

1837
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:04,480
question that i'm posing to the panel to

1838
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:08,000
see

1839
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,000
what your thoughts are on that

1840
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,880
so i don't think anyone knows but

1841
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,679
i'm very optimistic

1842
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,640
so if we relate this to what peter just

1843
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,080
asked

1844
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,920
about

1845
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,520
where's the authoritative place and who

1846
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,920
is going to be doing this you know this

1847
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,520
is exactly if we go back

1848
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,279
four years

1849
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,679
the the discussion that the news media

1850
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,799
was having around blogs right there all

1851
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,000
these people are going to put stuff on

1852
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,359
the internet and there's all this junk

1853
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,159
and all this crap

1854
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:42,080
you know and that's not over yet

1855
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:44,719
but the result has been

1856
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,839
there is still the notion of quality but

1857
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:49,759
it's based on an incredibly

1858
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:52,400
richer version of discourse and what i

1859
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:54,239
would hope is that we'll see the same

1860
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,880
kind of thing happen

1861
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:59,920
as you open up these these sort of micro

1862
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,360
ways to get together for education now

1863
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,760
you know this isn't going to happen for

1864
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,520
several for several years but

1865
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,880
the other thing that it tells you

1866
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,840
from the world of blogs is that it could

1867
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,560
happen pretty fast once it gets going so

1868
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:16,520
i'm pretty optimistic

1869
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,520
and take multiple forms right
