O'Neal MIT postdoctoral researcher

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,720
Franchesco Benedetti admits he was not

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,279
always a star student but the people he

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,000
met along his educational Journey

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:33,000
inspired him to strive which led him to

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,719
conduct research at MIT launch a startup

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,960
and even lead the team that won the

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,399
2021 MIT 100K entrepreneurship

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,879
competition now he is determined to make

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,440
sure that his company osmosis succeeds

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,879
in boosting the Energy Efficiency of

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,520
traditional and renewable natural gas

17
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,120
processing hydrogen production and

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,079
carbon capture thus helping to address

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,559
climate change I can't be grateful

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,199
enough to MIT for bringing together a

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,200
community of people who want to change

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,520
the world Benedetti says now we have a

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,840
technology that can solve one of the big

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,119
problems of our society Benedetti and

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,080
his team have developed an Innovative

26
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,799
way to separate molecules using a

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,799
membrane fine enough to extract

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,640
impurities such as carbon dioxide or

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,520
hydrogen sulfide from raw natural gas to

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,240
obtain a higher quality fuel fulfilling

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,680
a crucial need in the energy industry

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,759
natural gas now provides about 40% of

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,360
the energy used to power homes in

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,280
industry in the United States Benedetti

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,399
says using his team's technology to

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,240
upgrade natural gas more efficiently

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,719
could reduce emissions of greenhouse

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,880
gases while saving energy to power the

39
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,399
equivalent of 7 million additional us

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,920
homes for a year he

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,119
adds the MI

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,479
Community Benedetti first came to MIT in

43
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,360
2017 as a visiting student from the

44
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,440
University of bolognia in Italy where he

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,519
was working on membranes for gas

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,959
separation for his PhD in chemical

47
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,160
engineering having completed a master's

48
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,560
thesis on water desalination at the

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,040
University of Texas at Austin he

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,840
connected with University of Texas Alum

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,920
Zachary P Smith who is the Robert and

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,040
noise Career Development professor

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,280
professor of chemical engineering at MIT

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,800
and the two discovered they shared a

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
vision we found ourselves very much

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,200
aligned on the need for new technology

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,080
in Industry to lower the energy

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,319
consumption of separating components

59
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Benedetti says although Benedetti had

60
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
always been interested in making a

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,080
positive impact on the world

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,080
particularly the environment he says it

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
was his university studies that first

64
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,879
sparked his interest in more efficient

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,400
separation Technologies when you study

66
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,400
chemical engineering you understand

67
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,480
hundreds of ways the field can have a

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,319
positive impact in the world but we

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,519
learn very early that 15% of the world's

70
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,920
energy is wasted because of inefficient

71
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,519
chemical separation because we still

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,920
rely on centuries old technology he

73
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,159
says most separation processes still use

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,599
heat or toxic solvents to separate

75
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,319
components he explains still Benedetti

76
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,519
says his main Drive comes from the joy

77
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,040
of working with terrific mentors and

78
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,360
colleagues it's the people I've met that

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,000
really inspired me to tackle the biggest

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,239
challenges and find that intrinsic

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,080
motivation he says to help build his

82
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,280
community at MIT and provide support for

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,239
international students Benedetti

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,400
co-founded the MIT visiting Student

85
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,760
Association or Vista in September of

86
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,400
2017 by February

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,040
2018 the organization had hundreds of

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,599
members and an official Institute

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,120
recognition in May of 2018 the group won

90
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,079
two Institute Awards including the

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,760
golden Beaver award for enhancing the

92
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,959
campus environment Vista gave me a sense

93
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,519
of belonging I loved it Benedetti says

94
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,600
membrane

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,840
technology Benedetti also published two

96
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,040
papers on membrane research during his

97
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,080
stint as a visiting student at MIT so he

98
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,479
was delighted to return in 20 2019 for

99
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,400
postdoctoral work through the MIT energy

100
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,840
initiative where he was a 2019 through

101
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,520
2020 xon mobile MIT energy

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,000
fellow I came back because the research

103
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,120
was extremely exciting but also because

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,720
I got extremely passionate about the

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,400
energy I found on campus and with the

106
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,639
people he says returning to MIT enabled

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,720
Benedetti to continue his work with

108
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:02,520
Smith and Holden lie both of whom helped

109
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,360
to co-found O mosis Li a recent Stanford

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,000
PhD in chemistry who was also a visiting

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,759
student at MIT in 2018 is now the chief

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,360
technology officer at

113
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,840

115
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,919
2017 an MIT PhD candidate joined the

116
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,800
team more

117
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,639
recently together the osmosis team has

118
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,960
developed polymer membranes with

119
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,759
microporosities capable of filtering

120
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,600
gases by separating out molecules that

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,520
differ by as little as a fraction of an

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,440
angstrom a unit of length equal to 100th

123
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,039
of a

124
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,440
CM we can get up to five times higher

125
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,199
selectivity than commercially available

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,960
technology for methane upgrading and

127
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,280
this has been observed operating the

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,840
membranes in industrially relevant

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,280
environments Benedetti says today

130
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
methane upgrading or removing carbon

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,800
dioxide from raw natural gas to obtain a

132
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,319
higher grade fuel fuel is often

133
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,039
accomplished using amine absorption

134
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,440
which is a process that uses toxic

135
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,080
solvents to capture carbon dioxide and

136
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,599
burns methane to fuel the Regeneration

137
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,520
of the solvents for reuse using osmosis

138
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,919
filters would eliminate the need for

139
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,080
such solvents while reducing carbon

140
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,280
dioxide emissions by up to 16 million

141
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,280
metric tons per year in the United

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,319
States alone Benedetti says the

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,080
technology has a wide range of

144
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,759
applications in oxygen and nitrogen

145
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,360
generation hydrogen purification and

146
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,000
carbon capture for example but osmosis

147
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,120
plans to start with a $5 billion market

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,759
for natural gas upgrading because the

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
need to bring Innovation and

150
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,960
sustainability to that space is urgent

151
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,960
says bened Didi who received guidance

152
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,400
and bringing technology to Market from

153
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,360
mit's Desh Pand Center for technological

154
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,199
innovation the osmosis team has also

155
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,720
received support from the MIT sandbox

156
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,639
inov a fund program the next step for

157
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,479
the startup is to build an industrial

158
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,960
scale prototype and Benedetti says the

159
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,800
company got a huge boost toward that

160
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,080
goal in May when it won the MIT 100K

161
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,280
entrepreneurship competition which is a

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,199
student run contest that has launched

163
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,080
more than 160 companies since it began

164
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,680
in

165
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,599
1990 90 teams began the competition by

166
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,840
pitching their startup ideas 20 received

167
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,000
mentorship and deved development funding

168
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,360
then eight finalists presented business

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,120
plans to compete for the $100,000 prize

170
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,280
because of this we're getting a lot of

171
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,160
interest from Venture Capital firms

172
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,080
investors companies and corporate funds

173
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,520
that want to partner with us or to use

174
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,560
our product he says in June the osmosis

175
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,599
team received a 2-year activate

176
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,680
Fellowship which will support moving its

177
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,240
research to Market in October it won the

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
northeast regional and carbon

179
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,240
sequestration prizes at the clean tech

180
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,479
open accelerator and in November the

181
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:10,319
team closed a $3 million preed round of

182
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,199
financing fail naturally Benedetti hopes

183
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,080
osmosis is on the path to success but he

184
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,960
wants everyone to know that there is no

185
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,120
shame in failures that come from the

186
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,479
best efforts he admits it took him 3

187
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,240
years longer than usual to finish his

188
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,520
undergraduate and master's degrees and

189
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,639
