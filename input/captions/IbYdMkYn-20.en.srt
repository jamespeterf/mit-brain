1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,200
okay good

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,200
afternoon so we are

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,160
back with chemical

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,160
reactions systems subject to chemical

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,199
reactions and

6
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,160
today we will uh talk about the

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,160
statement of the second

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,719
law and a small detail that is in there

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,440
that regards chemical reactions and then

10
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,600
we'll

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,600
start playing

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,840
some uh more

13
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:59,600
interesting physics of of how chemical

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
reactions happen

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,439
so remember that in order to describe

16
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,439
the chemical reaction mechanism we

17
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,759
Define uh an

18
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,680
equation uh which we can write in

19
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,400
various

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,720
forms formally the generic chemical

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,680
equation reaction mechanism can be

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,439
written this way where these are the

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,280
chemical symbols and these are the

24
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,960
stochiometric

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,960
coefficients okay and the

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
proportionality

27
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:41,040
relations uh

28
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:44,880
relate changes the possible changes in

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,920
composition now uh let's go back to the

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,119
statement of the second law this is the

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,159
the same slide that we have seen

32
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,119
um long

33
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,759
ago second lecture I believe and

34
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,960
uh or maybe even the first uh where I

35
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,159
added some more specifics

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,560
because we didn't stress it then but in

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,520
the statement we wrote that

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,040
um in the subset of states of a system

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,280
compatible with given values of the

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,879
amounts of

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,160
constituents I sort of skipped

42
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,640
discussing what that compatible means

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,640
because now we have the tools so

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,640
compatible means

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,720
that uh the amounts of constituents may

46
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:41,519
be different may change according to an

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,519
internal mechanism such as a chemical

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,640
reaction so in fact when we fix when we

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
say that there is a stable equilibrium

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,519
state for each value of the energy the

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,360
amounts of constituents and the

52
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,800
parameters it's

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,080
really uh it's it's not exactly the

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,599
amount of constituent

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,799
but it's a given set of compatible uh

56
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,640
possible U

57
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,400
compositions corresponding to for

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,640
example an initial am set of amounts so

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,810
for example suppose we say we

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,879
characterize a a set of

61
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,000
[Music]

62
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:30,200
compatible uh amounts of constituents by

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,040
a given set of values of amounts like an

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,640
initial set we put molecules in a box

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,599
then we close the

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,080
box but then uh the chemical reactions

67
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,480
can change these amounts due

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,920
to the collisions and the and the

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,200
reactions themselves so according to

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,200
these

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:04:01,720
relation so that defines what we mean by

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,720
compatible and also here it says that

73
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,280
from any initial uh

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
composition and the values of the

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,239
parameters we can reach a stable

76
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,199
equilibrium state by means of a

77
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,519
reversible weight

78
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:24,160
process uh that's really true also if

79
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:28,160
you can change the composition

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,600
compatibly with the chemical reaction

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,720
mechanisms that you have defined as part

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,320
of your of your model as being possible

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,440
for your system remember that we're

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,479
always talking about a model okay so in

85
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,800
a model you specify what the what the

86
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,240
constituents are and also you have to

87
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,360
specify what the uh allowed chemical

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,440
reaction mechanisms

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,400
are you

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,479
change one of these for example you you

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,880
add one chemical reaction that is a

92
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,080
different

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,560
system so it's part of the definition of

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,560
system is also

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,360
this all right so what the what does

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,600
that

97
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,120
imply well it

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,199
implies that since the composition can

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,880
change they

100
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,759
become like properties from state to

101
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,080
state you have different composition so

102
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,160
you can measure uh what's the current

103
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,440
composition something that you can

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,440
measure uh corresponds to a

105
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:43,280
property so the amounts become

106
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
properties and at stable

107
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,919
equilibrium there is only

108
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,319
one

109
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,960
uh uh stable equilibrium state that

110
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,080
means there is only one composition that

111
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,000
stable that is a stable equilibrium for

112
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,639
the given set of parameters energy and

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,919
compatible composition so that means

114
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,280
that within that set of compatible

115
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:14,400
composition only one for each value of

116
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,800
the energy is a a stable equilibrium

117
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,039
composition all right so we have to deal

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,520
with this uh difficulties so we

119
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,520
can somehow

120
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,880
restate uh the the state principle and

121
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,880
the maximum entropy principle

122
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,560
what I just

123
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,120
said is that any property and now that

124
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,000
list of properties includes the

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,400
amounts of

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,800
constituents uh is

127
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,319
uniquely uh fixed by the state so the

128
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,039
once you once you have a stable

129
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,639
equilibrium State and you have one for

130
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,000
each value of the energy volume initial

131
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,319
amounts and stochiometric coefficients

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,599
that defin what the mechanisms are in

133
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
play okay for that

134
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,879
one that fixes the state and therefore

135
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,240
fixes the values of all the properties

136
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,400
therefore each property is only at

137
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
stable equilibrium because this is true

138
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,160
only at stable equilibrium is a function

139
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,039
of these variables and only

140
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,400
these and among these

141
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:33,720
properties is the

142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:39,319
amounts so we call n Sub Zero the

143
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,520
amounts that Prevail at uh stable

144
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,360
equilibrium so in addition to the

145
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,000
fundamental relation for the entropy

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,280
which is this

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
one with which we have played a lot in

148
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,879
Computing derivatives properties

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,199
temperature chemical potential pressure

150
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,800
and so

151
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,360
on we now have also another

152
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,840
we could call it another fundamental

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,319
relation for

154
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,520
composition or

155
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:14,520
equivalently since composition and

156
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:18,639
reaction coordinates are related this

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,199
way you can also write it equivalently

158
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,639
this is not an extra equation in terms

159
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,720
of uh the Epsilon and here I have to

160
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,720
correct this must be

161
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:34,880
epsilon0 okay

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,880
the maximum entropy principle then

163
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:41,200
says that among all the

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,719
states and here in the slide I didn't

165
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,880
write it explicitly so now we should we

166
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,720
we should go back and

167
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,320
correct uh States compatible with given

168
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,760
initial amounts of constituents

169
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,000
parameters and energy so among all these

170
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,120
states and there are many uh the stable

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,519
equilibrium state is the one with the

172
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,839
maximum Maxum

173
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,600
entropy and we shall use this condition

174
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,120
of Maximum

175
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,720
entropy in a moment to determine what

176
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,720
the equilibrium composition

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:30,000
is in order to do so we have to Define

178
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,519
better or maybe let's say refine

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,720
with an important little detail the

180
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,800
simple system model namely the model

181
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,240
that applies when we have many particles

182
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,240
large

183
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:52,440
and remember this slide which tells us

184
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:55,720
how strong the chemical bonds may

185
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,720
be and

186
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,800
yet as a result of

187
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,360
cions these chemical bonds can be broken

188
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:12,200
to form more stable

189
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,000
ones or in fact also the collisions of

190
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,640
these more stable ones sometimes if the

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,839
Collision is strong

192
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:25,160
enough can produce the breakup into uh

193
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,079
products that are lesser stable and

194
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,760
actually at equilibrium the mechanism

195
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:33,839
that goes in One Direction equilibrates

196
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,360
uh the rate at which things go in One

197
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,240
Direction uh he equilibrates the rate in

198
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
the opposite

199
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,200
direction so this slide you'll read it

200
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,320
later on but simply wants to talk about

201
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,480
collisions I actually added this

202
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,880
Photograph this morning because I was

203
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,959
passing in the

204
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,800
fourth floor Corridor in um building 10

205
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,000
where you probably uh have gone and seen

206
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,959
these photographs by doc

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,720
Edgerton

208
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:16,880
um and you see how uh a

209
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:19,720
collision uh between a golf club and the

210
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,399
golf ball can

211
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,920
deform the ball which if you take it in

212
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,200
your hands you know it's kind of hard it

213
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,320
looks like a very hard almost a hard

214
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,720
sphere yet

215
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:41,480
uh the photograph shows that even

216
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,480
in I think uh yeah it says six six

217
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,399
milliseconds uh I think it takes six

218
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,079
milliseconds or less to uh during that

219
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,079
impact which is very

220
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,920
short

221
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,800
uh the

222
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:02,279
particle gets deformed so much so it

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,279
since it is elastic it absorbs the

224
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,519
energy kinetic energy that comes from

225
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,959
from the club and it becomes the

226
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:14,000
formation energy like a spring and then

227
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,199
that energy stored in the spring uh will

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,519
be

229
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,740
released very quickly so in the case of

230
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,959
the golf Bowl it

231
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,839
[Music]

232
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,320
will hit it at a very long distance in

233
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,079
the case of

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:34,519
molecules it may

235
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:38,760
generate uh the breaking of some of the

236
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:41,800
weaker bonds and uh the formation of

237
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,880
other more stable

238
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,079
bonds there is also this other video in

239
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,320
YouTube which shows you

240
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:54,160
again

241
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:58,880
um the impact of a golf club of a

242
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,880
golf bow into a rigid really rigid wall

243
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,600
it's see how it it's impressive how it

244
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,120
deforms it becomes almost flat and then

245
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,959
it begins to oscillate as it goes

246
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,880
away very impressive so this is uh

247
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,800
collisions are play an important role in

248
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
chemical

249
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
reactions now so let's introduce now

250
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,800
this

251
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,880
concept that we will call

252
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,000
the activated

253
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,560
complex as a result of a collision

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
between

255
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,399
molecules

256
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,880
typically as you

257
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:49,079
know uh by thermal agitation molecules

258
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,079
are move around and have many

259
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:58,399
collisions per second billions and and

260
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:03,199
um as a result of these collisions they

261
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,199
get deformed they do what we just said

262
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,160
sometimes uh the combined kinetic energy

263
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:13,160
of the colliding uh atoms or molecules

264
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,440
are enough to

265
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,759
form um

266
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,880
a sort of an unstable

267
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:27,240
compound which we will call activated

268
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:30,399
complex and uh call it with the star on

269
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,160
top and this compound

270
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,120
is momentary is

271
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,600
momentary lives it's very short lived

272
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,600
and uh it's

273
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,040
unstable and uh and this is where if it

274
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,040
decays the proper way in other words if

275
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,360
it if the uh elastic energy the

276
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,880
vibrational energies get the get um move

277
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,120
to the right uh to the right bonds so as

278
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,240
to break them and to uh so so that the

279
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,240
atoms are free to recombine in a

280
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,000
different way then you'll have an

281
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,920
effective Collision that will transform

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,920
your reactants in

283
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,320
products

284
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:21,600
uh of

285
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:26,199
course this is um Contour through

286
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,959
Contour plot of a of

287
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,399
a of a diagram that wants to represent

288
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,160
uh

289
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:37,759
here the most stable

290
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,000
potential configuration that represents

291
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:45,759
the potential energy of your say uh AB

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,120
plus C is the products okay and

293
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:53,720
here the in this bottom of this other

294
00:15:49,120 --> 00:16:00,199
Valley uh you have the potential

295
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:02,240
energy combined of the uh reactants

296
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:06,319
and

297
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,360
um so typically if you are at zero

298
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:15,240
temperature particles don't move no

299
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:19,120
collisions no chance to reach uh uh

300
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,759
enough energy to overcome because you

301
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,319
see this is a it's like two

302
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,440
valys and this is a subtle point that

303
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,800
connects the two valys okay and this one

304
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,600
which is uh this dashed line

305
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,600
represents the like the

306
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,360
bottom let's say the steepest ascent and

307
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,759
steepest

308
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,120
descent uh path uh from the reactant

309
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:50,240
Valley to

310
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,240
the product Valley of the potential

311
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,959
energy so if energy is only potential

312
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:58,000
you are at zero

313
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,519
temperature and the particles will like

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,720
to stay in the

315
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,199
bottom but as soon as the temperature

316
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,640
increases the collisions the kinetic

317
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,720
energy uh allows for collisions and the

318
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,000
collisions allows particles to put

319
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,880
energy together and therefore they can

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,919
uh move

321
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,280
around in these valleys and uh and find

322
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,400
themselves in configurations that are

323
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,880
not not the most stable but momentarily

324
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,960
they can live also in very unstable

325
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,039
situations along the sides of the valley

326
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,640
and sometimes they can even reach the

327
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,880
subtle

328
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Point perhaps also with additional

329
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,880
energy than just what is barely enough

330
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,880
to be

331
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:52,280
there so this

332
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,559
plot uh represents along this dust line

333
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,280
potential

334
00:17:53,559 --> 00:18:03,039
energy and here we are assuming that the

335
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:05,559
uh reactant Val is uh deeper than the um

336
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,559
product

337
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,720
Valley okay what is important for the

338
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,600
moment then we will when we do kinetics

339
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,640
um next

340
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,799
time uh we will also talk about how to

341
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,880
to model the rates at which this uh

342
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:30,120
climbing of the valley to the sdle point

343
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,480
happens but uh for the moment all that

344
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:37,679
we need to to know is

345
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:41,840
that this activated complex uh can be

346
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:46,799
treated can be it's literally a a new

347
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:49,120
compound so a super molecule in which U

348
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,039
all the atoms that are in in play are

349
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,000
very close to one another and they share

350
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:59,080
a lot of elastic energy exactly like the

351
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,280
golf bowl is uh deformed and then it

352
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,799
only depend in the and then NE once

353
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,360
you're there that thing could decay in

354
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,520
One Direction or could decay in the

355
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,280
other

356
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,240
direction so there is a chance that it

357
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,039
you are up here and you Decay down this

358
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,720
Valley or you can Decay the other Valley

359
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:23,360
after all this is an unstable

360
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,919
Point

361
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,919
okay so in principle

362
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,360
see in principle if you have a

363
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,360
box

364
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,840
uh in which you have

365
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,360
only say suppose you have just two

366
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,360
hydrogen

367
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:54,400
atoms so this

368
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:58,120
is and U now as a result so this is a

369
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,120
time say T1

370
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,280
at a later time as a result of

371
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,640
collisions they find

372
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:14,480
themselves in a highly deformed

373
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,720
situation uh like this very close to one

374
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,640
another this is the

375
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,520
activated

376
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,640
complex

377
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,400
and there as a result of the Collision

378
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,640
you could have two possibilities maybe I

379
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,640
should do this uh

380
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:41,039
that the thing

381
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:44,960
breaks back to having two hydrogen

382
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:47,960
atoms so maybe these ones were moving

383
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,360
this way they Collide here they form

384
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,799
this activated complex let

385
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:59,520
me put that just to say well it's it has

386
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:02,919
a lot of uh stored elastic energy in it

387
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,600
so one way is that that elastic energy

388
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:11,400
makes it explode in two uh two other uh

389
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,600
atoms that will move far away or it

390
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,559
could

391
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,159
also

392
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:22,559
uh if the angles of the collisions are

393
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:26,919
appropriate and so on you can also form

394
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,360
just a single uh single molecule that

395
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,760
would move away this way of course you

396
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,200
have to conserve also momentum so uh

397
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,520
this molecule will have the same

398
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,799
momentum that the sum of the two

399
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,840
momentum okay so this would be an

400
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,039
effective chemically effective Collision

401
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,720
that produces the chemical reaction and

402
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:51,240
this is an ineffective chemical

403
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Collision

404
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,039
just this kind of collisions the

405
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,880
ineffective ones are the ones that are

406
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,240
um also uh

407
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,360
responsible if you don't have to have to

408
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,240
go to this kind of extreme uh they are

409
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,840
responsible for redistributing the

410
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:15,400
energy between uh the various atoms in

411
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:19,600
your system and if you have enough

412
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,880
particles that will give you uh produce

413
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,799
the maxwellian distribution Maxwell bman

414
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,799
distribution of velocities okay

415
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,400
now you see here that uh for a system in

416
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,559
which there are only few particles like

417
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,919
two literally two particles here we have

418
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,679
those two particles have disappeared at

419
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,679
this moment in

420
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,360
time

421
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,520
uh in order to describe the the Dynamics

422
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,679
of this system or the properties as a

423
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,840
function of time we need to know also

424
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,279
the properties of this activated complex

425
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,679
because for some time it's the only

426
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,240
thing in our

427
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,480
box so if we want to describe properties

428
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,559
uh we have to know what the structure of

429
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,200
this molecule is and what's the specific

430
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,200
Heats and so

431
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:25,600
on uh so we treat this activated

432
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:29,600
complex as as a molecule in

433
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
itself however

434
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,120
yeah

435
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:44,400
uh okay let's uh uh do the the formal uh

436
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,400
discussion about

437
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,159
this so

438
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,559
essentially what this says is that

439
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,240
we we can

440
00:23:53,559 --> 00:24:00,520
split

441
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:04,919
the uh reaction mechanism into two

442
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:07,520
parts a forward half

443
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,520
reaction that that

444
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,520
takes uh the

445
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,480
reactants

446
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,840
and forms as a result of collision

447
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,840
between the reactants forms deactivated

448
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:29,399
complex and the backward half

449
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,960
reaction which is a result of collisions

450
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:36,960
between product molecules also gives

451
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
right uh gives rise to

452
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:48,640
this so you notice that we can write our

453
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:53,360
original overall reaction in this

454
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:56,880
way and by our rule since we have put

455
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:01,600
the positive stric coefficients for the

456
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,600
products and negative for the

457
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,039
reactants if you want to start from the

458
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,200
products and form the activated

459
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:16,399
complex you have to put this

460
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,559
uh put them this way and and so the net

461
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:22,720
uh stochiometric coefficient of the

462
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:26,399
original reaction is given by new minus

463
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,679
minus new plus the

464
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:31,399
the stochiometric coefficient eent of

465
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:36,440
the backward reaction minus the

466
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:36,440
stochiometric coefficient of the forward

467
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,000
reaction so now we have two reactions

468
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,600
instead of

469
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,159
one and

470
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,440
that's going to be very

471
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,120
important as we see here uh in order to

472
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,159
describe the

473
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,880
possibility for the reaction to

474
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,399
occur so this activated

475
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,000
complexes are fundamental you have to go

476
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:06,960
through that subtle point in order to go

477
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,200
from one Valley to the other other

478
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,399
Valley you can also go through higher

479
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,440
than the sdle point or any any path that

480
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:17,240
takes you from one Valley to the other

481
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,039
but the most probable is uh going

482
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,039
through the SLE

483
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,640
point

484
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,720
and so each reaction for each reaction

485
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,440
we have defined

486
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,760
properties like the enthalpy of the

487
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,039
reaction so the enthalpy of the re of

488
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,880
the overall reaction if you remember the

489
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,360
other time is the weighted sum on the

490
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
stochiometric weighted on the

491
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:50,399
stochiometric coefficients of the pure

492
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:54,000
component uh uh property at standard

493
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:58,240
U pressure in this kind in this in

494
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,960
this instance and and The Temper the

495
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:07,360
generic temperature T well we can

496
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:10,440
also apply this definition to this

497
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,679
reactions the half reactions in order to

498
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,720
do that I have to make the uh a half

499
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,520
reaction with all the components to the

500
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,520
left according to our rule so so if you

501
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,240
take this to the left now you see this

502
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,279
the product is a

503
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,760
star and the reactants are the AI with

504
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,320
this stochiometric coefficients A+ I

505
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
mean new

506
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:42,279
plus so in this summation I have to

507
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:46,640
take uh with the plus one coefficient

508
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:50,240
the enthalpy of the activated complex at

509
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,519
standard pressure and temperature T and

510
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,200
then put the stochiometric efficient

511
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:59,799
therefore minus these

512
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,799
things okay so that defines

513
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,440
the property of the forward half

514
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:10,480
reaction and this is the enthalpy of

515
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:13,799
the forward I mean backward half

516
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,760
reaction in order to Define them you

517
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,440
need to know your to have characterized

518
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,000
your activated complex because you need

519
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:26,039
to know its enthalpy at standard

520
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,559
conditions treating it as a

521
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,480
molecule so in a sense

522
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:36,240
because people don't really do

523
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,320
this um this is just a sort of a

524
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,200
hypothetical it's a way of looking at it

525
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:47,039
which will allow nevertheless to

526
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,960
uh Define a lot of useful things that

527
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,960
then people do

528
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,360
use okay

529
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,840
so in spite of the

530
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,519
fact that we have just

531
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,440
said that that the activated complex is

532
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,679
fundamental in order for the reactions

533
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,679
to

534
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:19,880
occur next we're going to neglect

535
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,399
them so but it is not contradiction

536
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,399
we're going to NE neglect them neglect

537
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,880
them uh for just one aspect namely for

538
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:32,080
calculating the properties of our

539
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,279
reacting

540
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,880
mixtures and only in a limit in which we

541
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:43,600
have many particles so this is an an

542
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:47,600
addendum to the simple system

543
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,159
model it amounts to saying uh the

544
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,640
following yes if I have a situation in

545
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,960
which I have only two particles this

546
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,320
passing through this is fundamental and

547
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,399
also when I take a photograph at this

548
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,080
instant of time

549
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:06,080
uh the 100% of the scenario is made up

550
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:10,120
of the activated complex there's

551
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,120
only but if I have many

552
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,440
particles it's true that there are many

553
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:20,880
collisions but they do not occur all at

554
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,840
once so that means that if I have many

555
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,440
particles uh in this box in addition to

556
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,559
the two particles that are going to

557
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,279
collide and form these there are also

558
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:36,120
large amount of other particles that are

559
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,120
not colliding in that

560
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,559
moment and since they form the

561
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,960
majority the mo fraction of the

562
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,120
activated complex is so

563
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,399
small that we can neglect its

564
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,240
contribution to the properties of the

565
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,559
mixture so in that

566
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,000
sense we say for many

567
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,080
particles and when we are dealing with

568
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,880
just looking at the properties for

569
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,120
making like energy and entropy balances

570
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,320
uh so properties like the entropy the

571
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:17,000
enpy and and the energy uh or the volume

572
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,320
we can we we we compute them by

573
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,120
neglecting the minute uh amounts of

574
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,120
activated complex that are there

575
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,720
so essentially what we're what we're

576
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,440
saying is that neglecting the activating

577
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,840
complex is like neglecting the existence

578
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:45,240
of the chemical reaction for the purpose

579
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,240
of computing the

580
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:53,039
properties in other

581
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,039
words

582
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,159
uh we assume when Computing properties

583
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,480
of mixtures that are reacting we assume

584
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,679
that they have the properties of the

585
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,000
mixture with the reactions so to speak

586
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,480
turned

587
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,799
off if I turn off the

588
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,960
reactions I stop the formation of

589
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,279
activated complex so there is no

590
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:20,840
activated complex in play and I'm in the

591
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:22,639
usual uh situation in which I have only

592
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,799
my

593
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:29,799
um original

594
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:29,799
particles although

595
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,200
uh we're not actually turning reactions

596
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:43,519
off but it's as if you

597
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,519
could uh although the reaction is

598
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:55,760
occurring and also what we are assuming

599
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,760
is that

600
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,159
um the

601
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,440
you see with the reactions uh uh if I

602
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,840
have this situation here and I turn uh

603
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,279
off the reactions and I still have an

604
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,480
activated complex that was already it

605
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,000
was already there because it was just

606
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,039
being

607
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,360
formed uh that

608
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:25,240
complex sometimes will break up like

609
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:30,679
explode so that

610
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,679
explosion uh delivers kinetic energy

611
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:40,360
locally so produces a non equilibrium

612
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,440
situation that amount of kinetic energy

613
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,120
which is concentrated here in this

614
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,440
bullets that go away from the

615
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,360
explosion and they are they have a

616
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,720
velocity which is much higher than the

617
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,600
typical

618
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:00,039
velocities it will take a

619
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,720
while for a the other collisions not of

620
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,320
the chemical kind to redistribute that

621
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,799
excess in ktic energy due to the

622
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,599
chemical reaction in redistributed to

623
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,599
the other molecules

624
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:13,599
around

625
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:22,280
okay well we will we also

626
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:26,119
assume that the

627
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,159
uh that this

628
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,760
non-chemical uh coll Vision

629
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,839
redistribution

630
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:37,280
mechanism is very fast so

631
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,879
fast that as soon as we turn off the

632
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,000
reactions or as soon as the activated

633
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:48,679
complex has decayed into its fragments

634
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,200
of of the Decay uh that energy gets

635
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,960
almost immediately redistributed among

636
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,879
all the other uh molecules so that they

637
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,119
reach immediately uh the stable

638
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,760
equilibrium state with with their with

639
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,160
the Frozen composition that they are in

640
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,160
at that

641
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,599
moment okay so these are all the

642
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,160
concepts that go

643
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,520
into the idea that then we are going to

644
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:19,320
uh model the properties of our system

645
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,320
with chemical

646
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,440
reactions as if they were not reacting

647
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,720
but in stable chemical I'm sorry in

648
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:45,359
stable

649
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,359
equilibrium uh for the instantaneous

650
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
composition talking in terms of

651
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,040
characteristic

652
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,520
times the chemical

653
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,960
reactions we think we consider them much

654
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:06,319
slow slower

655
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:10,560
than the redistribution mechanism by

656
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:13,880
Collision uh but chemically ineffective

657
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,760
collisions which instead are very

658
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,640
fast

659
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,960
and and therefore the chemical reactions

660
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,560
change the composition and according to

661
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,960
the

662
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:32,640
um proportionality relation

663
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:36,200
so the the the reaction coordinate does

664
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,319
advance in time but we assume that each

665
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:42,280
instant of time the system immediately

666
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:45,160
redistributes the energy caused uh the

667
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,400
the local excesses or defects of

668
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,160
energies produced by the chemical

669
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,880
reactions and the activated complex and

670
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,079
so on

671
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:59,160
and and therefore keeps uh the

672
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,560
state almost close to what it would be

673
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,960
uh stable equilibrium if you didn't have

674
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,960
chemical

675
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,319
reactions okay so that's the

676
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,200
scenario and of

677
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:19,200
course this formula is going now to be

678
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,400
our uh head of the

679
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,680
game

680
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,680
because for

681
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,359
example uh

682
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,079
we can Define we can

683
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:35,079
compute the equilibrium composition by

684
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,359
maximizing because the maximum entropy

685
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,359
principle does

686
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,839
apply in

687
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,319
fact that same expression here it's

688
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,400
written more even more formally saying

689
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:02,480
that

690
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:07,119
uh yeah this is the S of the off

691
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,560
system with an N that is now variable

692
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,079
and it depends on the initial amount on

693
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:17,000
the chemical reactions that are in play

694
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:19,960
and on the uh reaction

695
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
coordinate so if you look at it this way

696
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,960
it's going to be easy to do uh the

697
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,720
partial derivatives that we have to do

698
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,040
for example here because for example

699
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,680
with with we like to be we are

700
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,839
interested in taking the derivative of

701
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,839
of the entropy with respect to the

702
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,920
advancement of to the reaction

703
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,920
coordinate of one

704
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,960
reaction because that derivative is

705
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,040
going to be called the Affinity of the

706
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,920
reaction they they don't there uh

707
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,920
Affinity of the

708
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,720
reaction so we have to do that

709
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,839
derivative but before we do that here's

710
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,800
the graphic graph graphical

711
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,680
representation of what we're doing

712
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,760
here for if you fix the value of the

713
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,000
composition so fix an Epsilon say

714
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,760
epsilon

715
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,280
one you you have fixed the composition

716
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,880
and this blue this blue curve represents

717
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,720
the stable equilibrium state of a

718
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,720
mixture with that

719
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,400
composition now you change the

720
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,000
composition and here you have another

721
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,520
stable equilibrium State curve and

722
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,520
another

723
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,520
yet

724
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,920
okay these

725
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,599
curves they do not represent all the

726
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,280
states of your system they represents

727
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,920
this family of

728
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,560
States uh Frozen equilibrium stable

729
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,599
equilibrium states that we have chosen

730
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,599
to describe the

731
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,440
properties but this family is Rich

732
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,880
enough that it can uh span

733
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,839
essentially uh all the allowed region of

734
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,440
the energy versus

735
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:12,839
entropy

736
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,839
diagram for the reacting

737
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:21,720
system and certainly these are allowed

738
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:25,839
States so when we want now to

739
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,839
apply the maximum entropy

740
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,280
principle the max maximum entropy

741
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,240
principle says well I fix the value of

742
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,079
the energy I fix the value of the volume

743
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,520
the initial amounts and the reaction and

744
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,520
the stochiometric

745
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,280
coefficients and the stable equilibrium

746
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,720
state of the chemical reacting system is

747
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:52,160
the one that has the highest

748
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:57,599
entropy so you see along this line it

749
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,800
this black line crosses many uh of these

750
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,640
EPS blue

751
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:06,720
curves until it reaches

752
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,760
one which Beyond which there is

753
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,280
nothing and if you do the same at

754
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,680
another level of energy you're going to

755
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,520
highlight this other equilibrium State

756
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,520
and again this

757
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:28,680
one so the envelope the red curve the

758
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,680
envelope of these blue curves

759
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,400
represents the stable equilibrium States

760
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,880
the maximum anthropy so those are the

761
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,280
stable equilibrium states of the

762
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,520
chemically reacting

763
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,040
system so that dotted red curve is the

764
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,000
fundamental relation for the stable

765
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,000
equilibrium uh stable chemical

766
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
equilibrium

767
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:57,359
States whereas these blue

768
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,079
ones represent stable equilibria only if

769
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,079
the reactions are

770
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,880
Frozen

771
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,640
Okay

772
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:17,280
so this derivative is the

773
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,280
affinity and uh now let's uh

774
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:28,319
uh go into a little more details of the

775
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,720
same same

776
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:35,160
graph same definition of

777
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:39,359
affinity what's new here is only a more

778
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,359
explicit expression for this uh red

779
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,000
curve which is a stable equilibrium

780
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,000
State fundamental

781
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,559
relation with the CH with the c in front

782
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,920
which stands for

783
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:56,920
chemical chemical stable equilibrium

784
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,920
States

785
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,359
you see uh uh at each level of energy

786
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,440
there there is one particular Epsilon

787
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:09,440
which we call Epsilon

788
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,720
zero that corresponds to the composition

789
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,319
at chemical

790
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,720
equilibrium and that's the one that

791
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,680
appears

792
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,760
here so the entropy of the red curve the

793
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,599
entropy of of the stable equilibrium

794
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,680
with chemical

795
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,880
included uh

796
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:35,400
has this um shows for example the

797
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,280
dependence on

798
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,880
energy is not only from the original

799
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,880
dependence of the Frozen

800
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,240
equilibrium mixture but it's also

801
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,960
through the Epsilon

802
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,559
zero because as you change the energy

803
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,559
Epsilon zero changes and so energy

804
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,240
influences the the maximum entropy not

805
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,680
only through the properties of

806
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:08,240
regardless the chemical reactions but

807
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,240
also through the composition at chemical

808
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,040
equ all right so that means that when we

809
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,240
need to

810
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,280
compute derivatives for example the

811
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,040
temperature you remember the temperature

812
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,559
is the derivative or actually the

813
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,960
inverse of the temperature is derivative

814
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:27,599
of fundamental relation respect to

815
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,640
energy

816
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,079
well if I have to take this derivative

817
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,920
with respect to energy I have to

818
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:37,480
contribution from here but I have

819
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,480
contributions also from

820
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,520
here the first

821
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,480
one is what would be the temperature if

822
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,480
the reactions were

823
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:55,200
off and these other contribution is a

824
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,000
summation because these are vectors and

825
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,920
so this a summation of over all the

826
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,800
chemical reactions from J that goes for

827
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:08,920
J that goes from one to Z how the

828
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:11,760
derivative of s off uh with respect to

829
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,760
Epsilon in here you could also do it

830
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,599
with respect to n and then with respect

831
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,880
to

832
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:20,400
Epsilon uh times the derivative of EP

833
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,400
with respect to

834
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:27,319
U however

835
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,160
since at chemical

836
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:41,400
equilibrium the entropy is maximum

837
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:45,119
maximum so if the entropy is maximum it

838
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:49,599
means that it's derivative with respect

839
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:52,559
to these variables here must be zero

840
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,680
including this derivative the affinities

841
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:58,520
that is what we call the the condition

842
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,000
for chemical uh equilibrium the

843
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,200
affinities must be equal to

844
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,720
zero and in these

845
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,720
summations this derivative is precisely

846
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,720
that one so it's the

847
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,880
affinity

848
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:18,440
and maximum it's equal to zero so this

849
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,880
summation is a bunch of

850
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,400
zeros and it turns out therefore

851
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,640
that the temperature so the derivative

852
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,680
of the red curve

853
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,440
is equal to the derivative of a blue

854
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,319
curve in other words they have a contact

855
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,760
of first degree they not only they touch

856
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,760
but also they touch with the same

857
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,599
tangent and this is true not only for

858
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,520
temperature but also for pressure and

859
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,520
for the chemical

860
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,559
potentials okay so we have essentially

861
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,079
already said what the condition the

862
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,880
necessary condition for chemical

863
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,800
equilibrium is is that the affinities

864
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,800
must be equal to

865
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,559
zero

866
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,839
okay so now let's compute those

867
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,400
affinities again that's the derivative

868
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:28,440
we were talking about and here is a

869
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,440
summary of what we just said

870
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:38,040
now the derivative of s we of the

871
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,160
off system the off fundamental relation

872
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,160
with respect to n is the chemical

873
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,280
potential divided by the temperature

874
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,280
with the negative sign in

875
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:53,599
front so when I do uh this derivative

876
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:57,680
the result is a weighted sum of the

877
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,800
stochiometric coefficients because here

878
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,160
uh you're taking the derivative with

879
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:08,200
respect to the Epsilon of one reaction J

880
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:11,640
is the label of the reactions and I is

881
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,640
the label of the

882
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,880
components so these are the

883
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:19,559
stochiometric coefficients of the J

884
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,000
reaction for the I

885
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:25,760
component and so it's the weight

886
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,520
sum of the chemical potential divided by

887
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,559
the temperature

888
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,960
that's the

889
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:35,119
Affinity of reaction

890
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:39,559
J now we

891
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:42,960
can uh use the tools that we uh have

892
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,720
already developed in order to uh

893
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,240
describe um chemical potentials of

894
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,280
mixtures because we spent half of the

895
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,960
course on

896
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:58,079
this for example assume an ideal G

897
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,079
Dalton mixture of Ideal gases

898
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,040
off so these are the off allows us to

899
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,799
use anything that we know of the system

900
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,799
without chemical

901
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,400
reactions if we it's remember it's like

902
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,000
the chemical potential of the of the

903
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,480
pure component at T and P plus RT log of

904
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,440
y y being the mole fraction of that

905
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:28,520
component if we want the reference to

906
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,920
the standard pressure p not

907
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:35,040
then here we have to put that integral

908
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:38,720
from P not to P of the partial of new

909
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,960
respect to P which is the specific

910
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,839
volume and for the case of gas this

911
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,920
gives the logarith

912
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,359
contribution okay so we have seen this

913
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,359
several

914
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:56,240
times let's substitute it up here up

915
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,720
here okay so if you put it up there you

916
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,760
will that end up with a a summation of

917
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:07,440
tetric coefficients times this mui mu I

918
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:10,760
double eyes and this summation you may

919
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,559
recognize is the Gibs free energy of

920
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,200
that reaction because you remember that

921
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,839
the chemical potentials of the pure

922
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,760
components are equal to the GBS free

923
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,480
energies of the pure

924
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,280
component and it's the Delta G zero the

925
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,920
zero here it's because we are doing it

926
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,799
at the standard pressure and a function

927
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,280
of temperature all right so from this

928
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:37,240
part from this thing we obtain a

929
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,240
contribution like

930
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,240
that uh

931
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:48,480
from this other

932
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:53,359
one see there is no subscript I here so

933
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:56,760
it goes uh off the summation sign and in

934
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:59,280
the summation sign can remains only the

935
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,640
summation of the stochiometric

936
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,240
coefficient

937
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:07,480
of which we're going to denote as new of

938
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:11,079
J so that's the total stochiometric

939
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:14,720
coefficients of of reaction

940
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:14,720
J and the last

941
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,200
term it's okay

942
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:24,799
RT but the T goes away with the T at the

943
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,040
denominator here and then it's the

944
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,920
summation of

945
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,920
stochiometric Times log of

946
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:39,839
Y okay you can see that you can put

947
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,400
the the preactor of the logarithm inside

948
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:45,920
it becomes an exponent an exponent so

949
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:50,280
this it becomes the summation of log of

950
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,280
Y to the new new

951
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:56,720
subi and then you so you know that the

952
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:59,440
summation of the logarithms is equal to

953
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,480
the logarithm of the

954
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,559
products of the arguments of the

955
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,040
logarithm this is simply a property of

956
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,040
the

957
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,040
logarithms

958
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:15,599
okay all

959
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:19,880
right so that that equation is like that

960
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:23,799
we now in order to sort of get

961
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:27,319
rid of the logarithm we can take the

962
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:30,200
exponential uh so so if you take the

963
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:33,200
exponential of this expression of

964
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,640
Y actually take the exponential of Y

965
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:41,000
divide also by R and change the

966
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:45,960
sign okay so that can comes from

967
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,839
here uh the exponential of the

968
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,920
logarithm they cancel each other so I'm

969
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:52,599
left with this product of the mole

970
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,799
fractions to the power of the

971
00:52:52,599 --> 00:53:00,200
corresponding stochiometric coefficients

972
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:04,400
and then I have the exponential of this

973
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:06,520
Delta G which is divided by T and also

974
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,480
by R because we divided also by R and

975
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,920
change

976
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:13,359
sign all right we call that exponential

977
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,880
it's actually written

978
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:19,200
here the equilibrium

979
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,839
constant of the

980
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,920
reaction um yeah here I should also

981
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:29,520
correct it should be for precision it

982
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:35,280
should be K Sub sub J now it's the it's

983
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:37,119
related to uh the J uh label of the

984
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,480
chemical reaction so this is the

985
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,960
chemical reaction constant e to the

986
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,799
minus the GS three energy over

987
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:50,040
RT

988
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:53,480
from uh this term here the log of P the

989
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:56,720
log is gone away and the coefficient

990
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,760
multiplying the log was the total so

991
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,559
coefficient which goes inside the

992
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:06,520
logarithm becomes an exponent

993
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:09,359
okay and the product of this pressure

994
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:12,520
dependent and temperature dependent is

995
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:14,720
also called equilibrium constant so

996
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,119
these are really not constants because

997
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,960
they depend on temperature they depend

998
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:20,640
on pressure what they don't depend on is

999
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,040
composition that's why it's they're

1000
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,040
called in traditionally equilibrium

1001
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,040
constants

1002
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,119
so so far we have made no other

1003
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,960
assumption that than the modeling

1004
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:41,480
assumption so this is not yet the

1005
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,480
equilibrium uh law of mass

1006
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,440
action so we call it the non-e

1007
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:51,920
equilibrium low mass

1008
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,920
action it relates this that and that but

1009
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,200
of course since we know that at

1010
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:01,520
equilibrium the the affini are equal to

1011
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,640
zero and so e to the 0 is one so this

1012
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,880
take if you cancel this you have the

1013
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,880
equilibrium law of mass

1014
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:16,480
action here since we've always work with

1015
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:20,960
mole fractions the Y sub eyes it's

1016
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:24,640
written in the most natural way for uh

1017
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,839
for our treatment so

1018
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,880
far often

1019
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:31,799
in the practice of U

1020
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,359
chemical

1021
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:38,520
engineering instead of mole fraction one

1022
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:41,200
uses the

1023
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,319
uh um

1024
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:47,000
concentrations the molar concentration

1025
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:51,039
so the number of molecules per unit

1026
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,119
volume and sometimes you denote that by

1027
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:56,720
c c

1028
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:59,720
Sai concentration

1029
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,119
sometimes you denote it by this n in

1030
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,119
square

1031
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,599
brackets of course there is they

1032
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:12,039
related and therefore if you if you take

1033
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,640
this one and do this substitution you

1034
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:17,839
get the law of mass action written in

1035
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:22,960
terms of

1036
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:25,799
concentrations what changes is uh the

1037
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,160
constants so for example the pressure

1038
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:34,480
depend then goes

1039
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:38,440
away the P you see the P the total P

1040
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:41,079
disappeared and uh so this equilibrium

1041
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,480
constant based on concentration the the

1042
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:46,599
C up there is there just to distinguish

1043
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,520
between these equilibrium constants so

1044
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:50,559
you have to be careful when you are in

1045
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:54,079
this business to understand which

1046
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:57,200
equilibrium constant you're talking

1047
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,960
about there is also this

1048
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,880
last way of writing it also has an

1049
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:07,119
additional difficulty that has to do

1050
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:11,960
with the dimensions because

1051
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:13,880
whereas the top one is

1052
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,359
dimensionless because the M fractions

1053
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,119
are

1054
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:20,839
dimensionless p over p is

1055
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:22,119
dimensionless and Delta G over RT is

1056
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:25,400
dimensionless so everything is

1057
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:28,039
dimensionless up here down here it's not

1058
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:32,079
because this is n over

1059
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:36,079
V and so these equilibrium

1060
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:38,520
constants depend for example this is a

1061
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,520
this is

1062
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:46,160
a these as dimensions

1063
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:51,160
of moles per cubic

1064
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:53,359
meter so if your chemical reaction has

1065
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:57,000
the stochiometric coefficients that are

1066
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:59,079
equal that sum up to zero then this is

1067
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,039
dimensionless but if they don't sum up

1068
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:05,799
to zero then these as Dimensions that

1069
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:08,880
depend on the sum of the tetric

1070
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:13,960
coefficients so that sometimes it's a

1071
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,960
cause of little errors in

1072
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:20,559
computations

1073
00:58:23,319 --> 00:58:31,039
clearly you can redo

1074
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:35,000
what we've just done also for

1075
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:37,240
liquids if you instead of having a the

1076
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,880
reaction occurring in the gasos phase

1077
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:44,039
you have it in the liquid phase and you

1078
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:47,359
can assume ideal Solutions solution at

1079
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:50,119
all compositions for all

1080
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:52,559
components which is rare but it's a

1081
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:55,200
starting

1082
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,920
point then of course you remember that

1083
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,000
integral when you write the chemical

1084
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:03,520
potential instead of the RT log of the p

1085
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,400
over P it's simply P minus P times the

1086
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,400
specific volume of the pure component

1087
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,000
liquid the pure liquid component

1088
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,799
I then you substitute up there then it

1089
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:21,440
appears also the weighted sum of the

1090
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:24,440
volumes that's the volume of the

1091
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,440
reaction

1092
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:32,599
and U when you

1093
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:34,319
do so when you go back here the non

1094
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:39,000
equilibrium law of mass

1095
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:43,000
action this side has the same uh format

1096
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:47,319
except that the equilibrium constant uh

1097
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,720
is different it has also it has one

1098
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:53,000
contribution which Remains the Delta G

1099
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:56,880
over RT that's the equilibrium constant

1100
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,559
k k of JT

1101
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,319
what what differs is that the other

1102
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:03,920
thing that you could also separate and

1103
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:06,119
make it two separate exponentials like

1104
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,640
uh this could be the

1105
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:12,559
preactor of the uh of the standard

1106
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:16,640
equilibrium con constant and you can

1107
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:20,280
also write it in terms of uh

1108
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:22,599
concentrations for a liquid of

1109
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,480
course uh the

1110
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:27,200
concentrations

1111
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,799
uh the relation between Mo fractions and

1112
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:33,799
concentrations are this

1113
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:36,079
way and

1114
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:38,000
again by

1115
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,119
setting

1116
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,079
all the affinities equal to zero your

1117
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,520
system is at equilibrium chemical

1118
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:49,000
equilibrium all the reactions have zero

1119
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:53,640
Affinity at equilibrium so you can set

1120
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,200
zero all these ones and with this law of

1121
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,920
mass action you can compute the

1122
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,920
equilibrium compon

1123
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,640
position if instead of

1124
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:12,839
having

1125
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:16,160
ideal um M gas mixtures or Solutions you

1126
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:20,200
have a uh

1127
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,760
real uh mixtures that you

1128
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:28,079
model according

1129
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:30,280
to Mar goues van are all those models

1130
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:34,039
that we have introduced for the models

1131
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:37,039
of nonideal behavior of

1132
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:37,039
mixtures

1133
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,079
then you can always put that um the

1134
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,640
expression for the chemical potential in

1135
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:48,440
this way in

1136
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:51,839
terms of the

1137
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:55,319
affinities which which become Mo play

1138
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:57,240
the same role as M fra fractions for the

1139
01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:01,359
uh ideal

1140
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:05,039
Behavior instead of calling it yabi you

1141
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:07,520
call it aabi and it becomes non ideal

1142
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:12,440
but the mathematical steps are exactly

1143
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:12,440
the same so here is what you

1144
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:20,119
obtain uh but then obviously you need to

1145
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:23,400
know to have those van or marulas or

1146
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:26,200
whatever relations that allow you to

1147
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,440
write the affinities in terms of mole

1148
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,799
fractions and then this will be a set of

1149
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,200
equations that will allow you to compute

1150
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,200
the mole

1151
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:44,559
fractions now the main part of the

1152
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:47,200
equilibrium constant that exponential of

1153
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:51,240
minus Delta G /

1154
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,240
RT is something that

1155
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:59,920
we have uh already encountered at the

1156
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:03,880
beginning of uh last

1157
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:09,200
lecture when we talked about

1158
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:13,160
the the the role of the Gibs free energy

1159
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,680
in determining when a reaction is react

1160
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:19,680
reactant favored or product

1161
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:23,520
favored because it turned out that

1162
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:29,240
the uh entropy produced by

1163
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,240
irreversibility is related to

1164
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,640
this okay so if I take this expression

1165
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,440
and take the logarithm and actually take

1166
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,440
the logarithm in base

1167
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:46,160
10 I can plot that

1168
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,160
logarithm versus the inverse of the

1169
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:55,279
temperature and we already proved last

1170
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,799
time that this derivative with respect

1171
01:03:55,279 --> 01:04:02,359
of this logarithm with respect to 1 / T

1172
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:04,039
is related to the enthalpy the Nega is

1173
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:08,480
the the negative of the enthalpy of

1174
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:12,960
reaction so when a reaction is

1175
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:15,839
exothermic Delta H is negative so that

1176
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:19,599
means that this slope is positive for

1177
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:23,480
the exothermic reactions so for example

1178
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:25,880
this reaction is exothermic this one is

1179
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,160
endothermic because it goes down with 1

1180
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,160
/

1181
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:35,520
T so you see that the

1182
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,520
chemical equilibrium

1183
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,650
constants

1184
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:44,319
span over a wide range

1185
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:47,920
[Music]

1186
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,920
of of

1187
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:56,559
um how do you

1188
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:58,440
say the senior moment uh uh orders of

1189
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:02,319
magnitude okay

1190
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:06,920
thanks um so you

1191
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:08,720
see so it can go from from very high to

1192
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:12,400
very

1193
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:14,720
small and the reaction in equilibrium

1194
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,000
constant is what

1195
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,119
determines uh the

1196
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,960
compositions if it is very much so if

1197
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:26,319
the equilibrium is very much uh towards

1198
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:30,960
the products

1199
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:34,400
when the chemical equilibrium is uh if

1200
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,480
you go back here if the equilibrium

1201
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,480
constant is

1202
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:47,319
large uh it will make uh uh Prevail the

1203
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:49,279
um the mole fractions that have positive

1204
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:52,799
stochiometric coefficients so it will

1205
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:55,319
make Prevail the uh products whereas if

1206
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:58,920
it is small it will make Prevail the one

1207
01:05:55,319 --> 01:06:03,279
that are at the denominator so they have

1208
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,279
negative stochiometric

1209
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:12,799
coefficient so what how do we how do we

1210
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,799
compute the equilibrium

1211
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:23,079
constants yeah they are

1212
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,880
defined for each reaction but since they

1213
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:27,559
related to the Gibs free energy of

1214
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,559
reaction

1215
01:06:28,839 --> 01:06:34,039
we

1216
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:36,279
can uh use the S relation that you

1217
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:38,119
remember allows you to compute the

1218
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:42,760
properties of reaction from the

1219
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:42,760
properties of formations of your

1220
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:50,400
constituents so all you know all you

1221
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:53,559
need to know is uh the properties of

1222
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:56,200
formation but you need to know them as a

1223
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:57,359
function of temperature

1224
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,000
so for

1225
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:02,359
each component in principle you should

1226
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,960
know you should measure it as a function

1227
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:06,559
of temperature however there's a

1228
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,640
simplifica

1229
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:15,240
So based just on that turns out

1230
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:18,359
that the equilibrium constant for your

1231
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:21,760
reaction can be computed as the

1232
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:23,960
product of the equilibrium constants of

1233
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,079
the reactions of formations of your

1234
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:29,119
various constituents that that appear in

1235
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:33,039
the chemical reaction mechanism to the

1236
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:35,880
power uh of the stochiometric respective

1237
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,880
stric

1238
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,400
coefficients okay and this is

1239
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:45,559
General

1240
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:48,799
now if we use that derivative that we

1241
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:51,160
done in the previous slide and also

1242
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:53,880
earlier to show that this derivative is

1243
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:56,359
equal to the minus of the enpy of

1244
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,680
reaction and then if we know notice that

1245
01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:03,480
the enthalpy of

1246
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:06,920
reaction seems to be pretty constant

1247
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:09,359
with temperature how how how do I why do

1248
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,400
I say that because if you look at these

1249
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:14,839
uh curves here they look like almost

1250
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,839
straight

1251
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:22,199
lines so straight lines means that the

1252
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:25,920
slope is almost

1253
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:26,960
constant so if you assume if you make

1254
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,359
that

1255
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:32,520
approximation if you look close it

1256
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:35,000
they're not literally uh straight

1257
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,839
lines so it is an

1258
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,880
approximation but if you make that

1259
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:42,359
approximation it means you can do can do

1260
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,359
this integral you assume this is

1261
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:48,440
constant and and that integral therefore

1262
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:52,279
it's like an integrate integrate of D of

1263
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:55,679
one / T it's uh it's like a linear

1264
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:58,600
relation between the logarithm of of KT

1265
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,560
and one / T these are exactly the

1266
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:04,080
equation of those line lines of the

1267
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:08,880
previous

1268
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:12,040
plot then if you notice that this one is

1269
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,199
still the the concept of integration is

1270
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:17,319
the equilibrium constant evaluated at

1271
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:22,319
standard temperature and so that's also

1272
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:24,040
related to Delta G over uh I think

1273
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,239
there's a t missing here this is should

1274
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,239
be rt0

1275
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:35,279
and U yeah I have to correct that so if

1276
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:39,159
you substitute that up here and remember

1277
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:42,319
that Delta G is Delta H minus t Delta

1278
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:46,040
s you finally get this expression which

1279
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:48,960
gives the logarithm of KT as a linear

1280
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,960
relation in one /

1281
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:59,640
T and those Delta s and Delta H are the

1282
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:02,719
properties of reaction at standard

1283
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,719
conditions of temperature and

1284
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:10,080
pressure so essentially by just

1285
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,719
knowing the entropies the entropies of

1286
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,840
formation and the enalis of formation of

1287
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,679
your virus

1288
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,840
constituents this expression gives you

1289
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,840
the chemical equilibrium constant at any

1290
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,840
temperature

1291
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,719
and if you if you want to correct for

1292
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,120
that

1293
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:36,400
minor uh difference that is due to the

1294
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:39,960
fact that those lines are not exactly

1295
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:42,600
straight lines but you want to do the

1296
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:45,679
approximation instead of using those you

1297
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,760
can use those from a table which does a

1298
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:54,840
at least square feet which does a better

1299
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:57,760
job for example this table uh gives you

1300
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,880
good numbers in a wide range of

1301
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,480
temperatur from 300 to

1302
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:05,920
5,000k which is

1303
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:09,199
plenty uh what you need uh for for

1304
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:11,560
example combustion

1305
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:13,920
applications all right so we know the

1306
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:17,960
the chemical equilibrium

1307
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,960
constant so let me give you an

1308
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:25,440
example you've probably seen these kind

1309
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:28,400
of things in the previous course 2452 I

1310
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,400
mean two um

1311
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,239
242 in any case suppose we

1312
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,239
consider the reaction of dissociation of

1313
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:40,600
CO2 which is important in combustion

1314
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:44,320
because CO2 is a product of combustion

1315
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:47,000
and at high temperatures uh this

1316
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:50,080
dissociation may occur so let's assume

1317
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,920
the temperature is of the is three

1318
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,920
3200k and that we are at atmospheric

1319
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:03,840
somehow using the previous um U table

1320
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,600
you can compute the equilibrium

1321
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,199
constant

1322
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,199
um which is

1323
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:17,960
64 and so in order to do the calculation

1324
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:19,800
we need to apply the law of mass action

1325
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,760
and the law of mass action says that the

1326
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,360
product of a mole fractions to the

1327
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,320
stochiometric

1328
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:27,199
coefficients it must be equal to to

1329
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,280
equilibrium

1330
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,400
constant the equilibrium constant that

1331
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,560
depends on temperature and

1332
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:38,080
pressure uh now in this case the

1333
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,040
pressure is is equal to P not so this

1334
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:44,000
preactor

1335
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:46,440
uh is equal to one so it cancels out so

1336
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,159
you're left with K of T which is e to

1337
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:53,400
the minus Delta g/ RT okay so we know

1338
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:56,360
the value of the right hand side now for

1339
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:59,000
the left hand side

1340
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,520
we need to express we need to find the

1341
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,120
mole fractions and the mole fractions

1342
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,320
they're not all independent of of one

1343
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:10,560
another because they are

1344
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:14,199
related through the proportionality

1345
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:17,760
relations so Mo fraction is n over total

1346
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:19,960
n so n of component I is equal to the

1347
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,760
initial amount plus the stochiometric

1348
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:25,719
coefficient times the reaction

1349
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,360
coordinate Epsilon

1350
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:31,120
and the denominator is the sum of the

1351
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:33,280
numerators so to speak uh so it's the

1352
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:37,800
total n initial the total stum

1353
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:42,880
coefficient and the uh reaction

1354
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:45,400
coordinate if we divide by N Sub

1355
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:48,199
a denominator and

1356
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:51,639
numerator above I get the mole fractions

1357
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:57,600
the initial mole fractions below I get

1358
01:13:51,639 --> 01:14:01,440
one and Epsilon over n sub a I call it

1359
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,440
C okay so each Mo

1360
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:09,639
fraction depends on the initial mole

1361
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:13,800
fractions and on a

1362
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:16,679
single variable

1363
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,800
C so if I substitute that in the low of

1364
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:20,960
mass

1365
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:23,000
action this gives us one equation in the

1366
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,920
single variable

1367
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,600
C and therefore I can solve for

1368
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,920
C given the initial compositions and

1369
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:37,520
theal composition for this problem is

1370
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:37,520
given somewhere uh here can look up the

1371
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:44,920
details so once I know C I go back here

1372
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,960
and I have the entire composition so I

1373
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,400
have the M fractions of all the various

1374
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:53,040
constituents so that how that's how you

1375
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:57,000
compute chemical equilibrium uh

1376
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:57,000
compositions using Mo fraction

1377
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,560
clearly if you have more than one

1378
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:06,880
reaction in

1379
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:08,719
play you have one law of mass

1380
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:12,440
action per

1381
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:15,760
reaction so each reaction brings in a

1382
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:18,360
new unknown which is the reaction

1383
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,000
coordinate so if you have three

1384
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:23,920
reactions or five say for the example

1385
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,239
that will follow we have five reactions

1386
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:30,120
so you have five know which are

1387
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:33,239
the uh reaction coordinates epsilons or

1388
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,679
the CES which

1389
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:37,480
are the per

1390
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:41,840
mole

1391
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:45,440
coordinates uh five unknown but you have

1392
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:48,719
five equations which are the the

1393
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:51,840
corresponding to setting equal to zero

1394
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:55,560
the five um

1395
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,960
affinities of each of the reactions

1396
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,679
so of course you have to compute five

1397
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,239
chemical equilibrium constants but then

1398
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,800
you have a system of five equations in

1399
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:07,080
five unknowns which gives you uh all uh

1400
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,080
that you

1401
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,360
need this is for

1402
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,320
example I think we we' have seen already

1403
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,480
part of this table when we did a diotic

1404
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:22,040
flame temperature for an internal

1405
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:25,600
combustion

1406
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:27,880
engine so here is the is that

1407
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:33,280
computation that

1408
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:35,760
does at the same time it computes

1409
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:38,560
the uh the energy

1410
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,000
balance that gives you the adiabatic

1411
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,560
flame

1412
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,880
temperature in terms uh but

1413
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,040
also at the same time it you compute the

1414
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,280
five

1415
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:55,920
equilibrium low of mass

1416
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:58,920
actions and therefore as a result you

1417
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,880
can compute the compositions of all the

1418
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,880
various

1419
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:10,000
components notice that these numbers

1420
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,760
this is in mole this is in Mill moles

1421
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,880
and this is in

1422
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:20,120
micromoles uh turns out that U the first

1423
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:23,080
two reactions here the dissociation

1424
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:26,719
reactions are important in

1425
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,520
determining um the thermal aspects of

1426
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,480
the

1427
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,480
combustion they will affect the thetic

1428
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:35,159
flame temp flame temperature if you

1429
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,920
don't consider them you overestimate

1430
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:41,600
it

1431
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:45,239
whereas the last three um give you an

1432
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:50,520
estimate of the uh formation of

1433
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:53,159
the nitrogen oxides that are pollutants

1434
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:56,760
as you know uh of combustion of

1435
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:56,760
combustion products

1436
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:06,040
that correspond to various ways in

1437
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:09,960
which nitrogen and oxygen molecules can

1438
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:11,880
Collide and at high temperatures and uh

1439
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,600
combine to

1440
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,600
form these various

1441
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:25,920
oxides now I told you that um

1442
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:34,120
uh life is not that uh

1443
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,120
simple I

1444
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:42,480
remember collaborator of Professor kek

1445
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:46,280
downstairs who used to say that uh what

1446
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:49,880
I just told you so far is Disneyland

1447
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:54,880
with respect to the real world

1448
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:57,560
because even for the simplest uh uh Hy

1449
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,560
carbon which is

1450
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:06,440
hydrogen in order to describe the

1451
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:09,800
chemical reactions in play and these

1452
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:12,960
activated complexes and so on you

1453
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:16,320
need this is the official scheme 24

1454
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:19,000
reactions and eight

1455
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,840
species and these are the parameters

1456
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,840
that allow you to compute the reaction

1457
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:29,280
rates this is a diagram

1458
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,199
which shows for

1459
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:36,440
various hydrocarbons for example ISO

1460
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:39,679
octane which is like gasoline say you're

1461
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,679
here methane is

1462
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:46,679
here uh and it it gives you in a log

1463
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:49,000
scale the number of species that are

1464
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:51,199
that you need to consider and the number

1465
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,199
of

1466
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:57,600
reactions turns out that the number of

1467
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:01,080
reactions is time is about five times

1468
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:06,719
this straight line is an equation uh it

1469
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:08,960
says that I need five times the number

1470
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,960
of

1471
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:17,679
species hydrogen is really a bit of an

1472
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:20,360
exception because uh 5 by 8 is not 24

1473
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:23,280
but uh in any case hydrogen would be

1474
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:26,120
here in the skin uh and you see for

1475
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:30,000
example for a uh

1476
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:32,960
methane I think you need the

1477
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,360
um yeah 50

1478
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,480
something um species we could read it

1479
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,480
here and

1480
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,480
350

1481
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:47,800
reactions at least this is for is true

1482
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,800
for kinetics whereas for

1483
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:56,080
equilibrium uh we can avoid this kind of

1484
01:20:53,480 --> 01:21:00,080
complication but but for the

1485
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:03,199
kinetics it's not so simple actually if

1486
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,400
you look up uh even this is not a

1487
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:07,199
settled uh issue because people are

1488
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,800
still working on determining these

1489
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:13,159
detail mechanisms for new fuels but also

1490
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:16,920
for old fuels and now uh there is a lot

1491
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:19,320
of uh the artificial intelligence is is

1492
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,760
playing a game also here because

1493
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:25,480
developing these schemes with so many

1494
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:30,480
reactions is first of all

1495
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:33,199
complicated second it makes life uh

1496
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:36,199
uh

1497
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,199
very

1498
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:44,880
uh difficult because you how do you know

1499
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:49,520
first of all if I have 5,000 uh

1500
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:52,719
reactions to be considered how do I know

1501
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:58,320
that the 5,000 parameters that that

1502
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:58,320
Define the reaction right Ates are are

1503
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:08,000
correct uh

1504
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,000
and and what if are they all

1505
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:14,280
important so in fact many people are

1506
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:19,560
working on uh and artificial

1507
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:23,320
intelligence may help in model reduction

1508
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:26,600
schemes so you say you start with the

1509
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:30,480
complete uh scheme but then you you try

1510
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:33,280
to cut out at least for ranges of

1511
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:36,600
conditions and do a simplif simplified

1512
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:43,000
model that allows you to to do a good

1513
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:45,920
job anyway so uh a lot of and again

1514
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:50,239
mentioned Professor kek because he was

1515
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:53,159
one great contributor uh to this issue

1516
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:56,520
through the rate controlled constrained

1517
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:58,560
equilibrium method that uh you might if

1518
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,880
you're interested you should uh should

1519
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,880
read

1520
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:10,560
about okay now so the affinities at

1521
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:14,080
equilibrium are equal to

1522
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:16,480
zero uh here is a another way of of

1523
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,480
saying

1524
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,920
it which gives us a

1525
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:29,280
chance know I should say a again or

1526
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,880
first chance to use the method of lrange

1527
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,280
multipliers for maximizing

1528
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,199
functions subject to

1529
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,239
constraints because after all the

1530
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:42,600
chemical equilibrium condition comes as

1531
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:44,880
a condition uh from the maximization of

1532
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,880
the

1533
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:51,600
entropy of the entropy of our uh system

1534
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:54,600
with chemical reactions so therefore

1535
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:57,520
this is the we adopt this model model

1536
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,520
for describing its

1537
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:04,760
entropy where the N the

1538
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:12,360
amounts uh can be varied but only in a

1539
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:15,560
constrained way constrained by the

1540
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:18,159
proportionality relations so we

1541
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:20,280
consider maximize this

1542
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:24,440
function

1543
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:27,440
subject to keeping energy volume initial

1544
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:31,199
amounts stomri coefficients fixed and

1545
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:33,320
varing the constituents only according

1546
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:36,400
to these equations so this is a

1547
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:39,600
constrained maximization

1548
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:42,679
problem and as you may

1549
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,520
know I'm sure you've seen it somewhere

1550
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:47,360
else

1551
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:50,040
uh

1552
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:53,400
um the method of lrange multipliers

1553
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:55,639
consists in taking the the function you

1554
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:59,360
want to maximize and

1555
01:24:55,639 --> 01:25:03,239
subtracting uh uh the constraints each

1556
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:05,800
one multiplied by its own undetermined

1557
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:08,800
parameter

1558
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,679
Lambda and so I write the constraint

1559
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,639
constraint by putting everything on one

1560
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:15,480
side and setting it to zero and that

1561
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:19,239
that thing on the one side is the thing

1562
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:21,800
that is multiplied by the lrange

1563
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:25,000
multiplier so now I have a

1564
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:28,719
function in which I have the R

1565
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:33,520
multipliers I have the N I have the

1566
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:36,119
epsilons and I want to maximize this uh

1567
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:38,440
function so essentially need to take the

1568
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:40,960
derivative with respect and set it equal

1569
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:42,320
to zero with respect to those the

1570
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,920
derivative with respect to those

1571
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:48,040
variables that

1572
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,040
are um

1573
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:53,840
undetermined so the n and the Epsilon so

1574
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,239
I take the derivative of L with respect

1575
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,239
to n

1576
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:05,960
so uh I get one contribution

1577
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:08,600
from s from the entropy the derivative

1578
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:12,560
of s with respect to n this is equal to

1579
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:14,760
the minus of the St of the minus equal

1580
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,840
potential over the

1581
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,480
temperature and then when I take the

1582
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,719
derivative with respect to N I also have

1583
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:22,119
a contribution from here because this is

1584
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,719
an

1585
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:27,880
N which is minus Lambda and that's this

1586
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:30,760
minus Lambda

1587
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:34,639
here this has to be set to be equal to

1588
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:38,040
zero for this Max this lran function to

1589
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:40,400
be unconstrained maximum so apply the

1590
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:43,159
rules of maximizing function so you set

1591
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:45,719
the derivative is equal to

1592
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:49,000
zero so this

1593
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:52,040
says Ah okay the lrange multiplier must

1594
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,400
be equal to uh the chemical potential

1595
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:57,280
over T fine

1596
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,320
then I take the derivative of L with

1597
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,320
respect to

1598
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,639
Epsilon okay I pick up nothing from here

1599
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:09,480
because the Epsilon doesn't appear here

1600
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:13,440
Epsilon is only

1601
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:16,800
there so it it's with a plus because

1602
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:18,600
there's two minuses here and the Epsilon

1603
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:25,639
J picks

1604
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:28,480
up uh the stochiometric coefficients of

1605
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:31,960
uh of the J

1606
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:35,560
reaction multiplied by the lrange

1607
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:38,880
multipliers so this is what we get but

1608
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,920
since the LR multipliers is minus mu / T

1609
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,600
we can

1610
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,560
substitute and

1611
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:49,400
that is the expression of what we called

1612
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:51,840
the Affinity of the

1613
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:54,239
reaction and taking the derivative equal

1614
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:58,280
to zero and therefore imposes the

1615
01:27:54,239 --> 01:28:01,080
Affinity to be equal to zero okay so

1616
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:04,280
just another way of deriving the

1617
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,280
chemical equilibrium

1618
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:13,960
conditions however this is useful also

1619
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,960
to introduce

1620
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:20,199
another

1621
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:22,679
possibility precisely

1622
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:26,679
because we have so

1623
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:28,480
many chemical reactions and and chemical

1624
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:30,119
species in

1625
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:33,119
play

1626
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:36,920
uh maybe we can

1627
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:41,000
also uh work and people do work in fact

1628
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:42,760
uh uh in all the simulation softwares

1629
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,840
commercial softwares that have

1630
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:47,400
properties for uh

1631
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,159
Computing

1632
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:52,440
equilibrium uh they are based on this

1633
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:55,600
concept of complete chemical equilibrium

1634
01:28:52,440 --> 01:29:00,040
what what is it

1635
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:03,320
the idea is all right why should I

1636
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:07,080
list uh such a large number of reactions

1637
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:09,159
couldn't just just say that uh all

1638
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:11,639
reactions are

1639
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:13,920
possible all conceivable

1640
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:15,440
reactions so instead of listing the

1641
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,600
reactions let's assume that all

1642
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:21,159
conceivable reactions are possible in

1643
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,159
order to compute chemical

1644
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,840
equ so what would be the only constraint

1645
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:28,199
in chemical

1646
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:31,040
reactions chemical reactions the only

1647
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:34,159
thing that they cannot do is to change

1648
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:36,320
the nuclei so the inventory of nuclei in

1649
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:41,199
your mixture is

1650
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:45,320
fixed so the constraints here is count

1651
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:49,840
the number of nuclei in your mixture

1652
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:52,440
initial you you must be sure that they

1653
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:55,960
remain what they were otherwise you

1654
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:58,080
would be doing nuclear uh

1655
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:02,600
equilibrium

1656
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:04,719
okay so the idea is uh you want to

1657
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:06,400
maximize is usually the entropy because

1658
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,920
we are applying the maximum entropy

1659
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:13,280
principle now the constraint is that I

1660
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:15,040
want to con constraint the this c subk c

1661
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:20,719
is the

1662
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:24,480
number of uh nuclei of a given

1663
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:27,280
type and they are given

1664
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:30,320
initially this way and at a generic

1665
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,560
composition this way so what are these

1666
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:37,080
coefficients a sub I

1667
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:43,679
K let me explain it with this table

1668
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:49,520
here a sub by K represents for each uh

1669
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:49,520
for the molecule for example uh I say

1670
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:59,719
methane it gives you the number of of

1671
01:30:54,199 --> 01:31:02,320
nuclei of each type so the first type is

1672
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:05,239
carbon yes in methane there is one

1673
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,440
carbon so I put a one here there are

1674
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:09,960
four

1675
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:12,560
hydrogens so I put a four there are no

1676
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:15,880
oxyg no

1677
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:20,600
nitrogens okay so these are the uh

1678
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:24,400
Matrix of um com nuclear nuclear

1679
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:26,760
composition of the uh of your various

1680
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:29,000
constituents so you list the

1681
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:32,880
constituents and you for each one of

1682
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:35,679
them you put how many nuclei of each

1683
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:41,080
kind there is it turns out that for a

1684
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:43,920
very large number of organic

1685
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:45,360
molecules uh the number of nuclei is

1686
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,679
very

1687
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:52,320
small carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen

1688
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:55,199
what else yeah maybe argon because it's

1689
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:57,600
present in air

1690
01:31:55,199 --> 01:32:00,239
but um

1691
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:03,760
okay so that means

1692
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:06,159
since the index that runs here so the

1693
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:10,040
number of constraints is that you have

1694
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:13,480
is the count of the nuclei in these

1695
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:16,800
columns so you have few

1696
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:20,320
constraints just as many at kinds of

1697
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:23,400
atoms are around

1698
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,360
okay so with the initial composition and

1699
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:28,679
sub a

1700
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:30,320
uh sub a and with this table you compute

1701
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:32,639
how many you have

1702
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,880
initially and you have to make sure by

1703
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:37,719
this maximization constraint

1704
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:40,639
maximization that also at equilibrium

1705
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:43,960
you have that same number

1706
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:47,159
of of of of

1707
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:50,080
nuclei everything else is allowed so

1708
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:52,480
that means you assume that there will be

1709
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,880
some chemical reactions that will do

1710
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:58,560
that change will take you to that

1711
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:00,360
equilibrium because everything is

1712
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:03,760
allowed provided the nuclear

1713
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:07,760
conservation is is done is

1714
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:12,440
satisfied so again to proceed we we we

1715
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:16,360
assign a lrange multiplier to each

1716
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:20,199
constraint and the constraint here uh is

1717
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:25,080
written uh by taking on the same side

1718
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:28,440
here these two so it's n i minus initial

1719
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:31,000
n i * a

1720
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,800
summation and then you multiply each one

1721
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,800
by the L

1722
01:33:34,119 --> 01:33:42,960
multiply and now you take you

1723
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:42,960
impose that this function be

1724
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,320
uh

1725
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,760
maximum so you impose the derivative

1726
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:52,400
equal to

1727
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:56,239
zero with respect to the only variable

1728
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,239
which is the NS the an

1729
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:03,840
subbi so you do

1730
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:06,040
that and of course the this one still

1731
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:11,480
gives you the chemical potential over

1732
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:15,679
the temperature and this uh

1733
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:19,679
here and gives you the summation over K

1734
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:21,320
of Lambda K time a i

1735
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:26,040
k

1736
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:29,480
now for example let's

1737
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:33,159
assume uh ideal gas

1738
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,159
mixture or ideal

1739
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:40,080
Behavior like this chemical potential

1740
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:40,080
goes with the logarithm of

1741
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:47,840
Y so you substitute it up

1742
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:50,239
there and so you obain an equation since

1743
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:53,080
this must be equal to zero you get an

1744
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:55,080
equation that gives you the log of Y in

1745
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,480
terms

1746
01:34:55,080 --> 01:35:01,159
of this chemical potential of the pure

1747
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:02,480
component and this summation of the

1748
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:05,159
lrange

1749
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,320
multipliers times these coefficients of

1750
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:07,320
the

1751
01:35:08,679 --> 01:35:14,320
Matrix so this is the this gives you the

1752
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,480
composition but it is in terms of lrange

1753
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:18,520
multipliers so you need in this case

1754
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,040
four lrange multipliers how do I

1755
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:24,000
determine the lar multipliers as

1756
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:26,800
typically in the method uh you to

1757
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,199
substitute the solution back into the

1758
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:32,639
constraints and that will give you an

1759
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:36,600
equation that allows you to compute the

1760
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:41,000
uh multipliers so I take this

1761
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:43,560
expression and put it here in order to

1762
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:48,560
compute uh

1763
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:52,600
the uh the amount of nuclei that it

1764
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:55,880
implies okay so this is the ends then

1765
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:58,760
the ends can be m can be n n subis can

1766
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,639
be computed as n times the mole

1767
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:03,920
fractions all right so this is an

1768
01:36:01,639 --> 01:36:06,280
equation or actually it's a system of

1769
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,280
four

1770
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:14,360
equations because I know the initial

1771
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:15,920
amounts of the of the nuclei so I know

1772
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:19,840
the left hand

1773
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:23,239
side and the only unknowns are the

1774
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:27,360
um lrange multipliers so I can solve

1775
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:29,480
this four system four by four system

1776
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,320
four equations in four unknowns and get

1777
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:33,800
the lrange multipliers as a function of

1778
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:36,560
the initial composition I plug it back

1779
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,719
here and then I have the mole fractions

1780
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,400
and

1781
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:43,560
notice

1782
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:47,239
that uh it's very interesting

1783
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:49,440
because uh we didn't put any limit to

1784
01:36:47,239 --> 01:36:50,840
the number of chemical compounds that

1785
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:54,159
you can

1786
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:56,040
consider so this L list can be

1787
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:59,239
as long as you

1788
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:04,040
please you could take the entire J of

1789
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:08,679
tables uh or uh you can just consider

1790
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:10,560
the ones that you want and uh and this

1791
01:37:08,679 --> 01:37:12,560
expression will give you the mole

1792
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:15,040
fractions of anything that you're

1793
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,040
interested

1794
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:23,400
in

1795
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:23,400
and this

1796
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:33,000
method was is was implemented by Gordon

1797
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:37,800
and McBride uh in the 50s I believe and

1798
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,159
it is still um the method used um in

1799
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:41,199
almost all

1800
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:45,000
softwares I know it very well because

1801
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:47,599
when I started when I did my masters uh

1802
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:51,880
with Professor

1803
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:54,360
kek uh I worked for one year uh and

1804
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:57,320
those times we didn't have a

1805
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:59,920
uh easy computerss the computer building

1806
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:02,719
was uh like a building uh near the

1807
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,520
nuclear engineering department and uh he

1808
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:06,800
gave

1809
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:10,000
me this computer program was a set of

1810
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:13,760
cards like a thousand or 2,000 cards in

1811
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:18,679
a box for the program something that

1812
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:21,000
today I think stays in like uh maybe

1813
01:38:18,679 --> 01:38:24,040
28k

1814
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:27,000
kilobytes and another box

1815
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:28,960
with the properties of the

1816
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,960
various

1817
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:37,119
constituents and uh and he asked me to

1818
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:39,639
implement his model reduction uh method

1819
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:43,639
constraint equilibrium method into that

1820
01:38:39,639 --> 01:38:46,639
software which was very nice

1821
01:38:43,639 --> 01:38:48,800
start uh here and now I notice also that

1822
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:51,400
there is something I have to correct

1823
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,719
here because is it plus or is it

1824
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:55,960
minus I'll figure it out and let let you

1825
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:58,960
know okay so I think we are done for

1826
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,960
today
