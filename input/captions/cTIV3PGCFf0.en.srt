00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,680
the study and the role that hydrogen

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,759
will play more broadly in decarbonizing

29
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,720

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,640
between gray green and blue

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,560
hydrogen a though hydrogen does not

32
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,000
generate any emissions directly when it

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,600
is used hydrogen production can have a

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
huge environmental impact colors of

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,520
hydrogen are increasingly used used to

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
distinguish different production methods

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,079
and as a proxy to represent the

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,600
associated environmental impact today

39
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,520
close to 95% of hydrogen production

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,240
comes from fossil resources as a result

41
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,920
the carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,920
hydrogen production are quite High gray

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,719
black and brown hydrogen refer to Fossil

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,560
based production gray is the most common

45
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,119
form of production and comes from

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,880
natural gas or methane using steam

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,719
methane Reformation but without

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,039
capturing CO2

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,680
there are two ways to move toward

50
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,680
cleaner hydrogen production one is

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,239
applying carbon capture and storage to

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,959
the fossil fuel-based hydrogen

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,879
production processes natural gas-based

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,519
hydrogen production with carbon capture

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,280
and storage is referred to as blue

56
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,239
hydrogen if substantial amounts of CO2

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,879
from natural gas reforming are captured

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,720
and permanently stored such hydrogen

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,879
could be a low carbon energy carrier the

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,879
second way to produce cleaner hydrogen

61
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,080
is by using electricity to produce Hy

62
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,800
hen via

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,280
electrolysis in this case the source of

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,599
the electricity determines the

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,720
environmental impact of the hydrogen

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,599
with a lowest impact being achieved when

67
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,640
electricity is generated from renewable

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,000
sources such as wind and

69
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,680
solar this is known as green

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,599
hydrogen Q what insights does an LCA

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,280
approach give us when analyzing blue

72
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,560
hydrogen and other low carbon Energy

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,920
Systems a mitigating climate change

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,840
requires significant decarbonization of

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,200
the global economy accurate estimation

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,760
of cumulative greenhouse gas ghg

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,080
emissions and its reduction Pathways is

78
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,120
critical irrespective of the source of

79
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,239
emissions an LCA approach allows the

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,400
quantification of the environmental life

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,599
cycle of a commercial product process or

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,840
in the context of low carbon hydrogen it

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,840
is essential to understand the ghg

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
impact of supply chain options depending

90
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,319
on the production method contribution of

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,319
life cycle stages to the total emissions

92
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,680
might vary for example with natural

93
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,360
gas-based hydrogen production emissions

94
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,640
associated with production and transport

95
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,159
of natural gas might be a significant

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,560
contributor based on its leakage and

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,120
flaring rates if these rates are not

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,959
precisely accounted for the

99
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,079
environmental impact of blue hydrogen

100
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,959
can be

101
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,360
underestimated however the same

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,159
rationale is also true for

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,079
electricity-based hydrogen production if

104
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,159
the electricity is not supplied from low

105
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,439
carbon sources such as wind solar or

106
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,919
nuclear the carbon intensity of hydrogen

107
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,079
can be significantly underestimated in

108
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,639
the case of nuclear there are also other

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,680
environmental impact considerations an

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,040
LCA approach if performed with

111
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,919
consistent system boundaries can provide

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,479
an accurate environmental impact

113
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,560
comparison it should also be noted that

114
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,800
these estimations can only be as good as

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,680
the assumptions and correlations used

116
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,560
unless they're supported by

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,440
measurements Q what conditions are

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,919
needed to make blue hydrogen production

119
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,960
most effective and how can it complement

120
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,280
other decarbonization

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,440
Pathways a hydrogen is considered one of

122
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,199
the key vectors for the decarbonization

123
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,320
of hardto abate sectors such as

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,759
of global hydrogen production is fossil

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,759
fuel based in the next decade massive

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,600
amounts of hydrogen must be produced to

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,840
meet this anticipated demand it is very

130
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,600
hard if not impossible to meet this

131
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,080
demand without leveraging existing

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,320
production assets the immediate and

133
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,440
relatively cost-effective option is to

134
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,199
retrofit existing plants with carbon

environmental impact of blue hydrogen

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,199
may vary over large ranges but depends

138
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,160
on only a few key parameters the methane

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,800

140
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,440

combined with natural gas supply

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,080
featuring low methane emissions

146
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,120
substantially reduces ghg emissions

147
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,960
compared to Conventional natural gas

148
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,199

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,600
