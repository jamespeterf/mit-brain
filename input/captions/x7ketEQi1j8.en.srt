questions Ana Danielson on energy

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,679
education and its role in climate action

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,800
written by Kelly

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,920
Travers the MIT energy initiative Mighty

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
leads energy education in MIT developing

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
and implementing a robust educational

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,679
toolkit for MIT graduate and

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,359
undergraduate students online Learners

10
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,000
around the world and high school

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,680
students who want to contribute to the

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,160
energy transition as mighty's Director

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,000
of Education anre Danielson manages a

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,040
team devoted to training the next

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,640
generation of energy innovators

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,600
entrepreneurs and policy makers here she

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,680
discusses new initiatives in mighty's

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,399
education program and how they're

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,000
preparing students to take an active

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,320
role in climate

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,320
action question what role are mighty's

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,920
education efforts playing in climate

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,600
action initiatives at MIT and what more

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,719
could we be doing answer

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,479
this is a big question the carbon

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,000
emissions from energy are such an

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,560
important factor in climate mitigation

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,759
therefore what we do in energy education

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,200
is practically synonymous with climate

30
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,479
education this is well Illustrated in a

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,159
2018 nature energy paper by fusu narini

32
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,400
which outlines that affordable clean

33
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,720
energy is related to many of the United

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,600
Nations sustainable development goals

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,880
SGS not just sg7 which specifically

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,600
calls for affordable reliable sustain

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,880
sustainable and modern energy for all by

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:41,439
2030 there are 17 SGS containing 169

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,560
targets of which 113 65% require actions

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,399
to be taken concerning Energy

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,159
Systems now can we equate education with

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,399
action the answer is yes but only if it

43
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,560
is done correctly from the behavioral

44
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,079
change literature we know that knowledge

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,159
alone is not enough to change Behavior

46
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,320
so one important part of education

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,920
program is practice and experience

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,439
through research internships stakeholder

49
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,960
engagement and other avenues at a

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,000
minimum education must give the learner

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,760
the knowledge skills and courage to be

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,040
ready to jump into action but ideally

53
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,000
practice is a part of the offering we

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
also want our Learners to go out into

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,760
the world and share what they know and

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,160
do if Done Right education is an energy

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,519
transition accelerator and mighty our

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,599
Learners are not just MIT students we

59
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,200
are creating online offerings based on

60
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,720
residential MIT courses to train Global

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,200
professionals policy makers and students

62
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,360
in research methods and tools to support

63
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,319
and accelerate the energy transition

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,760
these are free and open to Learners

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,879
worldwide we have five courses available

66
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,200
now with more to come our latest program

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,760
is a collaboration with mit's Center for

68
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,959
Energy and environmental policy research

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,560
Seer climate action through education or

70
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,400
Kate this is a teach the teacher program

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,400
for High School curriculum and is a part

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,239
of the MIT climate action plan the aim

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,920
is to develop interdisciplinary

74
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,080
Solutions focused climate change

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,720
curricula for us High School teachers

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,720
with components in history social

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
science English language arts math

78
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,319
science and computer science we are

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,400
rapidly expanding our programming in the

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,360
online space for our Global Learners we

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,519
are bundling courses for professional

82
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,640
development certificates for our

83
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,560
undergraduates we are redesigning the

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,920
energy studies minor to reflect what we

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,159
have learned over the past 12 years and

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,319
for our graduate students we are adding

87
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,000
a new program that allows them to Garner

88
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,840
industry experience related to the

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,319
energy transition meanwhile Kate is

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,560
creating a support network for the

91
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,360
teachers who adopt the curriculum we are

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,239
also working on creating an energy and

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,080
climate alliance with other universities

94
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,879
around the world on The Institute level

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,239
I am a member of the climate education

96
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,640
working group a subgroup of the climate

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,599
nucleus where we discuss and will soon

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,079
recommend further climate action The

99
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,840
Institute can take stay tuned for that

100
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,680
question you mentioned that you were

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,959
leading an effort to create a Consortium

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,200
of energy and climate education programs

103
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,879
at universities around the world how

104
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,560
does this effort fit into mighty's

105
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,159
educational Mission answer yes we are

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,359
currently calling it The energy and

107
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,000
climate education Alliance the

108
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,320
background to this is that the problem

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,360
we are facing transitioning the entire

110
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,800
Global Energy System from high carbon

111
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,880
emissions to low no and negative carbon

112
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,960
emissions is global huge and urgent

113
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,280
following the proverbial many hands make

114
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,080
light work we believe that the success

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,759
of this very complex task is

116
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
accomplished quicker with more

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,240
participants there is of course more to

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
this as well the complexity of the

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,120
problem is such that one MIT doesn't

120
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
have all the expertise needed to

121
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,320
accomplish the educational needs of the

122
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,280
climate and energy

123
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,080
crisis two there is a definite local and

124
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,840
Regional component to capacity building

125
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,560
and three collaborations with

126
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,680
universities around the world will make

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,560
our mission driven work more

128
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,680
efficient finally these collaborations

129
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,800
will be advantageous for our students as

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,280
they'll be able to learn from Real World

131
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,919
case studies that are not us-based and

132
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,759
maybe even visit other universities

133
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,800
abroad do internships and engage in

134
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,400
collaborative research projects also

135
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,680
students from those universities will be

136
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,400
able to come here and experience mit's

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
unique intellectual environment right

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
now we are very much in the beginning

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,280
stages of creating the alliance we have

140
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,960
signed a collaboration agreement with

141
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,280
the Technical University of Berlin

142
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,400
Germany and are engaged in talks with

143
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,560
other European and Southeast Asian

144
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,000
universities some of the collaborations

145
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,039
we're envisioning relate to course

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
development student exchange

147
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,199
collaborative research and course

148
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,639
promotion we are very excited about this

149
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,520
collaboration it fits well into mit's

150
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,600
ambition to take climate action outside

151
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,400
of the University while still staying

152
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,160
within our educational

153
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
Mission question it is clear to me from

154
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,720
this conversation that mighty's

155
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,600
education program is undertaking a

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,400
number of initiatives to prepare MIT

157
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,400
students and interested Learners outside

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,199
of the Institute to take an active role

159
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,840
in climate action but the reality is

160
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,400
that despite our rapidly changing

161
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,840
climate and the immediate need to

162
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,840
decarbonize our global economy climate

163
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,680
denialism and a lack of climate and

164
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,039
energy understanding persist in the

165
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,960
greater global population what do you

166
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
think must be done and what can Mighty

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,039
do to increase climate and energy

168
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,720
literacy

169
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,240
broadly answer I think the basic problem

170
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,039
is not necessarily a lack of

171
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,840
understanding but an abundance of

172
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,840
competing issues the people are dealing

173
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,840
with every day poverty personal health

174
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,360
unemployment inflation pandemics housing

175
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,759
Wars all are very immediate problems

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,360
people have and climate change perceive

177
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,080
to be in the future the United States is

178
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,360
a very bottom-up country where

179
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
corporations offer what people buy and

180
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,879
politicians advocate for what voters

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,360
want and what money buys of course this

182
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,000
is overly simplified but as long as we

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,840
don't don't come up with mechanisms to

184
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,879
achieve a Monumental shift in consumer

185
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,120
and voter Behavior we are up against

186
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,360
these immediate

187
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,520
pressures however we are seeing some

188
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,000
movement in this area due to Rising gas

189
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,720
and heating oil prices and the many

190
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,759
natural disasters we are encountering

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
now people are starting to understand

192
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,000
that climate change will hit their

193
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,919
pocketbook whether or not we have a

194
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,800
carbon tax the recent Florida hurricane

195
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,120
damage wildfires in the west extreme

196
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,080
summer temperatures frequent droughts

197
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,440
increasing numbers of poison pois and

198
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,039
disease carrying insects they all

199
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,199
illustrate the relationship between

200
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,520
climate change health and financial

201
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,360
damage fewer and fewer people will be

202
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,080
able to deny the existence of climate

203
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,840
change because they will either be

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,680
directly affected or know someone who is

205
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,000
the question is one of speed and scale

206
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,639
the more we can help to make the

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,840
connections even more visible and

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,479
understood the faster we get to the

209
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,560
general acceptance that this is real

210
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,919
research projects like seer's Roosevelt

211
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,800
project which develops action plans to

212
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,479
help communities deal with industrial up

213
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,479
people in the context of the energy

214
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,120
transition are contributing to this

215
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,879
effect as our studies related to climate

216
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,960
change and National Security this is a

217
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,240
fast-moving world and our research

218
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,159
findings need to be translated as we

219
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,800
speak a real problem in education is

220
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,599
that we have the tendency to teach the

221
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,800
tried and true our education programs

222
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:27,199
have to become much nimbler which means

223
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,560
curricula have to be updated frequently

224
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,080
and that is expensive and of course of

225
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,000
course the speed and magnitude of our

226
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,959
efforts are dependent on the funding we

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,479
can attract and fundraising for

228
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,760
education is more difficult than

229
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,159
fundraising for

230
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,959
research however let me pivot you

231
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,120
alluded to the fact this is a global

232
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,720
problem the immediate pressures of

233
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,080
poverty and hunger are a matter of

234
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,000
survival in many parts of the world and

235
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,480
when it comes to surviving another day

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,839
who cares if climate change will render

237
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,640
your Fields unproductive in 20 years or

238
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,720
if the weather turns your Homeland into

239
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,120
a lake will you think about lobbying

240
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,040
your government to reduce carbon

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,959
emissions or will you ask for help to

242
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
rebuild your existence on the flip side

243
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,959
politicians and government authorities

244
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,560
in those areas have to deal with

245
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,079
extremely complex situations balancing

246
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,880
local needs with global demands we

247
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,160
should learn from them what we need is

248
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,240
to listen what are those areas of the

249
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,760
world need most and how can climate

250
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
action be included in the calculations

251
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,800
the global commission to end energy

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,519
poverty a collaboration between Mighty

253
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,240
and the Rockefeller Foundation to bring

254
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,399
electricity to the billion people across

255
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,519
the globe Who currently live with

256
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,040
without it is a good example of what we

257
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,000
are already doing both our online

258
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,079
education program and the energy and

259
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,440
climate education Alliance aim to go in

260
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,440
this direction the struggle and

261
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,560
challenge to solve climate change can be

262
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,399
pretty depressing and there are many

263
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,040
days when I feel despondent about the

264
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,079
speed and progress we're making and

265
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,959
saving the future of humanity but the

266
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,279
prospect of contributing to such a large

267
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
Mission even if the Education team can

268
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,200
only nudge us a tiny bit away from the

269
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,120
business's usual scenario is exciting

270
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,680
in particular working on an issue like

271
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,560
this at MIT is amazing so much is

272
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,120
happening here and there don't seem to

273
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,920
be intellectual limits in fact thinking

274
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,399
big is encouraged it is very refreshing

275
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,279
when one has encountered the old you

276
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,880
can't do this too often in the past I

277
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:22,760
want our students to take this attitude

278
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,760
with them and go out there and think big
