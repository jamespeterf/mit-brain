1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,480
right. Uh let's get started. So today

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,279
we're going to continue our discussion

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,439
of you know algebra. Uh so last time we

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,680
talked about modular arithmetic and I

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,240
introduced you to the basic notions. We

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,039
talked about the uklidian algorithm, the

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,000
extended uklidian algorithm and uh

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,239
multiplicative inverses and it turns out

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
that um there are some really powerful

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,879
abstractions that can give us a useful

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
way to think about modular arithmetic

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,200
and these come from really the starting

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,800
point of group theory. So group theory

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,920
is something that you can take you know

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,520
a whole class in multiple classes in and

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
it goes quite deep but we're going to

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
introduce you to the basics of group

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,320
theory and you know why this abstraction

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,280
is powerful. So let me start off from

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,000
where we left off last time. So we had

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,400
this notion of you know multiplication

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,320
in modular arithmetic and one of the

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,560
questions which was on our mind was you

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,280
know whether an element has a

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,840
multiplicative inverse. So given an

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,560
element a is there's some other number

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,240
element we can multiply it by so that

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,560
mod n we get back one and we showed that

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,080
this was always true whenever n is prime

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,400
and a is non zero. And in fact um you

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,680
know what we really showed was that even

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,000
if n is not prime the critical thing is

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,520
whether or not the gcd the greatest

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,439
common divisor between a and n is one.

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,119
So we showed in particular that there

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,560
was this equivalent way to think about

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,680
the gcd as the smallest integer you can

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,439
get nonzero integer where you take you

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,000
know s * a plus t * n and you want to

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,320
get that to be equal to one. So if the

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
gcd is one then that gives you the

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,040
multiplicative inverse and if you can't

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,000
get one you can show directly that it

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,640
has no multiplicative inverse. So this

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,959
is where we left off last time. But now

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm going to tell you one very powerful

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,360
definition and it'll take us you know uh

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,440
all of today's lecture to really

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
understand why this is such a powerful

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,720
notion which takes us to what's called a

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,319
group.

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,080
So a group is just a pair G. It's a set

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:32,480
of elements potentially infinite along

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,360
with a binary operation star. So this is

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,959
some set potentially infinite and this

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,120
is just a binary operation

58
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,440
and the critical thing about a group is

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,160
that it has to satisfy a whole bunch of

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,080
properties. So the first thing we need

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,480
is closure that we can apply this binary

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,280
operation to pairs of elements and get

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,959
back another element in the group. So

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,519
this is really just the statement that

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,599
for any pair of elements AB that belong

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,560
to the group the operation of A* B is

67
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,879
well defined because it sends us back to

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,519
some group element.

69
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,159
Right? So last time when I wrote down

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,400
for example this table we got with

71
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,319
modular addition I was really just

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
showing you for every row that's a

73
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
choice of a different element for every

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,080
column that's a choice of a different

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,560
element. And I told you in the table you

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,599
know what particular group element that

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,720
pair adds to or multiplies to. That was

78
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,720
just the closure property. We also need

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,720
associivity

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,440
which is also familiar from before. So

81
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,360
for all triples a b c that belong to

82
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,159
your group doing the operation of a star

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,120
b and then taking the result and doing

84
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,840
that with star c is the same thing as

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
parenthesizing the expression a

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,360
different way.

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,400
We also need the existence of an

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,400
identity element

90
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,680
which means that there is some element

91
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,599
which we'll call E that belongs to the

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:20,000
group with the property that for all

93
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,320
elements of the group day doing a star E

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,639
gets back the same element I started

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,280
from and that doesn't matter whether you

96
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,520
apply E on the right or on the left

97
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,320
either way you get back your original

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,720
element and you do nothing to it. So for

99
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,479
example in the case of the group being

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,520
you know when we were working with this

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,680
um set of moduli

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,759
uh when we had addition the identity

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
element is zero and when we had

104
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,479
multiplication the identity element was

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,720
one. Okay.

106
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,520
And finally the last property we need

107
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
from our group is the existence of an

108
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,639
inverse.

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,919
So what this means is natural we want

110
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,400
that for all a belonging to our group

111
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:09,360
there is some element which we'll call a

112
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,880
inverse with the property that a inverse

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,520
applied on the left versus a inverse

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,639
applied on the right both of them send

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,400
you back to the identity element. So

116
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
this is the notion of a group. This is

117
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,160
just formalizing

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,759
you know algebraic structures that we've

119
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,000
already seen in action. We've already

120
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,520
seen groups but we didn't think about

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,280
them as abstract sets you know abstract

122
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,440
uh properties.

123
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,440
Um and I'll also mention that you know

124
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,440
additionally

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,840
if we have commutivity

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,800
so if commutivity holds that you know a

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:59,199
star b is equal to b star a then what it

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,960
we we say is that we call g

129
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,800
a billion so it's an aelion group So

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
these are the key definitions for today

131
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,440
and what we're going to do is we're

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
going to understand why this is

133
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,440
powerful. So are there any questions

134
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,160
about the definition of a group

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,560
this makes sense hopefully.

136
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Uh so next let's go through some

137
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,919
examples. We've already seen groups in

138
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,639
action. Um and let's see some examples

139
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,000
just to you know get a feel for what

140
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,319
these definitions are. So one simple

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,039
example is you know an infinite group.

142
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,960
you've been working with all the time.

143
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,960
You can look at the set of integers

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,120
under addition.

145
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,520
Right? So we can check in that case our

146
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
set G is just an infinite set. It's the

147
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,840
set of all integers positive and

148
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,160
negative. Our binary operation is

149
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
addition. And you can check that all of

150
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,759
these properties hold. I take two

151
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,120
integers, I add them up, I definitely

152
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,039
get back an integer. Uh, when I add up

153
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,599
three integers, it doesn't matter the

154
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,479
order that I add them up. I have an

155
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,960
identity element that's zero. I have an

156
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,440
inverse that's just the negative of the

157
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,160
number I started off with. And in fact,

158
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,880
it's also commutative, so it's an aelion

159
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,199
group. So, this is a very simple example

160
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,000
of, you know, a group is just the set of

161
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,560
integers under addition. Uh just as a

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,479
pop quiz, what about the set of integers

163
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,360
under multiplication?

164
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,639
So what if I take the same set but my

165
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,120
binary operation is now multiplication?

166
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
Is that a group?

167
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Why not?

168
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,319
>> Because zero doesn't have [laughter]

169
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,400
zero doesn't have an inverse. And that's

170
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,720
true of all kinds of other elements too.

171
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,639
when I take, you know, the element two,

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
well, I can talk about multiplying by

173
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,240
that element. That'll still send me back

174
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,720
to another integer, but I don't have the

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,520
existence of an inverse because that

176
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,680
would be 1/2 and that's not in my set.

177
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,160
So, a non-example of a group is, you

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,080
know, integers under multiplication. So,

179
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,400
it's not just about the set, but it's

180
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,360
about how the set behaves under the

181
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,240
binary operation I've chosen.

182
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,800
We can do another example with

183
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:32,039
multiplication. We can take the set of

184
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,039
uh rationals minus 0

185
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,519
and we can take

186
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,519
our operation to be multiplication.

187
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,600
So now we do have an inverse because we

188
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,720
just flip the numerator and denominator

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,880
and we once again have a group. Right?

190
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,800
So these are all examples of infinite

191
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,440
groups. And what we'll be particularly

192
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,360
interested in today are finite groups.

193
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,080
That's the part that's going to collect

194
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,399
uh connect with modular arithmetic.

195
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,640
So what about you know finite groups?

196
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,399
In fact I claim we've already seen some

197
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:21,279
examples of uh finite groups in action,

198
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,040
right? So we can take another example.

199
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:28,000
This will be a very important example

200
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:32,160
for us which is we can take ZN which is

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,760
just um you know addition

202
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,560
we can take it with the binary operation

203
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,560
of addition uh you know modular

204
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
addition.

205
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,200
So for example when n equals two this is

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,800
just you know two elements we're looking

207
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,120
at evens and odds and for that you know

208
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,680
finite group just the set of evens and

209
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,560
odds you can check that you know when

210
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
you add up two elements it makes sense

211
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,720
you know an even plus an even takes you

212
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
back to even an odd plus an odd takes

213
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,080
you to even and an even plus an odd

214
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,640
takes you to odd right so in fact um

215
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,800
we've already seen examples of finite

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,240
groups in action that's what we did last

217
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,079
time, right? But let me give you a a

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,399
more interesting example which is going

219
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,399
to show up

220
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,440
okay.

221
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,720
So actually let's do a simple corlary

222
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
first and then we'll get to that

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
example.

224
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,120
You know this will be a correlary of

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,760
that key lema I wrote up there. So let's

226
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,079
look at the set ZN minus 0. So I'm just

227
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,880
looking at the remainders when I take

228
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:49,040
mod n but I'm removing the zero elements

229
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,040
and if I look at this finite set with

230
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
multiplication

231
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:05,200
I claim that this is a group

232
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,200
if and only if n is prime

233
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,680
and I'm writing this as a correl

234
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,959
because really it's a corollary of this

235
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,279
key lema that we showed last time.

236
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,120
So let's prove this lema just to get

237
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,680
some familiarity with groups.

238
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,920
So this is an if and only if statement.

239
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,399
Uh let's prove the reverse direction

240
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:32,000
first. So let's suppose that n is prime.

241
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,320
Then uh why exactly you know is this a

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
group? Now some properties you know a

243
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,519
bunch of properties of the group are

244
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
sort of tedious to check and they're

245
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,040
very natural. So you know if I take

246
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,440
multiplication mod n it's definitely

247
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,440
closed. You know that's what it means to

248
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,760
do modular multiplication. We talked

249
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,920
about that last time. You just multiply

250
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,880
the two numbers and subtract off as many

251
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,079
multiples of n as you can and you'll get

252
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,560
back to some remainder. No big deal.

253
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,399
It's associative because really

254
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,920
multiplication is associative and we're

255
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,519
just subtracting off multiples of n. Uh

256
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,680
you know the main question and the

257
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,639
identity element is easy. That's also

258
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,600
one. I take any remainder multiply it by

259
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,399
one I still get the same remainder. The

260
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,720
tricky thing is really the inverse right

261
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,360
that's where this corollary becomes

262
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,160
interesting. So the key thing to check

263
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:31,040
is that uh there is an inverse and

264
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:35,680
really from our lema. So if n is prime

265
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,639
we know by the key lema from last time

266
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,639
that every element

267
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,000
has a multiplicative inverse.

268
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,839
So that proves one direction you know of

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,639
our corlary.

270
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,720
Uh you know the converse is equally

271
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,880
simple. So let's prove that you know uh

272
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,959
if n is com we'll actually prove it in

273
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,959
the contraositive. So let's suppose

274
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,680
that n is composite.

275
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,920
So what I just proved was that if n is

276
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,079
prime then it's a group. But let's prove

277
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,720
that you know if n is not prime if it's

278
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,399
a composite that we don't have a group

279
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
right

280
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,200
and how am I going to prove that this is

281
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,519
not a group what I'm going to do is I'm

282
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,839
going to construct an element that

283
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,680
doesn't have a multiplicative inverse

284
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
because that's where all this action is

285
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,399
happening in the proof of this

286
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,360
corollary.

287
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,880
So any guesses for what kind of element

288
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,880
might not have a multiplicative inverse?

289
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,920
Any good ideas? We already know this

290
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,560
lema tells us a bunch of things do have

291
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,480
multiplicative inverses. So where should

292
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,120
I look for something that doesn't have a

293
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,160
multiplicative inverse? I should look

294
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,880
for an element A where the GCD between A

295
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,600
and N is not one. Right? So let's just

296
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,600
take any old

297
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:20,000
element A with the property that the GCD

298
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:23,279
between A and N is not equal to one.

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,040
Right? And so you know the lema tells us

300
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,519
already you know the work is already

301
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,920
done for us that that element does not

302
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,079
have a multiplicative inverse. So it

303
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,079
fails our property four of being a

304
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,079
group.

305
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,320
So when we were doing modular arithmetic

306
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
and we were worrying about

307
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,720
multiplicative inverses really what we

308
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
were doing was we were characterizing

309
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,480
when exactly we had this group

310
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,160
structure.

311
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,279
So that's the first point is that we

312
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,199
were really doing group theory last time

313
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,279
and you know what we're going to do now

314
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,040
is we're going to understand some of the

315
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,040
implications of having this abstraction.

316
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,440
All right.

317
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,120
Uh actually let me make one comment

318
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,839
first. So just as a quick comment this

319
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,880
will be very useful for later. So

320
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,240
imagine that uh we take n which is

321
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,760
composite. We now know that the nonzero

322
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,839
elements of ZN do not form a group. But

323
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,040
it turns out that even though it's not a

324
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,120
group, there is a group hiding inside.

325
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,519
So this will be very useful for us. So

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,040
there is a way to fix the failure of

327
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,000
this group property. What we can do is

328
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,519
we can let ZN

329
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,040
star

330
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:49,519
just be the set of elements A belonging

331
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:53,600
to ZN with the property that the GCD of

332
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,600
A and N is equal to one.

333
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,959
So what I claim and I'll just assert

334
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,880
this but the proof is very simple. It

335
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:05,839
just again follows from this key lema

336
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,680
last time. What I claim is that ZN star

337
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,000
equipped with the multiplication

338
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,839
operation is a group.

339
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,160
So that's our key fact that we're going

340
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,040
to be using. So even though there are

341
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,440
elements, you know, belonging to ZN that

342
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,199
are not zero that do not have a

343
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,600
multiplicative inverse. So we failed to

344
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,399
be a group, we can just take the set of

345
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,880
elements that do have an inverse. the

346
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,480
set of all elements a where the gcd is

347
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,360
one and what I claim is that that's a

348
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,800
group sitting inside this other thing

349
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,279
that failed to be a group

350
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,279
so the main point for today's lecture is

351
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,360
we're going to uh develop some

352
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,279
understanding of you know properties of

353
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,040
groups we're going to prove something

354
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,240
called lrangees theorem which is going

355
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,600
to have a ton of cool um you know simple

356
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
to understand applications

357
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,560
So let's go a little further with you

358
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,560
know group theory.

359
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:13,520
Let me give you a key definition.

360
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:17,400
The order of a group

361
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,400
of a finite group

362
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,799
G

363
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,799
is just the number of elements

364
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,760
and we denote it by size of G this way.

365
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,799
So we're just measuring the number of

366
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,960
elements in G. Okay?

367
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,760
And you shouldn't yet see why this is a

368
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,320
very useful notion, but that's where

369
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,480
Lrangees theorem is going to kick in.

370
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,240
But let's do some examples just to make

371
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,480
sure that, you know, we're on the same

372
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,880
page. So we can look at, you know, ZN

373
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,559
with multiplication

374
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,400
um for prime n.

375
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,600
So we already proved in our corollary

376
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,480
that when n is prime, this is a group.

377
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,039
So what's the order of this group? Well,

378
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,640
the order of this group

379
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,679
uh you know ZN sorry ZN

380
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,679
uh minus 0 because the element zero

381
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,559
doesn't work.

382
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,559
Well, this is just N minus one for this

383
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,880
group just because I've uh uh removed

384
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,880
that element.

385
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,919
Okay. So now um the key property we're

386
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,880
gonna Okay. So then let's do one more

387
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,679
example and this will be a a crucial

388
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,039
example that we use for later. So let's

389
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,960
imagine that M is composite. We can look

390
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:50,400
at Z MM star again with multiplication

391
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:55,120
and let's assume that you know M is

392
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,960
equal to P * Q where both P and Q are

393
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,120
primes and they're distinct primes.

394
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,520
So this is one simple example. you know

395
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,720
m is composite so zm you know minus0 is

396
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,320
not a group but if we only look at the

397
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,559
set of elements that have a

398
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,200
multiplicative inverse we know that it's

399
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,280
a group the question is what's the order

400
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,200
of this group so how many elements are

401
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,000
actually in the set zm star so this is

402
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,080
really just a counting argument right

403
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,039
because what we want to do is we want to

404
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:35,039
count the number of a's such that the

405
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:37,760
gcd between a and m is equal to one.

406
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,440
So now what I can do is I can use my old

407
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,320
friend inclusion exclusion. Right? So

408
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,960
what I can do is I can overount. So I

409
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,720
can start off with you know PQ minus one

410
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,280
because those are all of the elements

411
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,559
that are in consideration you know in

412
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,280
the set and then what I can do is I can

413
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,200
subtract off the things which fail to

414
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,080
have gcd1.

415
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:08,240
So what are the ways that a could fail

416
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,360
to have gcd with m uh one? Well it could

417
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,480
have gcd equal to p or it could have gcd

418
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,640
equal to q. So the question is just how

419
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,080
many elements you know how many choices

420
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,880
of A are there where the GCD between A

421
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,600
and M would be P? How many are there

422
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,280
where the GCD would be Q?

423
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,840
Because that's the amount by which I've

424
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,200
overounted. So I should subtract off

425
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,240
those things. And you can subtract off P

426
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,799
minus one. This is just you know the

427
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:46,400
number of A's where the GCD

428
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:49,360
of A and M is equal to Q. In particular,

429
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,000
A should be a multiple of Q in order for

430
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,480
this to be true. And then there are P

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,960
minus one possibilities for what that

432
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,919
is. And I can do the same thing the

433
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,960
other direction. um I can subtract off

434
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,120
the things which are multiples of P and

435
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm going to get q minus one of these

436
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,720
elements and there's nothing that's a

437
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,760
multiple of both p and q because the

438
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,799
largest my remainder gets to is pq minus

439
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,799
one. So this even though it sounds like

440
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,960
a pretty you know tedious example this

441
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,919
turns out to be an extremely important

442
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,960
example. So just to write down what the

443
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,400
expression is, it's p minus one * q

444
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,720
minus one. And what I promise you is

445
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,919
that this expression is going to come up

446
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,400
in a very magical way later. In fact, I

447
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:43,440
claim that this expression is the key to

448
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,440
RSA encryption. So we'll see a bit of a

449
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,320
hint of that. But this expression is

450
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,799
very important. It's just the order of

451
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,799
this group that you know has fixed the

452
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,200
fact that our original attempt was not a

453
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,000
group. So are there any questions about

454
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,000
where we are right now? The notion of

455
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,919
groups makes sense and the order makes

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,320
sense. Hopefully

457
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,600
any questions.

458
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,600
Good. All right.

459
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,440
So

460
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,280
I want to get up to Lrangeas theorem.

461
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
But next we have you know one more

462
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,679
abstraction before I can tell you

463
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,679
Lrron's theorem.

464
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,240
This is our last abstraction for today.

465
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,000
We can also talk about the notion of a

466
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,799
subgroup. So imagine I gave you a pair G

467
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,799
and star. So G is the set and we'll be

468
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,600
interested in finite sets for today. And

469
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,400
then we have this binary operation star.

470
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,799
And let's assume that it's a group. So

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,200
it satisfies all the axioms one through

472
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,320
four of being a group.

473
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,200
And let's imagine that you give me some

474
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,320
subset of the group. You just keep some

475
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,880
of the elements and let's call that H.

476
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:06,280
Well, if

477
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,280
this pair H and star is also a group.

478
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:16,679
Then what we do is we say that H

479
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,679
is a subgroup.

480
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,400
So this is our key definition. So not

481
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,720
only you know do we have a group but

482
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,159
sometimes inside a group we have other

483
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,440
smaller groups sitting inside them.

484
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
And what we're going to do is we're

485
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,000
going to show that whenever we have a

486
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,760
subgroup, we can say something very

487
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,200
interesting about the relationship

488
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,360
between H and G. So that's where we're

489
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,080
headed. But let's do, you know, let's

490
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,280
just be explicit about this, right? So

491
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,480
what does it mean for HAR to be a group,

492
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,840
right? So in particular what this

493
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,320
definition is really telling us

494
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,559
is that we better satisfy a stronger

495
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:06,880
closure property. So when we have any

496
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:11,600
pair of elements AB that belong to H,

497
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:15,120
we need that A* B belongs to H as well.

498
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,520
See A and B are both elements of G. So

499
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,720
we're automatically guaranteed that Aar

500
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,880
B belongs to G. But this is the stronger

501
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,120
statement that when A and B are actually

502
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,320
not just in G but they're sitting inside

503
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,480
H then the result of you know

504
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,080
multiplying them should be something

505
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:38,240
that's in H2. So the critical thing here

506
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:41,679
is that this should not just be in G

507
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,720
but in H itself. And the same thing is

508
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,320
true for the inverse too. Right? We need

509
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,360
that for all elements A belong to H.

510
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,520
Well, a is in G, so there is an inverse.

511
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,919
But the key thing is that this inverse

512
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,760
actually belongs to H and again not G.

513
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,919
So somehow when you're doing the binary

514
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,400
operations or when you're looking for

515
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,360
the inverse, you never have to go

516
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,440
outside of the set you started from even

517
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,400
though it lives inside a much bigger

518
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,240
group. So that's the idea. So this is,

519
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,400
you know, a key definition. This is very

520
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,760
subtle. Uh, are there any questions

521
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,760
about the definition for a subgroup?

522
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,480
All right. So, I'm going to state

523
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,480
Lrange's

524
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,320
and then we're going to go through some

525
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,320
examples

526
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,760
and we'll prove Lrange's theorem and

527
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,640
then I'll tell you some awesome

528
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,640
applications of it.

529
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,039
So what I claim relating all these

530
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:54,080
concepts we've done so far. So if G is

531
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:58,440
finite, it's a finite group and

532
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,440
H is a subgroup.

533
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,640
Then what I claim is that the order of H

534
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,480
divides the order of G.

535
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,799
This is why we care about orders

536
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,559
already, right? See, when you tell me

537
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,559
the group and you tell me the order, you

538
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,320
know, how many elements belong to this

539
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,000
group,

540
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,360
well,

541
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,799
that imposes some restrictions on what

542
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,679
kinds of subgroups you can find.

543
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,039
Say if I have my original group is you

544
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:39,279
know order six this tells me no matter

545
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:42,320
where I look I cannot find a subgroup of

546
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,760
order four because it wouldn't divide

547
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,279
it. So this is a really beautiful fact

548
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,000
even though it sounds like we haven't

549
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,760
assumed very much just G satisfies these

550
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,760
simple axioms and H is a subgroup

551
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,400
automatically we can say something very

552
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,039
striking and powerful about the

553
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,200
relationship between H and G that tells

554
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,720
us something very important structure on

555
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,720
what H could be. So we're going to prove

556
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,720
this but first let's give you know some

557
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,720
examples.

558
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:26,799
just to make this explicit,

559
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:30,559
right? So let's let G denote Z7 minus 0.

560
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,200
7 is prime. So this is a group. It has

561
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,960
six elements, right?

562
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:41,279
And now what's going on is that uh you

563
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,799
know the subgroup H we can take to be

564
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,559
the elements 1 2 4

565
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,799
and what you can do is you can just

566
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,720
check that when I take any of these two

567
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:56,799
elements you know 1 * 2 1* 4 I go back

568
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,880
within the subgroup right and 2 * 4 I go

569
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,120
back to the subgroup because it gives me

570
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,600
one

571
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,600
um and uh you know you can check that

572
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,679
every element has a multiplicative

573
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,000
inverse because in fact the

574
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,919
multiplicative inverse of four is two

575
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,279
and similarly the multiplicative inverse

576
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,080
of two is four. In fact one of the

577
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:21,360
elegant ways to see that this is a

578
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,840
subgroup is actually by realizing that

579
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,480
you know there's a way to express this

580
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,760
subgroup in a different way.

581
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,760
So an easy and powerful way to see this

582
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,600
that'll be very useful for what we do

583
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,679
later in terms of applications of

584
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:43,480
lrangege is that all of these elements

585
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,480
of the subgroup are all powers of two.

586
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,240
So 2 to the 1 is 2 mod 7.

587
00:28:51,679 --> 00:29:05,840
2 3 is 1 mod 7 and 2 to the sorry 2 to

588
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:08,559
the two is 4 mod 7. So all of the

589
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,520
elements we got 1 2 and four they were

590
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,080
powers of two. So why do we have the

591
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,840
closure properties? is just because when

592
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,080
I take different powers of two and

593
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,840
multiply them, I'm just adding their

594
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,840
exponents.

595
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,480
So really this is the set of remainders

596
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,840
you get from taking powers of two and

597
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,159
looking at the remainder mod 7.

598
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,240
So this is one example of how to build a

599
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,880
subgroup is really with powers of some

600
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,360
element. And this will be a crucial way

601
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,279
that we we use lrangees theorem, but

602
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,120
I'll have to explain that later.

603
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,080
And of course you can check the obvious

604
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,480
thing that Lrange's theorem checks out

605
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,080
uh in this case because you know the

606
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,399
size of G is six the size of H is three.

607
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,159
So you know three really does divide

608
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:01,039
six. Okay.

609
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,679
All right. So, let me pause here and ask

610
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,440
you guys if you have any questions again

611
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,760
because if not, we're going to do the

612
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,440
proof of lrangees theorem. And that's

613
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,520
where we're going to assemble all of

614
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,039
these definitions from groups and

615
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,559
subgroups that we've been talking about

616
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,120
so far. So, uh, ask me questions to slow

617
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,200
me down. They should hopefully be about

618
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,200
the course material, but if not, that's

619
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,200
fine.

620
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,880
I'm just going to stare awkwardly until

621
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,120
someone asks me a question. Everyone

622
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:41,360
understands everything. You promise?

623
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,080
Yes. Okay. All right. I'll take it. So,

624
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,880
let's prove Lrron's theorem. This will

625
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,960
be the main proof we do today, but then

626
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,200
we'll get a whole bunch of amazing

627
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,720
applications out of it. And this fact

628
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,000
that I promised you is going to come

629
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,080
back later on. Okay, but we can already

630
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,240
see some hint about why this fact is

631
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,720
powerful. Counting the number of group

632
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,880
elements tells us something very

633
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,320
powerful about the types of subgroups we

634
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,320
can expect to see inside.

635
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,159
All right,

636
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,279
so let's prove it here. I think I should

637
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,279
have enough space.

638
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,679
Now this is really just a counting

639
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,440
argument using the group structure.

640
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,919
After all we just want to prove some

641
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,000
statement about divisibility.

642
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,919
So you know really what's going on here

643
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,640
the way to prove lrangees theorem at a

644
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,480
high level is to break G up into

645
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,919
different pieces.

646
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,399
You know we already have a subgroup

647
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,480
which is one piece of G. But the

648
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,519
question is how can I translate that

649
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,159
subgroup around to cover all of G in a

650
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,840
nice even way. So that's the intuition

651
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,480
behind Lrron's proof and you know making

652
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,399
this precise we have to talk about you

653
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,039
know what are these translates and this

654
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,480
takes us to the notion of a co-et. So,

655
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:14,880
as I promised you, the main idea

656
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,399
is to partition G.

657
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
And we're going to build up this

658
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,960
partition one by one. And we're going to

659
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,960
partition it into something called

660
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,480
co-sets.

661
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,200
These are really just translates of my

662
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,320
original subgroup. So, if you take any

663
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,000
element belonging to the group, what

664
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,960
we're going to do is we're going to

665
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,559
consider the following set. It's called

666
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,159
XH

667
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:46,159
and it's really the set of all XY where

668
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,840
Y belongs to H. Right?

669
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
So what's going on is for the definition

670
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,080
of the subgroup we needed the property

671
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,760
that when I take a pair of elements

672
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,159
belonging to H we go back within H. Here

673
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,120
I'm taking a pair of elements one of

674
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,519
which belongs to H and one of which is

675
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,159
general. And these are my different

676
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,320
translates. So I'm not just considering

677
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,120
an X which belongs to H. But as I

678
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,440
arrange X over the group, I'm going to

679
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,679
get different pieces of the group,

680
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,240
right? When X belongs to H, I'm just

681
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,559
getting back H. And when X is something

682
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,519
else that does not belong to H, it's a

683
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,600
translate of the thing I started from.

684
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,799
So these are called co-sets. In fact,

685
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,840
this is called a left co-set because the

686
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,320
element that um you know I'm taking from

687
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,159
G is multiplied on the left and right

688
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,320
co-ets would be the same thing but on

689
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,760
the other side.

690
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,919
So now uh you know here's our plan. This

691
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:49,279
is our plan of action is what we want to

692
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,399
do is we want to show that G can be

693
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:56,399
written as X1H

694
00:33:52,399 --> 00:34:02,000
union disjoint union X2H

695
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:04,080
all the way up to disjoint union X KH.

696
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,039
So what's going on is I have K different

697
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,040
co-ets one for each of these XI. I

698
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,200
haven't told you how to find them. We'll

699
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,359
talk about that in a minute. But I want

700
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,240
the property that I can choose X1

701
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:20,560
through X K so that their resulting

702
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,200
co-etss together make up G and there's

703
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,839
no overlap between them. So what this

704
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,079
symbol means is it's not the union, it's

705
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,040
the disjoint

706
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,320
union. So I want all of these things to

707
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,599
have empty intersection.

708
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,760
Okay, so that's my plan. And if this

709
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,720
were true, Lrange's theorem would be

710
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,320
done, right? Because what is the s you

711
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,079
know each of these elements right here?

712
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,839
We're going to prove that each of these

713
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:53,280
co-ets has size order of H. And then

714
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,440
we've written G as K copies of H. So

715
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,920
that'll be our plan.

716
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,920
So here are the things we need to show.

717
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,720
And I haven't even told you, you know,

718
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,520
how to build up this set.

719
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,160
uh what I want to show is that the size

720
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:15,599
of each of these co-ets you know XH is

721
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,160
equal to the size of H. And I want to

722
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:23,200
show that the way that I've built it up

723
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:27,119
the intersection between any pair of

724
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,079
elements of any pair of co-etss is uh

725
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,240
zero. And this should be true for all I

726
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,000
not equal to J.

727
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,000
So in fact we're going to have a very

728
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,520
simple plan for how to generate these

729
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,040
XI's.

730
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,240
All we're going to do is you know we're

731
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,680
just greedily

732
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,680
pick an uncovered XI.

733
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,839
So I start off before I've built up a

734
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,400
single co-et. I have nothing. I've

735
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,520
covered none of the elements of G. I

736
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,520
take any arbitrary element X belonging

737
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,960
to G that's not covered which is all of

738
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,320
them. That will be my X1

739
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,480
that defines a co-et. I pull that co-et

740
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,960
out of G. All of those elements are now

741
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,960
covered. And then I take any other

742
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,119
element that's not yet covered. That's

743
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,839
my X2. It defines a co-et. I pull it out

744
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,560
and I keep recursing

745
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,599
in this way. But I have to prove that

746
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,760
this really does create a disjoint union

747
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,400
of G. Everything is covered at the end

748
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,640
and it's covered once and only once. And

749
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,920
I have to prove that each time I pull

750
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,800
out a piece, a co-et, it has exactly the

751
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,800
same size. So if we can prove these two

752
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,359
properties, we're done. And we've proved

753
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,240
lrangees theorem. But now proving these

754
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,599
two properties will just be about using

755
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,680
the axioms of group theory. So this is

756
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,079
where group theory is a powerful

757
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,079
definition. We haven't seen it yet but

758
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,640
we will in a minute is to prove these

759
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,760
two properties.

760
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,320
So let's show these two properties. So

761
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
first let's show

762
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,280
one.

763
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,040
Okay.

764
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,440
And

765
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,440
let's suppose

766
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,920
that

767
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:30,160
X H1 equals XH2

768
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:34,480
for some H1 and H2 belonging to my

769
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,520
subgroup capital H. So what is the way

770
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,400
that I wouldn't get the co-et has size

771
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,320
order H? Really the way that the co-et

772
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:47,760
is defined is once I fixed x I look at

773
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,520
you know xar y

774
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,240
for all y and h and if for different

775
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,920
choices of y I get the same element when

776
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,640
I do that multiplication I get a

777
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,280
collision that's the only way that I

778
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,599
don't have an equality here if that

779
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,680
doesn't happen then I really do have

780
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,280
that my co-et equals the order of the

781
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,240
subgroup every distinct choice of y is

782
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,440
going to lead to a distinct product.

783
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,400
Right? So let's imagine that we had two

784
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:25,599
elements H1 and H2 that X * H1 and X *

785
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,560
H2 were the same thing, right? And now

786
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,240
you know what should I do? I claim that

787
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,079
you know the way that my proof strategy

788
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,640
wants to work, right? This you know this

789
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,520
won't be a very complicated proof but

790
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,240
the logic is subtle. So what I want to

791
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,400
do is I want to show that h1 and h2 must

792
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,480
be the same thing.

793
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,640
I want to show that the only way that

794
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,599
you get the same element when you get x

795
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:56,240
* h1 is equal to x * h2 is if h1 equals

796
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,880
h2. So how should I do that?

797
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,280
How should I conclude that h1 and h2 are

798
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,280
the same thing?

799
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,320
And you know my hint is that you know

800
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,760
the critical thing in Lrange's theorem

801
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,760
is if G is a group so what should I use

802
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,000
about the group axioms in order to

803
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,400
conclude this fact?

804
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,160
That's my key question. You promised me

805
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,440
you guys understood everything up until

806
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,640
that point. So which axiom should I use?

807
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,640
I got you guys on the hook. Now

808
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,119
who can make me happy?

809
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,119
People

810
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,920
are not making eye contact.

811
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,359
>> Yeah.

812
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,880
>> Yeah. Maybe we could use like the

813
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,280
existence of X inverse.

814
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,920
>> Yeah. That's right. That's a great idea.

815
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,839
Let's use the existence of X inverse,

816
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
right?

817
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,000
And that'll work. So now what we're

818
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,000
going to do is we're going to left

819
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
multiply

820
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,440
by X inverse. See this is where I need

821
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:06,320
the group structure is that X inverse

822
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:09,839
exists. Right? So once X inverse exists

823
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:14,720
then what this is going to imply is that

824
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:19,280
uh you know uh X inverse

825
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:25,280
X H1 and now I can use associivity

826
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:28,000
is equal to X inverse X H2. And when I

827
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,400
use associivity and the property of the

828
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,560
inverse that it equals the identity and

829
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,359
that identity times an element is the

830
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,400
element, it's going to imply that H1

831
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,480
equals H2. So in fact the critical thing

832
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,400
was the inverse but we really used all

833
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,960
of the properties like you know the fact

834
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,440
that we have associivity, the fact that

835
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,119
we get back the identity element and the

836
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,760
fact that the identity element doesn't

837
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,440
change any of those things. So in this

838
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,839
one step we've used you know all the

839
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,240
properties of groups which is great and

840
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,480
it implies the thing we're after but

841
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,079
this finishes this first part in the

842
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,839
proof. Every co-et has the same size

843
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,599
because when I take different elements

844
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:13,200
of h I cannot get the same thing because

845
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:16,200
of the inverse. So we're halfway home.

846
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Right?

847
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,119
So let's show property two and then

848
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,119
we'll be done with Lrron's theorem.

849
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,599
So now let's show two.

850
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,800
Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm

851
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,800
going to suppose that

852
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:44,640
they're not disjoint these co-etss we

853
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:50,800
get. So let's suppose for i less than j

854
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,319
we have the property that x i h1 equals

855
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,000
xj

856
00:41:52,319 --> 00:42:03,520
h2 and this is true you know for some

857
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,480
h1 and h2 belonging to h. So we just

858
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,880
proved that you know we don't have any

859
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,040
collisions within the co-et we don't get

860
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,720
back the same element.

861
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,599
Now what I want to do is I want to

862
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,880
suppose for the sake of contradiction

863
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,160
that you know there's some co-et i and

864
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,000
there's some co-et j that intersect and

865
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,560
that means that there's some element I

866
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,359
got out of one which is you know x i *

867
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,560
h1 and that's the same as the element I

868
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,760
got out of the later coset which is xj *

869
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,040
h2. So this is what it means for the two

870
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,480
co-etss to not be disjoint is that they

871
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,400
have a collision for some H1 and H2. And

872
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,960
now we're going to try and get a

873
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,359
contradiction. Right?

874
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,240
So what I want to do I'm going to ask

875
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:56,240
you guys to help me out is that I want

876
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,359
to show that you know XJ actually

877
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:05,359
belonged to an earlier co-et.

878
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:09,800
So I want to show that XJ belongs

879
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,800
to an earlier co-et.

880
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,520
This would let me be done, right?

881
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,960
Because what is the way that I built up

882
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,440
my co-etss? I started off with any X

883
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,119
that was uncovered and I chose it as my

884
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,680
X1 and I pulled out the entire co-et.

885
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,839
And then I took any x2 that was still

886
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,920
not covered. I used it to find a co-et

887
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,920
and pull it out. So if some xj later

888
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,480
down the line actually belongs to an

889
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,760
earlier co-et, then that means I

890
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,640
shouldn't have done that. It should have

891
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,560
been pulled out before. Right? So what

892
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,960
I'm really saying logically is that if

893
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,839
this weren't true, if the intersection

894
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,680
were non zero, then I actually haven't

895
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,920
implemented this procedure I told you

896
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,359
correctly because xj was already

897
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,079
covered.

898
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,160
So now you know same question right I'm

899
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,760
telling you what I want to show this is

900
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,280
what we're assuming for the purpose of

901
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,960
contradiction

902
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,200
how can I show that xj

903
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,440
belongs to an earlier co-et and I'll

904
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,480
give you a hint it should be the co-et

905
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,640
defined by x i and same thing is going

906
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,200
to be true here we just need to figure

907
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,319
out what property of a group or subgroup

908
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:29,359
we should apply right so what should I

909
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:32,079
do to this expression h uh Xi H1 equals

910
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,280
Xj H2

911
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:40,000
to try and derive an expression where XJ

912
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,760
belongs to a co-et the coset of XI.

913
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,160
What about

914
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:50,400
right multiplying by H2 inverse?

915
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,880
Okay, so let's see what happens.

916
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,480
So let's

917
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:04,240
let's write multiply by h2 inverse. So

918
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:06,640
we get x i h1 h2 inverse is equal to xj.

919
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,839
I wanted to show that xj belongs to an

920
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,359
earlier co-et. Why is this expression

921
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:16,160
showing that xj belongs to an earlier

922
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:20,640
co-et? So what can I say about this

923
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,440
element right here? H1 H2 inverse.

924
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,800
Yeah,

925
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,280
>> it's an element in H.

926
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,040
>> It's an element in H. Right. Why?

927
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,400
Because H2 inverse belongs to H. And

928
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,800
then I'm multiplying two things

929
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,520
belonging to H. So we've used the two

930
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,839
key closure properties of the subgroup.

931
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:44,640
Right? And so what this means

932
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:48,160
is that you know XJ belongs to the set

933
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,160
XI H.

934
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,400
And that means that XJ should have been

935
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,200
covered and we shouldn't have considered

936
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,920
it to begin with. So that's our proof

937
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,200
like this is not a long proof but the

938
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,200
logic for this is very subtle. We used

939
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,079
everything that we could have used about

940
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,960
groups and subgroups just to prove these

941
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,960
few lines of this logical argument. Once

942
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,640
we had the strategy of how to partition

943
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,119
it into co-sets and we had this

944
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,040
definition of a co-et where we needed

945
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,920
the group theory and the subgroups was

946
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,000
really the structural properties that

947
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,760
forced these properties one and two to

948
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,440
be true. So this is a tricky proof. Uh I

949
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,440
will ask again any questions.

950
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,839
Is everyone comfortable with this proof?

951
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,480
So I can give you my pop quiz now.

952
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,119
That'll count towards 50% of your grade.

953
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,560
I'm just kidding.

954
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,400
Boy, would the people who didn't show up

955
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,640
today be upset. We should do that at

956
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,520
some point.

957
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,960
All right. Uh, so let's, you know, now

958
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,760
that we've done this hard work of

959
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,760
proving Lrange's theorem, let's see some

960
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,760
payoff.

961
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,440
So let me tell you some

962
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,720
awesome statements that are going to

963
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,400
follow as you know an application of

964
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,000
lrangees theorem

965
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,560
and it's going to connect all of the

966
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,640
tools we talked about subgroups powers

967
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,560
of elements

968
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:29,119
uh the order and everything.

969
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:31,599
So this is a theorem called uh format's

970
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,240
little theorem. We're not going to prove

971
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:41,240
for's last theorem.

972
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:41,240
Uh so what I claim is that if p is prime

973
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:49,880
and a

974
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,880
is not divisible by p.

975
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:01,520
Then

976
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:03,839
a to the p minus one is congruent to 1

977
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,040
mod p.

978
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,920
This is a beautiful identity, right? In

979
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:14,960
particular, what this means is really

980
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:18,079
that a to the p minus 2*

981
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,040
a is equal to 1.

982
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,280
So this gives me an explicit algebraic

983
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,680
expression for what the multiplicative

984
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,520
inverse is. Last time we talked about

985
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,559
how we could compute the multiplicative

986
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,960
inverse by using the extended uklidian

987
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,119
algorithm. It turns out you can also do

988
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,599
it by powering.

989
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,520
If you give me a and I know that p is

990
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,240
prime, all I have to do is raise a to

991
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,640
the p minus2 power and that is the

992
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,960
multiplicative inverse. You can check

993
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,359
that all of our examples satisfy that

994
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,839
property. That's why two and four were

995
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,680
multiplicative inverses of each other.

996
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,240
Uh was just that you take one and you

997
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,520
raise it to the p minus 2 power and

998
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,599
that'll give you the other one.

999
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,760
So this property it doesn't seem like

1000
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,760
it's connected to lrangege but it is.

1001
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,680
So it turns out that uh we're going to

1002
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,960
prove it through lrangees theorem.

1003
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,480
Right? So what I'm going to do is I'm

1004
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:22,440
going to have a key definition which is

1005
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,440
I'll let K be the smallest integer

1006
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:37,000
such that

1007
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:37,000
a to the k is congruent to one mod p.

1008
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,599
So now uh the basic idea is that I have

1009
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,559
to prove that such a K exists. It's not

1010
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,680
obvious that there should always be a K.

1011
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,520
And once I know that there is a K, I'll

1012
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,280
relate it to the order of the group

1013
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,920
because this is going to define a

1014
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,160
subgroup. And that'll tell me something

1015
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,680
about you know when I use Lrangees

1016
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,680
theorem and I relate that to the order

1017
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,240
of the actual group which is P minus

1018
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,200
one, that'll tell me that the same thing

1019
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,079
holds with P minus one instead.

1020
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,920
So really you know this is the plan.

1021
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:20,760
First I have to show that such a K

1022
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,760
exists. So you know why is there any K

1023
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,319
and now we get to use a lot of the tools

1024
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,000
we've talked about in the class so far.

1025
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,960
So we get to connect it to a lot of

1026
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,920
earlier tools right I claim we can prove

1027
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:42,760
this by pigeon hole principle.

1028
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,760
So let's assume that there is no K.

1029
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,680
Suppose there is no such K. Then what I

1030
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,680
claim is that by the pigeon hole

1031
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:56,079
principle,

1032
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,319
there must exist some I less than J with

1033
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:04,480
the property that A to the I is

1034
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:06,000
congruent to A to the J mod P.

1035
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,960
So what I'm going to do is I start off

1036
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,680
with A. I raise it to different powers

1037
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,359
and I stop at the first power where what

1038
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,079
I get is congruent to one mod p. Let's

1039
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:21,680
suppose I never stop. What if I just

1040
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,839
kept going? Well, there are only so many

1041
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,640
other values for what the remainder when

1042
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,880
I divide by p can be. And eventually

1043
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,520
when I consider high enough powers, I

1044
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,119
must be getting some kind of collision.

1045
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,680
Right?

1046
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:39,839
So once I get this collision that a to

1047
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:43,119
the i equals a to the j let's figure out

1048
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:46,480
you know why there must exist a k such

1049
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:49,359
that a to the k is congruent to one. So

1050
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,079
what we can do is we can just divide

1051
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:56,319
through by a because there is an inverse

1052
00:51:52,079 --> 00:52:00,319
to a right because p is prime and so we

1053
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:04,000
can write this as a to the j minus i is

1054
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:06,480
congruent to one mod p. This is just

1055
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,119
because a inverse exists and we can get

1056
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,160
rid of powers of a

1057
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:15,040
right. So when we get rid of i powers of

1058
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:19,200
a from both sides, we get the identity a

1059
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:21,760
to the j minus i is congruent to one mod

1060
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,960
p. And that shows that there must exist

1061
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,640
some k just by pigeonal principle. So

1062
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,920
this is the first thing that I owed you

1063
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,480
is that k exists. Right? And now we're

1064
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,440
going to relate k to p minus one. And

1065
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:39,440
that'll be the proof of vermont.

1066
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:42,319
So this is the first step. And now what

1067
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:46,359
I claim

1068
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,359
the powers of a

1069
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,599
form a subgroup

1070
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,480
and what is the order of this subgroup

1071
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,480
right

1072
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,760
it's K because that's the first time

1073
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,200
when I got back the identity element so

1074
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,880
it was the same way when I did that

1075
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,800
numerical ical example up here. I had a

1076
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,599
subgroup that was really generated by

1077
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,720
powers of two. Now I have a subgroup

1078
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,559
that's generated by powers of a. And my

1079
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,040
order is just the first time that I

1080
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:26,240
return back to the identity element.

1081
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,800
That's what K is. So I have a subgroup

1082
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,440
which is the powers of a and it has

1083
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,359
order K. So what I can do is you know

1084
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,640
now I can appeal to Lrange's theorem. So

1085
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,640
by lranja's theorem

1086
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,839
we know that k the order of my subgroup

1087
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,359
must divide p minus one.

1088
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,440
You remember when we did all those

1089
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,920
computations of what the order of a

1090
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,559
subgroup is when you know n is prime

1091
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,720
when n is the product of two primes. We

1092
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,440
know the order is p minus one because of

1093
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,280
that first example we did. And now we

1094
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,880
can appeal to Lrron's theorem and we

1095
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:11,040
know that k divides p minus one. So now

1096
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,960
we're golden because a to the p minus

1097
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:17,520
one, you know that's the thing we want

1098
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,760
to show is congruent to one mod p.

1099
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,640
And what are we going to do? We're just

1100
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:28,319
going to write this as a to the k raised

1101
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:32,319
to the cth power. If for example P

1102
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:35,200
minus1 equals C * K because K divides P

1103
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,520
minus one. So I'm just rewriting it in a

1104
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,559
different way. And now what do I know

1105
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:44,400
about A to the K? What is it congruent

1106
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,480
to? Mod P. It's congruent to one. So

1107
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,200
this is the same thing as raising one to

1108
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:53,760
the power C,

1109
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:57,280
which is the same thing as one.

1110
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,280
So that's the proof.

1111
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,920
So this is for Mott's little theorem and

1112
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:06,160
even though the statement of it had

1113
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,599
nothing to do with groups right I could

1114
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,920
have stated this for you at the

1115
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,559
beginning of lecture today because we

1116
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,440
knew what modular arithmetic was we know

1117
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,559
what it means to take powers of a but

1118
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,280
somehow the cleanest proof of theorem at

1119
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,599
least one of the cleanest proofs really

1120
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,160
goes through the fact that sitting

1121
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,480
inside the powers of today is some

1122
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,720
understanding of a group structure and

1123
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,680
how that relates to you know the larger

1124
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,200
group that it contains.

1125
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,280
So are there any questions about

1126
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,720
lrangees theorem? H sorry the

1127
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,839
application of lrangees theorem to

1128
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,839
format's little theorem.

1129
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,839
Who's comfortable with the proof? Give

1130
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,799
me a thumbs up. Okay.

1131
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:58,079
All right.

1132
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:00,079
So, one of the uh really cool things you

1133
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,839
can do, let me just take a brief

1134
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:06,559
digression for a minute.

1135
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:09,040
Uh which is that you know something like

1136
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:12,079
for Mott's little theorem there actually

1137
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:15,440
tons of proofs. So, we gave a group

1138
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,680
theoretic proof right now. Let me give

1139
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,000
you a totally different proof just

1140
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,839
because

1141
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,559
and this will connect back to some of

1142
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:29,119
the earlier topics we've seen. I claim

1143
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:33,040
there's a purely combinatorial way

1144
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,200
to prove for uh little theorem and we'll

1145
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,400
prove it in a particular case for a

1146
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:40,160
particular setting of you know a and p.

1147
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,160
So let me give you a combinatorial

1148
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,160
proof.

1149
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:54,880
And let's do the proof specifically in

1150
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:57,280
the case where a= 2 and p equals 5 just

1151
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,280
to be concrete.

1152
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,680
So the way that I'm going to do this is

1153
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,319
I'm actually going to think about a

1154
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,920
counting problem under the hood and

1155
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,920
it'll involve something called

1156
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,880
necklaces.

1157
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,680
So the idea is that um you know when I

1158
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:17,359
take the statement of you know Vermont

1159
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:20,000
right it's the statement that uh a to

1160
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:23,520
the p minus1

1161
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,359
uh is is congruent to one but you know

1162
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,200
another way to think about this

1163
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:31,520
statement

1164
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:36,319
is really the statement that a to the p

1165
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,319
minus a is divisible

1166
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:43,839
by p. That's really what this statement

1167
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:47,040
means because I can take this identity

1168
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:49,839
and I can multiply it through by a. So I

1169
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,400
get a the p minus one is congruent to a

1170
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:55,040
mod p. When I move the a on the other

1171
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,280
side, I get this quantity a the p minus

1172
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,240
a. And the statement that that's

1173
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,240
congruent to zero mod p is really the

1174
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,799
statement that that is a multiple of p.

1175
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,520
Okay. And I claim that there's a

1176
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:11,359
combinatorial proof of this fact which

1177
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,599
will give us you know another way to

1178
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,040
think about you know what format's

1179
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,839
what's happening in for's little

1180
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,000
theorem. So what I'm going to do is I'm

1181
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:22,880
going to count certain combinatorial

1182
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,520
objects and I'm going to prove as a

1183
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,920
corollary that statement.

1184
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,160
Right? So what I can do is I can think

1185
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,319
about strings with different types of

1186
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,599
beads. A is two. So they'll have two

1187
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,799
kinds of beads, red or blue beads. And

1188
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:42,079
their length will be P, which is five.

1189
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:45,720
So I can look at the number of strings

1190
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,720
of length

1191
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:56,240
five over an alphabet.

1192
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:59,040
Those are just the bead types of size

1193
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,280
two. So how many strings are there of

1194
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,079
length five that are composed of, you

1195
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:09,040
know, red and blue beads? That's very

1196
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:12,480
simple. It's uh 2 to the 5, right?

1197
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,079
That's my a to the p right here is 2 to

1198
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,720
the 5. It's just counting the number of

1199
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,240
these strings.

1200
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,880
But what I'm going to do instead of

1201
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:25,559
counting these strings is I'll be

1202
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,559
interested in the number of necklaces.

1203
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,200
So I'll take those strings which are

1204
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,119
length five and I'm going to tie their

1205
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,200
ends together.

1206
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,520
But now the point is that it doesn't

1207
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,280
matter you know for the necklace whether

1208
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,599
it's you know when you take that

1209
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,440
necklace and rotate it it's still the

1210
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,680
same necklace.

1211
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,319
So now I'm losing some information.

1212
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,119
there are fewer necklaces because some

1213
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:50,480
of them are the same thing, right? So

1214
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,119
the question is, you know, how many

1215
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,359
necklaces are there?

1216
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,599
I don't know. It was very easy to count

1217
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:00,480
the number of strings I can get out of

1218
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,640
two beads of length five.

1219
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,799
And you know the way to think about it

1220
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:10,319
is that um when you take an example

1221
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:16,720
let's say right which is a necklace that

1222
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:18,880
looks like red blue red red

1223
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,160
well there are actually many strings it

1224
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,559
could have come from right in fact there

1225
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,760
are five strings it could have come from

1226
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:30,400
which all depend on where the B is.

1227
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:35,040
Maybe the B was the starting point of

1228
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:36,880
the necklace. Maybe it was the second

1229
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,799
and so on. And there are five

1230
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:44,160
possibilities and five is my P. Right?

1231
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:47,440
So in fact some of these necklaces

1232
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:50,640
really come from equivalence classes of

1233
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:53,280
strings that could have generated them.

1234
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:56,240
Now there are some necklaces which don't

1235
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,240
come from five different strings.

1236
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,839
Uh, can anyone give me an example of a

1237
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:05,280
necklace that can only come from one of

1238
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,240
the uh 32 possibilities?

1239
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,079
>> All reds.

1240
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,680
>> All reds. Perfect.

1241
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,079
You know, there are all of these other

1242
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,559
examples. Well, there's two of them. We

1243
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,440
could take all red

1244
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,280
and we could take all blue. This it

1245
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,920
doesn't, you know, any way you rotate

1246
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,680
it, you get back the same thing. So what

1247
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,200
you can show is that these are the only

1248
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,240
two possibilities that you know the

1249
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,240
proof is using the uh uklitian algorithm

1250
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,280
again amazingly

1251
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,119
but um you know here the number of

1252
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,520
necklaces really the way to think about

1253
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,160
them is in different groups either it's

1254
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:46,480
a necklace which comes from five strings

1255
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:49,040
or it's a necklace that comes from one.

1256
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,680
So you know this gives us our proof

1257
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:55,760
right is because you know the statement

1258
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:59,839
is that if we look at five this should

1259
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:04,400
divide 2 5th minus 2. So these are the

1260
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:07,040
number of non monochromatic

1261
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,960
strings.

1262
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,119
And if we just remove all of the

1263
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,000
monochromatic strings, the all red and

1264
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,640
the all blue, the rest of the strings

1265
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,240
have this property that they come in a

1266
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,400
5:1 relationship with the necklaces.

1267
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,720
So in fact, the necklaces gives us a way

1268
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,200
to group the set of strings into groups

1269
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,599
of five. So what does this statement

1270
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,640
look like more generally? This is just

1271
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:36,640
the statement that P divides

1272
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:39,760
A to the P minus A because you'll have a

1273
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,240
monochromatic necklaces and that is

1274
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,160
exactly what format's little theorem is

1275
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,799
telling you.

1276
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,880
So you know once we have enough tools in

1277
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:51,680
uh discrete applied math there's this

1278
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,440
amazing nexus between these things. This

1279
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,680
was a simple statement related to

1280
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,680
modular arithmetic. I can prove it using

1281
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,280
group theory. I can prove it using

1282
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,280
combinotaurics

1283
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,200
and you know there are maybe half a

1284
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,520
dozen different proofs of format's

1285
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,119
little theorem. There are many routes to

1286
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,799
this theorem and they all lead to

1287
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,599
different kinds of abstractions in

1288
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:16,440
different mathematics.

1289
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,440
All right. Any questions about this?

1290
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:30,160
All right. So

1291
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:34,119
I will tell you uh one other statement

1292
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,119
which I promised you.

1293
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,599
This is due to oiler

1294
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,400
and this is the thing which is going to

1295
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,480
have you know amazing applications on

1296
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,559
cryptography when we get to it in in a

1297
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,839
bunch of lectures time we'll do that

1298
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,839
we'll do a whole unit on it later

1299
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,160
this is due to oiler

1300
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,960
So let's say that uh so we're in the

1301
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,319
same setting of format's uh little

1302
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:18,480
theorem except for the fact that we have

1303
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:25,799
a composite. So if m is equal to p * q

1304
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:25,799
where p and q are distinct primes

1305
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,000
and a

1306
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,520
has

1307
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,079
gcd

1308
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:43,839
between a and m equal to 1.

1309
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:48,400
Then what I claim

1310
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:53,839
is that a to the p min -1

1311
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:57,240
* q -1 as congruent to 1

1312
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:57,240
mod m.

1313
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:05,920
So this takes a minute to digest, right?

1314
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,799
So now I'm working modulo m that is not

1315
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,520
prime. So we already know that it's not

1316
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:14,079
a group and not every element has a

1317
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,720
multiplicative inverse

1318
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,920
but some elements do. In particular,

1319
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,440
what are the elements that have a

1320
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,000
multiplicative inverse? Those are the

1321
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,599
A's where the GCD between A and M is

1322
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,520
one.

1323
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,280
So what I'm saying is that all of these

1324
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:30,400
elements that have a multiplicative

1325
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,319
inverse, a version of Format's little

1326
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,960
theorem holds even though we're not

1327
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:36,559
working over a prime. The difference is

1328
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:41,119
that I'm raising it to a different

1329
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:43,359
power. It's not, you know, p minus1,

1330
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,960
you know, anymore where p is the

1331
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:49,119
modulus.

1332
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:51,359
It's now, you know, p min -1 * q -1. So,

1333
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:53,839
we've changed the power we have to raise

1334
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,799
it to in Oilers's.

1335
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:58,640
It turns out that this is really a

1336
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,400
correlary of the proof I already gave

1337
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,240
you.

1338
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,400
There's actually nothing that's really

1339
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:09,920
specific about the fact that P is prime.

1340
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,680
We're just using groups, right?

1341
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,760
So what can I do? Like how does this

1342
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,280
proof change?

1343
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,799
Where did I use the fact that it was

1344
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,359
prime?

1345
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:22,000
Well, uh let K be the smallest integer

1346
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:26,400
so that a to the K is congruent to one

1347
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:29,119
mod M. Right? I have to prove that you

1348
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:32,160
know such an integer exists

1349
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,640
and uh you know if not then there'll be

1350
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,359
some collision where a to the i is

1351
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,599
congruent to a to the j and then I can

1352
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:42,240
still rearrange things because I'm

1353
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:46,240
working with an a whose gcd between a

1354
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:49,520
and m is one so it has an inverse so I

1355
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:52,079
can pull out i powers of a and I'll get

1356
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,799
a the j minus i is congruent to one mod

1357
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:57,520
m. that part still worked. It was

1358
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:59,119
literally the same proof. So such a k

1359
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:02,559
exists.

1360
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:05,359
And now uh that's still a subgroup,

1361
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:07,200
right? When I look at the powers of two

1362
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:10,000
uh look at the powers of a that's still

1363
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,680
a subgroup. I still know its order

1364
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,400
because that's the first time I have a

1365
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,039
collision is at K.

1366
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:20,240
And then uh by lranjes theorem I know

1367
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:22,720
that k divides not p minus one but the

1368
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,559
order of the group. So what did I

1369
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,720
promise you we were going to use was

1370
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,200
this simple example. This computation

1371
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,839
right here. What is the order of the

1372
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,240
multiplicative subgroup sitting inside

1373
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:36,960
ZM which is where the structure is

1374
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:40,559
really happening? It's not M minus one.

1375
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:46,079
It's P min -1 Q -1. So what do we know

1376
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:52,400
is that K divides P minus1 * Q -1. So

1377
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:55,839
then uh you know k is uh p minus1 * q

1378
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:59,839
minus one is equal to c * k. Same thing

1379
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:02,480
happens here. This is p min -1 * q -1

1380
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:06,160
which I'm writing as a the k raised to

1381
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:08,400
the cth power and that's still one.

1382
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:10,000
So in fact what's really cool about this

1383
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,760
right I could have told you all of this

1384
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,520
at the beginning of lecture. We knew

1385
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:17,279
what modular arithmetic was. I could

1386
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:19,120
have stated for the I could have stated

1387
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,400
Oilers's

1388
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,040
and they might have seemed a bit

1389
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:26,400
mysterious like why is the power I'm

1390
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,920
raising things to different depending on

1391
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,319
whether I have a prime or I have a

1392
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,960
product of primes

1393
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:36,000
right and it turns out that once you

1394
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:38,239
have this group theoretic proof of it we

1395
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,799
can see that the reason that we have a

1396
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:42,640
different power is because you know it's

1397
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:45,440
no longer a group and we have to look at

1398
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,120
the order of the subgroup that's inside.

1399
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,799
So that's really what's going in the

1400
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,279
exponent is just the order of the

1401
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:53,040
appropriate subgroup.

1402
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,560
So this is one of the amazing things

1403
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:58,640
about, you know, group theory um is that

1404
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,880
uh it can demystify a lot of these

1405
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,560
statements that otherwise look like

1406
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,279
they're, you know, not quite the same

1407
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:09,040
thing. In fact, here we had literally

1408
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:11,199
the same proof. It was 100% the same

1409
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,400
proof. I just had to cross out a bunch

1410
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:18,120
of things and replace them.

1411
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,120
So, are there any questions?

1412
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,319
All right.

1413
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,640
So, very last thing I'm going to tell

1414
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,640
you

1415
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,920
uh one more abstraction and then I'm

1416
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,279
just going to tell you a theorem because

1417
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,920
we're going to use it later, but we'll

1418
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,920
just take this for granted. So it turns

1419
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:39,520
out, you know, a group has a decent

1420
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,567
amount of structure, but not, you know,

1421
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,880
not everything.

1422
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:44,960
[clears throat] So there's actually

1423
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,120
something you can do which imposes even

1424
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,440
more structure than a group. Actually,

1425
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,279
there are many things you can do. Uh

1426
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,759
there are things called rings. We won't

1427
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:56,000
be interested in those, but we'll be

1428
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,080
interested in something called a field,

1429
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,640
which has a lot more structure than a

1430
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:04,719
group. And when you're dealing with a

1431
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:10,640
field a lot more nice things can happen.

1432
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:15,880
So uh last bit of you know abstract

1433
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,880
algebra is you know a field

1434
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,320
is a set f potentially infinite which

1435
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:24,159
now has two operations addition and

1436
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,480
multiplication

1437
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:29,840
and it satisfies a bunch of properties.

1438
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:33,840
So first of all we need that f and the

1439
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:37,640
operation plus the binary operation is

1440
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,640
an aelion group

1441
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,760
and it'll have identity

1442
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,760
which is some distinguished zero

1443
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,000
element.

1444
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:54,080
We're going to need that multiplication

1445
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,640
is also a group. We need that f minus0

1446
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,920
when we remove out the element that's

1447
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:03,120
the identity for addition. We need that

1448
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,280
the binary operation on whatever remains

1449
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,880
is a group.

1450
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,880
We need that it's an aelion group

1451
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,880
and it'll have identity

1452
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:23,920
one some special element. And the very

1453
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:27,040
last property that we need is we need

1454
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,920
that uh it satisfies the distributive

1455
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:33,600
property.

1456
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:40,560
So we need that uh for all

1457
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:46,960
a b c belonging to my field a times b +

1458
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:49,520
c is the same thing as a * b plus a * c.

1459
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,880
So this is a field. A lot of times we're

1460
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,679
not just dealing with groups. We're

1461
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,239
dealing with fields like the field of

1462
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,760
you know rationals where we have

1463
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:01,640
addition and multiplication and

1464
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,640
everything behaves nicely.

1465
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:07,199
And now here's an amazing theorem which

1466
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:09,920
we're going to use later on when we uh

1467
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:16,679
do more crypto.

1468
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:16,679
Uh what I claim is that any polomial

1469
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:28,679
of degree

1470
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,679
D at least one with coefficients

1471
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:40,440
in my field can have

1472
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,440
at most d roots

1473
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:47,600
in f. So what this means is you can

1474
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:52,640
consider some polomial

1475
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:55,920
p of x which is you know p 0 plus p1x

1476
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:59,199
and so on all the way up to pd you know

1477
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,840
x to the d and the crucial thing is that

1478
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:03,360
you know all of these pi's belong to my

1479
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,760
field

1480
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:09,040
and I'm only going to consider values of

1481
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:11,840
x that belong to my field. So a notion

1482
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:15,040
of a root is can I find an x that

1483
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:18,719
belongs to my field so that p of x

1484
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:21,520
evaluates to zero.

1485
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:23,920
And now it turns out that uh you can

1486
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,920
show you know this basic statement we

1487
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:29,199
know and love about real valued

1488
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:32,400
polomials that they if they have degree

1489
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:35,600
d they have at most d roots. Well that's

1490
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,120
actually a property of a general field.

1491
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,120
So it's not just a property of the

1492
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,440
reals. It generalizes even in this

1493
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,679
sense. So just to give you a hint about

1494
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,360
what we're going to do later. We're

1495
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,080
going to do an application we talk about

1496
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,679
crypto called secret sharing. What we

1497
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,080
want to do is we want to take a secret

1498
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:55,920
and divide it up among a group of n

1499
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:59,199
people so that any k people can recover

1500
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:02,080
the secret but any fewer than that

1501
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:04,880
cannot recover the secret. So they can

1502
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,679
together share their piece of the key

1503
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,199
and find out the answer. And what we're

1504
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,640
going to be interested in is the way

1505
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,800
we're going to build up our secret

1506
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,480
sharing schemes is we're going to be

1507
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,679
working with polomials not over the

1508
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,199
reals but over finite fields. So roughly

1509
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,199
what's going to happen is that the

1510
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,920
secret will be something like you know

1511
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:25,920
the constant coefficient of my polomial.

1512
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,480
So it's some finite value from some

1513
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,960
finite field and then what each of the

1514
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,880
parties are going to have is they're

1515
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,719
going to have the evaluation of this

1516
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:39,840
polomial at some point and together when

1517
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:42,159
they have enough points and evaluations

1518
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,560
they can interpolate the polomial and

1519
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:46,960
find the secret and otherwise they

1520
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:49,040
cannot. So I'll just give you the hint

1521
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:52,159
of that for later. But you know stay

1522
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:54,080
tuned when we do uh cryptography. We're

1523
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:56,880
going to see how this identity namely

1524
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,800
Oilers's theorem is the basis for modern

1525
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,360
cryptography in the RSA encryption

1526
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,360
scheme. And we're going to see how this

1527
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,920
uh statement about polomials and the

1528
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,199
number of roots is the basis for modern

1529
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,600
secret sharing. But we'll get there. So

1530
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:13,040
let's stop here and um I'll take any

1531
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,760
questions you guys have offline.

1532
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:19,880
Otherwise, have a great uh spring break.

1533
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,880
Hope you guys do something fun.
