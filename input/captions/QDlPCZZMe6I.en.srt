1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,540
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob Stoner and

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:14,770
this is what if it

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,770
[Music]

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,119
works from the MIT energy initiative

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
this is what if it works a podcast

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,199
looking at the energy solutions for

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
climate change I'm Cara Miller you might

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,599
know me from the public radio program

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
Innovation Hub which I hosted I now

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,000
write the big idea column for the Boston

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,559
Globe and I'm Robert Stoner the

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,480
president of the Kendall Square project

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,480
and former director of the MIT energy

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,440
initiative and today we're going to talk

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,840
about how science can give rise to

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,399
companies and how we can only fully

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,199
achieve our societal goals if those

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,640
companies and governments can work

19
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:55,039
together but first a little story to

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
illustrate this sort of Journey in the

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,960
1970s and ' 80s three scientists started

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,719
doing work that would ultimately de

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,119
decades later earned them a Nobel Prize

24
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,400
their work was with a very unstable

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,320
element an element that easily catches

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,119
on fire lithium but what they discovered

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,040
was this you can make a battery with

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,920
lithium a battery that as it turned out

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,640
had some commercial uses what uses Well

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,960
that took a bit of time to figure out I

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,240
think initially they're like thinking of

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,640
cell phones or thinking of little stuff

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,320
right even getting to work at all but by

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,360
about 2000 it became apparent that

35
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,439
actually you could make a car that used

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,960
a lithium ion battery and it would be

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,079
way better than a golf cart using lead

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,240
asid batteries for sure that's Bill

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,040
Green the director of the MIT energy

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,479
initiative and a chemical engineering

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,799
professor at MIT so people started to

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,320
think oh maybe this is a real thing and

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,200
some companies started manufacturing

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,560
them and you could buy them but the

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
performance was not as good as the

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,039
gasoline cars the cost was much higher

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,520
and so it was just a little niche thing

48
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,520
and not too long after it became clear

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,119
that yeah maybe you could use these

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,319
batteries for cars an American company

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,680
started that would eventually use

52
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:15,040
lithium ion batteries to power its

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,760
electric cars the company was founded in

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,599
2003 by two Engineers Mark tarpening and

55
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,000
Martin eard but they would eventually

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,680
leave and one of its most prolific

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,480
fundraisers Elon Musk ultimately became

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,280
its

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,440
CEO right around the time that musk

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,239
became CEO of Tesla in 2008 the US

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,480
Department of energy gave the company

62
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,120
nearly half a billion dollars in loans

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,879
to scale up this whole electric vehicle

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,040
thing you know the government hadn't

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,280
decided that this is what's going to

66
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,640
happen and it wasn't clear because

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,239
nobody knew what the real prices were

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,720
going to be in the future but anyway

69
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,120
they gave it a try and the Tesla example

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,400
worked out well also in China some

71
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,720
companies did a nice job making some

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,200
nice electric vehicles and once those

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,319
vehicles in the last decade those

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,920
vehicles started coming out and people

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,440
saw wow these actually do perform well

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,599
they do have good reliability

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
maintenance costs aren't too high and

78
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,840
this actually looks like it's really

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,879
going to happen and then you can see

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,799
once they get mass produced the costs

81
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,879
start going down because the engineers

82
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,959
figure out more and more clever ways to

83
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,120
manufacture them the supply chain gets

84
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,000
to be better for all everything needed

85
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,840
and so that's why by 2019 we actually

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,200
had a thing green says this is where the

87
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,640
rubber meets the road so to speak it

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,640
took a long some time about four decades

89
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,560
between the time that chemists realized

90
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,000
that you could use a form of lithium in

91
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,760
a battery and the time when you and I

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,239
started seeing a lot of Teslas and so

93
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,920
maybe more than 40 years from invention

94
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,040
to the full scale deployment that really

95
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,080
affects the climate that's the way it is

96
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,799
right now so I think you know everyone

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,959
involved we want it to happen faster

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,560
right we needed to be faster to meet our

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,360
Net Zero targets and so have to figure

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,360
out how can we make the steps faster all

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,640
the way on the chain that green thinks

102
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,879
is the work ahead of us that is the work

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,439
of the energy transition the move

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,560
towards cleaner sources of energy how do

105
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,040
we bring scientists and universities and

106
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,799
governments and Industry together to

107
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,479
make a 40-year process a little or maybe

108
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,639
a lot faster I think there's like a

109
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,120
systemic issue that at the beginning you

110
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,960
need a lot of different scientists and

111
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,520
Engineers trying to make the discoveries

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
and trying to find the manifestations of

113
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,039
them that really have a chance

114
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,919
to be practical affordable attractive to

115
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,440
people and then you need a lot of people

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,600
to work in the startup companies and

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
this in the early stages of a business

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
to develop it further and further to get

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
it to be really good and then you need

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,919
at some point there has to be a

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
consensus that this is what we're doing

122
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,720
and then the government policy will come

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,160
and really support the widespread

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,840
deployment because all sudden you scale

125
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,960
from you know millions and tens of

126
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,919
millions of dollars kind of scale to

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
hundreds of billions scale to make a

128
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,080
full scale deployment that's going to

129
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,680
affect the climate so that's really

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,440
massive investment decisions and so you

131
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,639
need to have very low risk on those big

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,160
decisions so you need the government to

133
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,520
be involved to sort of support the thing

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
coming in it has to be well demonstrated

135
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,160
people have to show that they like it so

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,919
it's really going to be a real Market

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,280
but once you reach that point things can

138
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
happen pretty fast because the big

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,000
investors then will come in because they

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,080
see oh there's a guaranteed way to make

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,199
some money and here's a side note we're

142
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,240
in a global race to produce cleaner

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,120
technology

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,319
faster and better you could say that's a

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,319
win-win for everybody but there are

146
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,240
downsides to the US falling behind which

147
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,400
might be happening in the realm of

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
electric

149
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,280
vehicles chines were willing to spend

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,440
real money on it I we all owe kind of a

151
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,680
debt to the Chinese government of taking

152
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,039
the early risk because it was not clear

153
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,880
when they started investing that it was

154
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,800
really going to work that well and going

155
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,440
to be attractive but they made a big bet

156
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,039
that that was going to happen I would

157
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,680
say that actually we similarly we owe

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,440
the German government a lot of kudos for

159
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,319
the development of solar cells they gave

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,280
a really big subsidy for photo voltaics

161
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
and that led to the development of

162
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,319
gigantic industry also mostly in China

163
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,520
but fundamentally that was being

164
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,960
supported by the German government to do

165
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,160
it and it came to the benefit of

166
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,039
everybody in the world that we now we

167
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,840
all have cheap solar sales and we're

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,919
going to need to come up with Greener

169
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,400
Alternatives for lots of industrial

170
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,800
processes like making cement and steel

171
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
and all the other things that make our

172
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,960
lives look the way they do but what if

173
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,560
China ends up scaling up all those

174
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,199
Technologies like they've done with

175
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,440
electric vehicles and solar cells Bill

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,919
Green says that might not be an optimal

177
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,120
solution I think as a researcher it's

178
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:48,440
super beneficial if there's

179
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,720
Manufacturing in your field in your

180
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,120
country so then you naturally have

181
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,840
people in your country who are working

182
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,199
on manufacturing stuff and if you're

183
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,680
trying to make an innovation that's

184
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,879
related to that manufacturing you can

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,599
have good Communications with the people

186
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,319
make the manufacturing and so I think

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,360
it's a shame that the foldable take

188
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,879
business all went to China I don't know

189
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,800
exactly the whole story about how that

190
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,520
happened but I think it was it's really

191
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,639
unfortunate because in the US we

192
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,080
actually had a lot of the key

193
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,360
researchers and we still do have a lot

194
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,599
of the key researchers in F Vol TX

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
having Manufacturing in the US means

196
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,240
that budding scientists and Engineers

197
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,120
can work more closely with companies

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,560
they can intern they can have speakers

199
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,400
from the companies come to their classes

200
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,479
in essence proximity matters and says

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,840
green no matter the country government

202
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:41,879
matters a lot if you just have the free

203
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,960
market it is not going to happen very

204
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,240
very slowly because fossil fuels are

205
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,520
cheap and there's no reason just

206
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,400
economically there's no reason to move

207
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,879
away from them it's completely because

208
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
we're trying to protect the climate

209
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,039
stabilize the climate that we're going

210
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,080
to do it therefore it's it's got to be

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,520
government regulation subsidies tax

212
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,479
have got to be driving it and government

213
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,280
investment research too normally when we

214
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,520
we have something that I don't know a

215
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,039
new um a new cell phone we don't feel

216
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,360
it's the government's role to play much

217
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,759
of a part in there they might have

218
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,039
actually supported some basic research

219
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,400
that led to some new kind of chip or

220
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,479
something but fundamentally it's mostly

221
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,759
the free market and it just moves at the

222
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,479
pace that the free market moves at and

223
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,800
how some people can make some money and

224
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,680
that's and and it works out for us

225
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,240
because we all get these nice cell

226
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,399
phones right but in this particular case

227
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,200
every year of delay is more years with

228
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,760
billions of tons of CO2 accumulating in

229
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,640
the atmosphere and the climate

230
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,080
changing and so it's it's a societal

231
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,240
need to move faster and so just working

232
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,760
the old way is not really appropriate

233
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,160
for the for this kind of innovation so

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,800
so yay for government yay for the

235
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,320
international you know CO2 reduction

236
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,959
process Paris agreement but you're

237
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,959
sitting here running an industrial

238
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,839
Consortium at MIT one that I used to run

239
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,480
it talk a little bit about how you see

240
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,200
its role and the RO of Industry yeah so

241
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,519
a very key part of this is at the end

242
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
there's somebody who's doing the

243
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,240
gigantic deployment at the hundreds of

244
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,760
billions of dollars scale to really make

245
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,040
climate impact that somebody is going to

246
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,120
be a company it's not going to be the

247
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,920
government providing you electricity or

248
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,600
selling you a car right somebody there's

249
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,880
going to be some gigantic Corporation

250
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,000
that's providing

251
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,600
reliably the new good that you get

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,320
that's now clean and working out all the

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
The Kinks that how to do that and so the

254
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,240
companies are definitely going to be

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,000
involved by the end and the MIT energy

256
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,079
initiative point of view is that we

257
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,160
should start from the beginning get the

258
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,120
companies involved helping to provide

259
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,000
some of the funding for the research

260
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
paying attention to the research as it's

261
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,640
going and starting to see early if

262
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,440
suppose we have somebody wants to do a

263
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,160
startup company maybe the big company

264
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,880
wants to keep in eye on it maybe they

265
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,079
want to make a small investment in it

266
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,720
then they might be ready to to take it

267
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,760
over and and scale it up when the thing

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,560
is really ready and I think that that's

269
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,519
a way we can help the whole thing along

270
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,600
also the students at MIT most of them

271
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,800
are going to go work for these companies

272
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,720
that are making these Innovations and so

273
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,079
it makes perfect sense for the companies

274
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,160
to be interested in the development of

275
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,399
their future Workforce and it makes

276
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,320
perfect sense for the MIT students to

277
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,399
want to try internships and try to check

278
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,839
check out these companies and see if

279
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
they want to work for them and so I

280
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,240
think there's like multiple reasons why

281
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,560
we should be working together on it and

282
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,519
the companies are trying you know at

283
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,519
least some of the companies are really

284
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
trying to make their best plan for how

285
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,440
they're going to do the transition they

286
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,839
have some amount of R&D capacity inside

287
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,480
the companies but most of them don't

288
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,800
have R&D capacity like MIT does and so

289
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,440
we can really help them with with pieces

290
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,920
where they don't have internal strength

291
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,160
or is a double check on their own

292
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,399
internal r&t and so I think there a lot

293
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,920
of ways that MIT can be beneficial to

294
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,360
them and of course the companies be

295
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,720
beneficial to MIT they help us to keep

296
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,160
focusing on problems that are real not

297
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,120
just academic problems but problems that

298
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,920
are really potentially going to have

299
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,079
real impact on the world and they can

300
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,279
provide some of the funding to make it

301
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,880
happen and so I think there's like a lot

302
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,160
of mutual benefit from working together

303
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,560
all right I have a couple questions one

304
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,440
is just about the role of big companies

305
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,639
so we talked about the role of

306
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,880
government in terms of like funding a

307
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,160
lab and getting the science started but

308
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,480
then you know we talked about the on

309
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,680
musk saying well this is kind of a small

310
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,839
company but going to fund this Factory

311
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,920
to see some Teslas roll off the line

312
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,920
here and what they look like and people

313
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,920
drive them and so on but it sounds like

314
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,079
you're saying but then when you get to

315
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,639
this point where you've

316
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:48,760
got something that you need to really

317
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:54,120
roll out at scale it's going to be an

318
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:56,320
apple or a Toyota or you know X on

319
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,600
mobile or whatever that's going to that

320
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,000
has billions of dollars and like the and

321
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,880
networks all over the world to be able

322
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,079
to actually do this yes yeah yeah

323
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,480
definitely okay so then this leads me to

324
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,079
my second question which is people who

325
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,079
run those companies are judged I mean

326
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,720
stocks trade every day you know all

327
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,160
those companies that I talked about are

328
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,360
traded um so you know they are focused

329
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,800
on quarterly earnings and earnings calls

330
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,920
and it seems to me that when you talk

331
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,720
even if you could compress a 45-year

332
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,199
Time transition like with EVS to 20

333
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,880
years or 15 years or whatever I mean you

334
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:38,639
you wouldn't be around as a CEO for

335
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,519
three years if you didn't produce so how

336
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,560
do you think how do people who run these

337
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,639
companies think about long time frames

338
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,560
when I mean their jobs are like on the

339
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,760
line all the time yeah this is really

340
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,680
difficult right the incentive structure

341
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,959
in many parts of our economy and in this

342
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,240
particular one are like often mismatched

343
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,360
with what the society really wants and I

344
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,199
see it with the companies I interact

345
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
with um that

346
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,160
some of the companies have decided

347
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,279
forget it I'm just going to run for the

348
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,519
maximum profit today I'm going to kill

349
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,360
my R&D Department I'm not going to worry

350
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,399
about the future and I'm just going to

351
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,399
run the assets I have today and maximize

352
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,079
the amount of money I get from them and

353
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,680
buy back the stock or whatever I can do

354
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,720
to make my stock option longterm people

355
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,279
this is the oil and gas industry well

356
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
oil and gas but not just oil and gas I

357
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,839
think all over and inside oil gas

358
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,440
there's a split so actually most of the

359
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,440
companies don't have R&D anymore and

360
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,040
basically that's the way they're

361
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,160
operating that're just're running down

362
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,360
our assets I think if you go to Coal

363
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,720
companies it's even more like this um

364
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,720
they don't they don't have research and

365
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,440
development to think like what is a new

366
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
product going to be right they basically

367
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
decide they're just going to cash out

368
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,279
the company when coal is no longer

369
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,160
nobody wants to buy coal anymore they're

370
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,839
going to close the company okay you're G

371
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,079
to stop exploring they'll drill till

372
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,720
they can drill or they'll mine till they

373
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,920
can not mine anymore and then they're

374
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,000
done okay they're done right and then

375
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,560
you know and they're just basically

376
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,399
cashing out the company and that's

377
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,720
that's one strategy but then there's

378
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,279
other companies the ones that come to

379
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,600
MIT to support research they typically

380
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,560
are still running R&D arms their idea is

381
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,000
we're going to still be a viable company

382
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,720
after our main product is no longer

383
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,399
bought by anybody and so we're going to

384
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,880
have a plan B plan a is we're making a

385
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
lot of money now it satisfies our

386
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,920
shareholders background plan is we're

387
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,680
making the plan B so that when we can't

388
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,519
do it that way we're going to have a new

389
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,320
product and we're going to still make a

390
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
lot of money with our new product and

391
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,360
we're going to be the supplier and we're

392
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,560
taking advantage that we have this huge

393
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,120
organization knows how to do gigantic

394
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,920
projects has a lot of cap a lot of cash

395
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,040
flow has a lot of Engineers and we think

396
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,720
that in the future there's going to be a

397
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,160
need for big projects that use a lot of

398
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,040
cash flow and need a lot of Engineers

399
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,199
and so we'll be ready to be the supplier

400
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,800
for that and they're trying to explore

401
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,360
like how can we actually monetize our

402
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,199
capacity our abilities that we have in

403
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,880
the company but instead of selling Oil

404
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,120
we're going to sell CO2 sequestration or

405
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,360
we're going to sell hydrogen or you you

406
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,160
know they have a lot of different ideas

407
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,440
of what they want to do and um and the

408
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,279
different companies are all making

409
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,440
different decisions about this because

410
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,240
partly as you said the CEO incentives

411
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,480
are not that well aligned with the

412
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,360
long-term stuff so it's almost like that

413
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,800
the cios make their own decision kind of

414
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,560
free actually from the stakeholder

415
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,839
pressures because most of the

416
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,279
shareholders just care about they get

417
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,240
the dividend and the stock price goes up

418
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,839
right but a lot of the CEOs feel some

419
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,839
obligation to keep the company together

420
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,199
as a viable concern they're proud of

421
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,440
their company they have a lot of their

422
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,199
friends or employees there and they want

423
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,000
it to be a Running Company and and they

424
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,040
want uh they have grandchildren too and

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,560
they want the climate problem to be

426
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,680
solved and so a bunch of them are

427
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,480
putting money into trying to find how

428
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,560
that can

429
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,360
happen those companies have a lot of

430
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,120
capacity so if they really do it they

431
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,480
can be very very beneficial at speeding

432
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
up the timelines you know the the the

433
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,959
deployment if you had to start from a

434
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,079
startup I have a little startup if my

435
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,720
little startup with it six employees has

436
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,480
to somehow replace you know 10 billion

437
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
tons of CO2 per year it's like there's

438
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,519
no way right it's like you know we're

439
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,199
struggling just to raise $10 million I

440
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
had to raise a hundred billion that's

441
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,160
like a completely different thing right

442
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,959
and so um if we had to wait for me it's

443
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,720
going to be more than 40 years before my

444
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,560
small company can solve the the world's

445
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,319
problems but the big companies if one of

446
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,399
the big companies decides oh I can see I

447
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,199
can make some money doing this

448
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,279
environmentally beneficial thing they

449
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,560
can scale it like in one year to you

450
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,800
know gigantic scale that that a small

451
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,319
company could almost never do and so I

452
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,440
think I think we have to hope that some

453
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,319
of the big companies are really going to

454
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,199
do that it's also important that that in

455
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:40,120
the US we have most of the companies are

456
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,560
shareholder controlled but around the

457
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,480
world a lot of the energy companies are

458
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,399
actually controlled by the governments

459
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,519
that they're located in and the

460
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,279
governments have a very complicated set

461
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,639
of

462
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,240
stakeholders and they their citizens

463
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,440
many of them want climate change to be

464
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,440
on the agenda and so those companies

465
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,560
face a different pressures um and so in

466
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,360
in some countries the same company that

467
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,400
drills for oil is also the same company

468
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,520
that puts in the Solar Vol photovoltaics

469
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,480
it's putting in the electric vehicle

470
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,000
Chargers they're putting in the

471
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,039
windmills they're doing the whole thing

472
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,400
the the government says you're our

473
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,600
Energy company do everything we want and

474
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,319
and that's what they're doing and I

475
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,640
think putting all the companies together

476
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,079
in one pot and thinking they're all the

477
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,640
same I think is really not accurate at

478
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,480
all yeah I think that's a really good

479
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,439
point but among those companies whose

480
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,960
whose capital budgets are stressed

481
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,480
because they're being pushed into these

482
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,919
other areas the BPS and the shells the

483
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Ecco

484
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,440
patrols their exploration budgets are

485
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,120
declining yes and so there sort of

486
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,799
facing a future in which they can't be

487
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,480
oil and gas companies

488
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,600
anymore is that because is that because

489
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,799
like of well they have to acquire

490
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,200
somebody

491
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,320
else's Assets in order to be able to

492
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,559
continue producing because they'll

493
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,440
eventually exhaust their their proven

494
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,679
resources it's just that's just because

495
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,400
they're getting to the end of how much

496
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,640
oil is in those Wells yeah they spend a

497
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,880
lot of money every year looking for more

498
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,679
and figuring out ways to get at oil that

499
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,840
maybe at depth or maybe under the under

500
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,960
under a part of the ocean that's

501
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,280
inaccessible or the North uh in areas

502
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
that are inaccessible trying to figure

503
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,640
out how to get it you're quite right I

504
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
mean in some of these companies there's

505
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,919
certain amount of research going on

506
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,400
still that pushes those those boundaries

507
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,840
but in others there's retrenchment on

508
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,159
the one hand it's you know yay yay for

509
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,600
renewable energies and the energy

510
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,760
transition on the other hand it's like

511
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,320
oh my God we could get to a point where

512
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,440
we either don't have enough of those

513
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,880
things to continue running the economy

514
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,360
as we run it now and we Face higher

515
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,520
prices and maybe a big economic

516
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,159
downturn or something's going to have to

517
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,080
happen on the renewable side to enable

518
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,880
transition actually the very tricky

519
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,520
thing of the transition is that we all

520
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,120
want to still have transportation we all

521
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,039
want to still be able to get an airplane

522
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,880
and go for a vacation we all want

523
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:01,440
electricity come in our house and so

524
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,360
that's actually a higher want than our

525
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,320
want for a clean climate right and so

526
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,720
however we do the energy transition it

527
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,840
has to continue to reliably provide all

528
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,480
those services that everybody relies on

529
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,360
and in fact you could kill people if if

530
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,240
you screw it up you know if all a sudden

531
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,360
you ban the trucks and nobody can bring

532
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,159
the food from the farms you could have a

533
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,360
famine it's a lot of bad things could

534
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,240
happen this makes it super tricky

535
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,240
because it's like we have to maintain

536
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,360
the exist existing fossil fuel based uh

537
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,840
infrastructure and at the same time

538
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,000
build the new infrastructure that's

539
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,360
going to replace it and then of course

540
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,039
from the point of view people who own

541
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,960
the different things the economic pros

542
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:45,039
and cons can be wildly crazy right that

543
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,200
you know that the from the point of view

544
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,120
of the consumers of electricity in

545
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
Illinois you really might want to have a

546
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,159
lot of solar cells they have plenty of

547
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,480
land there and you can put a lot of phot

548
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,520
voltaics out it might be really great

549
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,360
for cleaning up the environment but then

550
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,400
the utilities might also own Some Coal

551
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,240
power plants and they're like oh my

552
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,120
goodness

553
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,600
we're we're losing our Capital asset we

554
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,120
have to spend all this extra Capital by

555
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,440
these solar cells and so they're like

556
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,679
well then we want to raise the rates but

557
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,600
then the the citizens of Illinois might

558
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,880
say wow I don't want to pay so much

559
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,720
money for electricity so there's like a

560
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,720
lot of conflicts and I think it's the

561
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,919
companies are have internal conflicts

562
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,240
between the incumbent technology and

563
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,360
bringing the new one and each of us as

564
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,159
consumers have a conflict between that

565
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,480
we're basically using fossil fuel

566
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,679
technology now and we want to make sure

567
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,880
we keep on getting the goods that we

568
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,880
want but also want the transition to

569
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,679
happen the only way we can conquer this

570
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,640
is we have to do it together as a

571
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,320
collective action that a society has to

572
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,880
say this is what we're doing we're going

573
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,760
to make regulations and taxes to make

574
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,240
sure that we satisfy all these needs of

575
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,080
maintaining the services that we need

576
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,760
and at the same time cleaning them up

577
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,919
and providing the the resources needed

578
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,000
to make that really happen if we just

579
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,880
say it's going to happen and we don't

580
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,280
actually put the resources in it's not

581
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,640
really going to happen it's just a

582
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,240
statement and and if we make regulations

583
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,940
that shut things down before we have the

584
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:08,819
replacement there's going to be like

585
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:08,819
[Music]

586
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,000
chaos so Bill you you had talked before

587
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:18,799
about this but in many ways you know you

588
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,640
kind of bring together uh companies and

589
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:25,559
Academia and people in government and

590
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,679
you talked about the need for a higher

591
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,000
level of urgency than we had when we

592
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,200
were going through the EV transition do

593
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,159
you really sense that people have that

594
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,600
level of urgency or maybe it needs to be

595
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,559
even higher I think the political will

596
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,960
actually I saw polling from Republican

597
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,240
party people that the political will on

598
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,760
both sides of the aisle in the United

599
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,600
States is in favor of cleaning up the

600
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,960
climate and if you go around the world

601
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,000
that's why all the countries support the

602
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,480
Paris agreement even a bunch of

603
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,240
countries that you know autocrats in

604
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,400
charge they still signed on because they

605
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,279
know their citizens really want the

606
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,320
climate to be stabilized right and also

607
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,360
they see the problems they're going to

608
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,440
have famines they're going to have

609
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,240
floods they're going to have all kinds

610
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,039
of trouble so they can see like it's

611
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,520
really better for our country to to

612
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,640
support the Paris agreement so there's

613
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,240
agreement at that level I think it's

614
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,559
when you get down to the nitty-gritty of

615
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,679
you know who's paying exactly for this

616
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,360
and how inconvenient is for me um that

617
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,159
then you you'll have people start to

618
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,120
resist and and for people who lose their

619
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,760
jobs it's even more extreme right if you

620
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
say well sorry the coal mines are closed

621
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
um all the people in the coal mining

622
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,240
town are going to be really mad right

623
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,919
and so we have to figure out how do we

624
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,919
you know help to compensate people how

625
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,880
to to cover how to make this the whole

626
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,159
transition work but I think the same we

627
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,159
have the same problem in Many Things Not

628
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,480
Just Energy so housing is a big thing

629
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,200
for Boston area right if you talk to

630
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,520
anybody for for the US I would say

631
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,760
housing shortage is really c yeah so

632
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,440
from one point of view you can say I

633
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,600
think if you ask people do you think we

634
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,640
should have more housing the rent should

635
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,880
be lower I think it'd be like 90% of

636
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,480
people say yes right then you say okay

637
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,640
will you allow the lot on the corner

638
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,720
there to become an apartment building

639
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
instead of being a couple small houses

640
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
and most people in the town say no it's

641
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,559
be ugly I hate apartment buildings right

642
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,120
okay so it's it's the same kind of thing

643
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,440
it's like that the we agree in principle

644
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,400
that there's a problem and we need to

645
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,679
address it but then when people propose

646
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,000
specific

647
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,159
Solutions uh people have resistance and

648
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,120
I think in the energy space where you

649
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,080
see it a lot is about cost so that if

650
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,679
the replacement is cheap enough we're

651
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,559
cool with it so no I didn't hear anybody

652
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,559
really complain about the switch of from

653
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,840
incandescent light bulbs to LED light

654
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,120
bulbs you have to be like a crank to

655
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,200
complain about that there were some

656
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,760
cranks there were some cranks okay there

657
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,240
always are I mean um uh but you know if

658
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,559
if you go to EVS now you hear people a

659
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,120
little bit more resistant part of it is

660
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,799
that the EVS are more expensive right

661
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,279
now and and it's going to take some

662
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,400
public money to put in public Chargers

663
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:55,679
and stuff like that but uh I think that

664
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,919
that as the price of the EVS go down

665
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,039
you're going to see people that today

666
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,159
would say I'll never buy an EV if the EV

667
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,360
is $5,000 cheaper and you and you don't

668
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,120
have to BU pay for gas then I think a

669
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,159
lot of people might say ah I guess I'll

670
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,880
you know I said I wasn't going to buy an

671
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,000
EV but I think I'm G to buy it now right

672
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,360
so I think the price is a key part and

673
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,159
it's the same thing why we have the coal

674
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,440
power plants is 100% an economic thing

675
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,640
right and and so if we can get the

676
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,039
prices of the new technologies to be

677
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,919
close enough then it's much easier to

678
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,320
convince people to go along with the

679
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,799
change and so you know the engineers and

680
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
the and the industry guys have a lot of

681
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,039
work to do to try to get the

682
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,000
Technologies to be affordable reliable

683
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:37,200
practical not annoying to use um so then

684
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,320
then the society will say okay that

685
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,880
sounds great and then once the society

686
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,880
says it's fine then the government

687
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,720
Regulators are happy to come in and make

688
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,840
it and require it because it's like uh

689
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,880
it's requiring what people want anyway

690
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,000
yeah I mean there these heroic things

691
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,360
that that are going to happen in the

692
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,679
future I think you know things like

693
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,080
fusion and you know I'm I'm all for them

694
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:01,039
and it's exciting and very much worth

695
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,440
funding but if you can delay that time

696
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
until we absolutely need them and until

697
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,559
we need to start spending money on

698
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,080
adaptation that is you

699
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,840
know changing changing where people live

700
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,440
changing you know

701
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,360
coastlines enormous expenditures that

702
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,440
we're going to have to make if you can

703
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,600
delay that uh it it's a much much

704
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,520
cheaper much safer transition and so you

705
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,960
know I'm really much in favor of of

706
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,039
doing more I think toward incremental

707
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,720
very near term things than I think

708
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:34,720
probably probably we're we're doing

709
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,919
right now yeah if you were you know

710
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,039
optimistically thinking here's how I

711
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,200
would script this scenario of who needs

712
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,880
to work together and how they need to do

713
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,480
it what would happen well it's not

714
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,520
happening like right this second okay so

715
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,600
I think there's a separation we have

716
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,159
some technologies that are really ready

717
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,559
and it's it's all about doing the

718
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,600
deployment and working out some details

719
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,480
about the regulations and so you know

720
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,399
photovoltaics and windmills for

721
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,039
electricity is really ready okay and

722
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:09,399
it's but it's like you know it's like

723
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:11,120
zoning and permits for power lines and

724
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:14,000
you know and details about who's going

725
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,960
to how exactly we're going to handle the

726
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,960
uh intermittency of the electrical power

727
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,600
so there there's definitely things to

728
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,760
work on there but it's like it's like

729
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,080
more like you just put some money on it

730
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,159
you say this is the policy we're doing

731
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,080
it it could really happen more solar

732
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,840
cells more windmills and I think the EV

733
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,919
is it's very much like that too it's

734
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,679
like the EV deployment we're doing now

735
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,240
is going to work great for people who

736
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,760
have their own garage or their own

737
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,840
driveway and they can put their own

738
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,000
charger in and that's I think we're

739
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,360
already on the way that that's just

740
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,640
going to happen and you don't have to do

741
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,200
anything but if we want to get them in

742
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,480
for all the apartment buildings and

743
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,720
condos and we want to you know help

744
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,640
people who can't afford the capital cost

745
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,120
and we're going to make sure enough

746
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,360
Chargers are on the highway so people

747
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,000
are happy to use them that that that's

748
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,000
some more money is gonna be needed and

749
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,320
it's GNA you know so there's like a A

750
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,279
Part B of the EV roll out but again it's

751
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,520
like we know what to do it's like just

752
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,399
getting people to do it right then

753
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,320
there's other ones like are those people

754
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,360
in the government or are those people in

755
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,159
companies well if the companies have to

756
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,760
do it the government if they set the

757
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,320
regulation the incentives right up the

758
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,440
the the free market will do it because

759
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,000
the technology exists but if they don't

760
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,360
do it the companies are not in a

761
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,799
business to make a loss they're not

762
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,200
gonna they're not going to do it so you

763
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,240
can see with the charger companies right

764
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,919
now that the the setup doesn't really

765
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,399
encourage them they don't make any money

766
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,279
on Chargers and therefore they're not

767
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,720
putting any more Chargers in and it's

768
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,559
like somehow they've got to the

769
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,520
rules so that somebody can make some

770
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,080
money running the Chargers and then

771
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,440
they'll put them in okay now partly it's

772
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,200
like as more EVS come in there'll be

773
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,039
more demand for the Chargers and that

774
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,600
will help them make some money but I

775
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,600
think it's probably needs some

776
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,360
examination about what the rules are for

777
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,679
the Chargers to make it work and

778
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,600
similarly for apartment buildings you

779
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,159
have to figure out what the heck the

780
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,480
rules are about who puts a charger in

781
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,120
the parking lot and uh I I have no idea

782
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,559
but

783
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,919
it's legislature or the Town Council

784
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,120
whoever's in charge of it's got to start

785
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,840
working on it because it's going to be

786
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,240
like on your doorstep you know four

787
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,519
years from now and ideally you have the

788
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,720
solution already worked out and you've

789
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:11,880
already discussed it with all the

790
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,440
neighbors and it's all ready to go and

791
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,880
if you don't it could be 10 years in the

792
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,440
courts but then we have other

793
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,720
Technologies we we don't have solutions

794
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,320
for so I'm working right now on ethylene

795
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
um trying to figure out how we can

796
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,320
replace the process that we use to make

797
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,240
ethylene so there's many materials that

798
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,159
we use high temperature heat right now

799
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,039
to make them so cement steel certain

800
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,200
types of plastics a a bunch of things

801
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,440
and right now we don't really have a

802
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,200
comparably cost solution for providing

803
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,360
that heat so right now people do it with

804
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,880
natural gas or with coal it's super

805
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,440
cheap to provide high temperature heat

806
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,760
burning some coal burning some natural

807
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,799
gas but if you're going to switch to

808
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,360
some other way all the ways we have

809
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,039
right now are too expensive or or

810
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,480
considerably more expensive so you'd

811
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,399
have to use very strong government

812
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,039
regulation to force people to switch or

813
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,399
we have to invent technology that's more

814
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,519
affordable so that's one where we're at

815
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:03,679
still at the point where the engineers

816
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,360
have to figure out like do we have a

817
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,519
real solution here that can work um can

818
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,679
we demonstrate it convince the industry

819
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,960
that this is going to work and then if

820
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,399
you can convince them you get some demos

821
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,640
then the government might feel like I

822
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,000
can impose the regulation you have to do

823
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,600
it but if it's not demonstrated they're

824
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,360
not going to force the industry to

825
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,159
change um so I think we have a split and

826
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,279
and you can look through all the

827
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,640
different Technologies of where we are

828
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,399
and some of them really need University

829
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,679
Research at the the scientists some of

830
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:33,559
them need some Engineers maybe maybe

831
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,600
University maybe National Lab maybe some

832
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:38,919
company guys but better coordination

833
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,320
better funding to really push it along

834
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:44,519
um and uh so I'm I'm very optimistic

835
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,600
about the ones where we already have the

836
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,519
technology in hand and um some of the

837
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,559
other Technologies I can see that we're

838
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,440
making good progress and I'm optimistic

839
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,720
about them and there's some of them

840
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,399
where we just need a lot more work to

841
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,679
get there this problem is being

842
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:01,120
approached systematically I mean just

843
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,960
for the benefit of our listeners I mean

844
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,080
it's not sort of

845
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
hopeless I was wondering that when you

846
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,240
said like oh we need a lot of heat to

847
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,159
make steel and so on um are like

848
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,279
scientists all over the place um have

849
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,880
they been sort of deployed to deal with

850
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,399
this or is it just like well if you're

851
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,399
interested go go check it out but you

852
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:26,000
know so so in steel for example the the

853
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,200
companies are super interested okay um

854
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,559
and so they're they have their is

855
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,840
working like crazy to try to find it

856
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,039
like a lot of Steel banking companies

857
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,519
are still in Europe and they got very

858
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,799
strict regulations coming down the pike

859
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,399
and they got to do something so they're

860
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,120
really motivated and we have University

861
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,080
researchers who see it but there's a lot

862
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,679
more obscure industrial processes that

863
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,279
don't have a big constituency for them

864
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,519
that are all still going to need

865
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,840
attention um they need cheerleaders to

866
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:51,360
be like how about this industrial

867
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,279
process can we make it better yeah

868
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,640
exactly and they need you know some

869
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,519
funding stream to support them to work

870
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,360
on it often you need the industry to be

871
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,159
involved to even teach you about the

872
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,960
process you know what you're really

873
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,000
working on and we you know at Mighty

874
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,039
we've done some of that but I think

875
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,240
there's a lot more opportunities for

876
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,000
doing that part of it is we need the

877
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,360
connections with the right companies and

878
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,600
the companies had to be motivated to

879
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,240
work on that process some of it we need

880
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,840
to teach the government people about the

881
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,440
different processes so they'll they'll

882
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,360
decide to make some funding streams

883
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,159
available to work on them but but I

884
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,440
think it's it's it's possible to do it

885
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,960
it's not and and the big ones of Steel

886
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,039
and cement for example they two of the

887
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,279
biggest there's already quite big

888
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:34,399
efforts I think for steel people have a

889
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,799
pretty good idea how to do it I'm not so

890
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,840
sure about the story about cement but

891
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,480
they're they're definitely working in

892
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,679
the lab at MIT on it and there's some

893
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,880
startup companies trying to do it people

894
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,000
want it to be simple you know they want

895
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,919
the silver bullet and it's going to

896
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
solve all the problems and I'm sorry

897
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,639
it's just that's not the way the world

898
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,639
is the world's complicated and you know

899
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,919
it's our economy is complicated there's

900
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:54,440
a ton of companies and a ton of people

901
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,200
doing different jobs all over the world

902
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,200
and basically almost every company and

903
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
every job and every person is being

904
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,080
affected by this change and of course

905
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,760
it's complicated and so I think I think

906
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,399
we should just embrace it it is

907
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,559
complicated and we have a lot of smart

908
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,360
people to work on it and we just need to

909
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,720
you know smooth things out and make that

910
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,039
that work more efficient so we can make

911
