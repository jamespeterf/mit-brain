1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,880
All right, good morning everybody.

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,519
Welcome to the MPG primer. I hope you

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,719
had a good two weeks off and enjoyed

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,760
ASHG if you attended. I'm really excited

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,680
to introduce um Ben Fernander. He is a

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,439
fifth year PhD candidate in Chris

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,920
Walsh's lab at Boston Children's

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,400
Hospital. He studies somatic mutations

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,560
and neurop fibromyitosis type one and

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,359
prenatal somatic mutations associated

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,120
with maternal infection. He is also a

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,880
prolific STEM teacher which you'll see

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,600
today and mentor throughout the whole

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,520
Boston area. And outside of his amazing

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,160
research, he also loves to travel and

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,320
hike which is great. So Ben, thank you.

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,320
Um ask questions throughout and yeah.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
>> All right. Good morning everybody.

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,000
Thanks for coming to this primer. I'm

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,719
really excited to be here. Um, and thank

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,199
you for the wonderful introduction. So,

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,000
who here studies germline mutations?

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,360
Show of hands. Most people, anyone

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,280
studies somatic mutations?

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
What? Okay, I'm excited. I have some

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,799
family here. So, today my goal is going

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,680
to be to tell you how not just germline

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,400
mutations impact human health, but also

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,439
somatic mutations. So what I've got up

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,439
here is a diagram of how many cells can

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,040
be impacted by a sematic mutation

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,439
depending on when they happen during

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,680
development. So there's two main ways

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,680
that we're going to start out talking

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,479
about how sematic mutations can have an

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,759
impact. And one way is if they happen

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,759
really early on in development. So we

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,680
start out as a zygote. We have one copy

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,520
of the genome. We replicate that DNA

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,560
over and over and over and over again.

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,840
And we mostly do a very very good job.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,520
But we're not perfect. So if we have a

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,320
mistake that happens soon after

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,399
fertilization before gastrolation, we

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
might introduce a sematic mutation

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,640
that's present in the brain, in the

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,399
lungs, and the hearts. If however it

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
happens later, maybe around the

49
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,479
formation of the neural tube, then we'll

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,520
have a sematic mutation that's just

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,200
present in the brain. And as we go on

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
through the weeks of development, we

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,120
might have a sematic mutation that would

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
only impact one hemisphere or part of

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,800
one hemisphere or maybe even just a

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,800
focal region of the brain. So what I'm

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
showing you here is that sematic

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,360
mutations during development impact more

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,440
cells the earlier they happen. The other

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
way that sematic mutations can have a

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,280
big impact,

62
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,280
but point it this way.

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Oh.

64
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,519
Oh, just click it.

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,319
Yeah.

66
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:55,200
Oh, it's not even clicking here either.

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,800
>> See if I can click around. If I do that

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,760
and then I do this. Here we are. Okay,

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
we're good. So, I mentioned

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,760
developmental sematic mutations. The

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,319
more popular example of sematic

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,480
mutations is in tumors. And this is

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,560
really illustrative of the second way

74
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,680
that sematic mutations can have a really

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,400
big impact. So we're familiar with the

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,120
idea that we could have a tumor

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,360
initiation mutation in a regular cell

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,120
that increases its ability to

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,519
proliferate quickly. And as that

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
massively proliferative cell continues

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,319
proliferating, it will accumulate

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,640
additional mutations, some of which are

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,680
also driver mutations that increase its

84
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,360
proliferative capacity further. So what

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
we're seeing in this graph here is that

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
over time on the x-axis, the cell

87
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
accumulates more mutations and those

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,519
mutations that increase its ability to

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,480
proliferate form larger clones.

90
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
So we have this idea that in development

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,799
sematic mutations can have an impact by

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,360
happening earlier and we can also have

93
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,760
impactful sematic mutations if they

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,760
increase the ability of a cell to

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,760
proliferate.

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,519
But what about sematic mutations that

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,840
don't cause cancer? Right? We're pretty

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,920
familiar with this idea that cancer is

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,439
bad for our health and that a cell

100
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,239
proliferating out of control is a

101
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,320
concern. But are there other cases where

102
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,120
sematic mutations can impact the

103
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,280
function of our bodily systems? And to

104
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
get into how our lab started studying

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,800
this question, I'm going to give you a

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,479
little quick history lesson of what our

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,720
lab has done. So our lab's been around

108
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,040
for a while. This is like ye old recipe

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
for a paper in the Walsh lab, right?

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,240
We're very interested in how the brain

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,320
is formed and also malf forations. So

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,720
what we classically will do is we'll

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,600
identify patients who have a specific

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,400
brain malf for and then we'll look in

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,720
the DNA by looking at blood consented to

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,120
be used from that patient and we'll look

117
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
for a mutation that's suspicious put

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,040
that mutation either into cells or into

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,120
a mouse or even a ferret if we need a

120
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,840
folded brain to study it and we'll try

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,440
to create a mechanistic model. So we've

122
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
been doing this for a long time and I'm

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
going to give you just one example to

124
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,960
illustrate our point here on a paper

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,800
that I was actually able to contribute

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,639
to. So this is poly micro gyria. If we

127
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,880
know our Latin roots, we can figure out

128
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,400
that this means many small folds. So

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,080
there's supposed to be a bunch of folds

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,160
in our brain to increase surface area

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,000
and contact between the neurons. But

132
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,039
what happens in these individuals is

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,560
there are too many folds. And because

134
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,880
there's so many of them, they're all

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
very small. And these individuals have

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,680
reduced intellectual capacity along with

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,840
other cognitive symptoms.

138
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
So we did what we said we would do and

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
we looked in these individuals. We

140
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,600
looked in their blood and we found some

141
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,600
suspicious variants in a gene called

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
TM161B.

143
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
So you look at the family tree, you look

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
at the pedigree, you see who has

145
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
polyicrogya,

146
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,440
who has these mutations, you see it all

147
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,680
is concordant with this idea that

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,919
variance in this gene might be causing

149
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,199
this disease. And then we go and put

150
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,800
this mutation into a mouse and we look

151
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,280
at the brain to see if there's anything

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,680
suspicious. And to skip to the punch

153
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,000
line, we found something very

154
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,160
interesting.

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,080
So this is what the apical surface of

156
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,680
the developing mouse brain might look

157
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,720
like if you take a serial electron

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,199
microraph. And you see these antennaike

159
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
structures sticking out out of all of

160
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,639
these cells. And they look like antennas

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,440
because they pretty much are antennas.

162
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,919
These are primary psyia and their job is

163
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,039
to detect morphagens that tell the cell

164
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,880
what to develop into. So if there's some

165
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,319
kind of gradient, for example, Sonic

166
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,199
Hedgehog, this organel is going to

167
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,759
detect that. [clears throat] And when we

168
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,560
mutate T-M161B,

169
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,120
those cellular antenna are all kinds of

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,599
messed up. They're blebed out here.

171
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,520
There's lots of debris floating around.

172
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,400
And this is consistent with the idea

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,919
that this gene and mutations in it are

174
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,319
important for how the brain develops.

175
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,039
So this is just one example of an

176
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,440
example we found of a brain malf for a

177
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,840
patient variant and a mechanistic model.

178
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,160
We've done this many many times across

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
many different classes of genes. We've

180
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,240
looked at genes that regulate neural

181
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,319
stem cell proliferation, neuronal

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,919
migration, differentiation, and even

183
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,400
neuronal function. And all using this

184
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,039
same pipeline of looking at a brain malf

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,800
for sequencing the DNA found in the

186
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,280
blood and then modeling it in the

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
appropriate system. And you could

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,759
probably guess that it did not always go

189
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,680
so smoothly. And that's when the focus

190
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,800
of our lab started to evolve a little

191
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,560
bit. We thought we could do the same

192
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,479
thing with another brain malf for hemi

193
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
megalen.

194
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,520
And we can play with the Latin roots

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,879
again and see that what we're talking

196
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,680
about here is half of the brain is too

197
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,080
big. You see on the right side here we

198
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,319
have our nice cortical folds. On the

199
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,039
left side it's all bulging out. It's

200
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,680
pressing up against the skull. This is

201
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,199
hemgal and sephilate.

202
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
And we did the normal thing. We went

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
into the blood of some patients and we

204
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,919
sequenced looking for exonic mutations

205
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,560
that might be suspicious and we didn't

206
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,039
find any,

207
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
at least not in the blood. And we're

208
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,279
geneticists, so we understand that

209
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,039
genetics are indeed the cause of

210
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,599
absolutely everything. So this doesn't

211
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,399
make any sense, right? This has to be

212
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,399
some kind of genetic cause. So we dug a

213
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,560
little bit deeper and instead of looking

214
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,360
at the blood in the and the DNA in the

215
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,080
blood I should say we looked at the DNA

216
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,200
in the brain and that's when we started

217
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,160
to see something interesting.

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,279
So this is a very old style plot. This

219
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,399
is a Sanger sequencing plot of the part

220
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,839
of the gene AKT3 which is in the mtor

221
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,440
pathway where we found something

222
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,519
suspicious. So we see these peaks here

223
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,480
indicating that the sequence of this

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,959
gene is what we expect it to be. But in

225
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,480
this particular location, we don't see

226
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,320
one peak in this site. We see two

227
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,120
indicating that in the brain there are

228
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,360
some cells with the mutation. This

229
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,399
adinine residue is not what we expect to

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,320
see in the sequence of this gene.

231
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
So if we look at the blood, this is

232
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
where we look first. We don't see this

233
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,440
mutation. It's just the guanine residue.

234
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,959
And in the brain, we have two different

235
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,440
clones. 17% of the clones have this

236
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,720
adinine residue. The rest of them have

237
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,720
the correct guanine residue.

238
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
So now we have some evidence that it's

239
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
not a germline mutation associated with

240
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,279
hemalincense.

241
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,560
It's a sematic mutation just impacting

242
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,320
part of the brain.

243
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
And this makes sense if you think about

244
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,800
this image again, right? When we see

245
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,519
hemiggal and sephille, we don't see the

246
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,560
whole brain affected. We just see part

247
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,800
of it. So in this case, we have a

248
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,279
mutation that probably occurred sometime

249
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,959
around here during cortical neurogenesis

250
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,240
and ended up impacting just parts of the

251
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,519
brain. It's now understood that

252
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,600
hemalincense is a disease whereas you

253
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,560
have a larger mutational load. you have

254
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,480
a larger part of the re of the brain in

255
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,200
um affected I should say. So we have a

256
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,120
later mutation the mutational load is

257
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,600
going to be low the amount of the brain

258
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,000
affected is going to be low and then as

259
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,959
you get earlier and earlier mutations in

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,120
genes like AKT3 you have a larger

261
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:56,560
portion of the brain affected

262
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,360
and it's not just hemgalencil

263
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,000
that's like this. This is called

264
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,519
Proteius syndrome. It's literally a one

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
ina- million disease. It's very

266
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,399
difficult to diagnose because it's so

267
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,640
rare. But it is also a disease caused by

268
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:16,720
sematic mutation E17K specifically also

269
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,640
in an AKT gene in the mTor pathway. So

270
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,560
you could see here that this individual

271
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,800
unfortunately had some of these sematic

272
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,040
mutations in some bone and we see a

273
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,240
massive overgrowth of the jaw and even

274
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,240
the nose area. But depending on where

275
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,920
this mutation happens, these might be in

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,959
the feet, these might be in the hands,

277
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,600
it could be anywhere in the body. But in

278
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,480
general, we see that this pattern of

279
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
sematic mutations impacting health when

280
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
they happen during development is

281
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,560
consistent across a few different

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,680
examples.

283
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,040
So one question you might have is, okay,

284
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
if I made it all the way through the

285
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,200
process of development, right, I am a

286
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
fully grown adult now. I'm done building

287
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
my brain. and all those neurons are

288
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,720
ready to go. Am I safe? The answer is

289
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,640
no. So, it's not just cancer either, but

290
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,120
there are also sematic mutations that

291
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,680
can build up in proliferative cells in

292
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,440
the body. So, what I'm going to tell you

293
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,480
about now is clonal hematopoesis of

294
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,079
indeterminate potential or chip

295
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,000
mutations.

296
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,680
So when we're talking about clonal, what

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,519
we're saying is that these mutations

298
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
ultimately become part of a larger group

299
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,200
of cells that all harbor the mutation

300
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
because they're proliferative. We're

301
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,920
talking about hematopoesis, so we're

302
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,639
talking about blood stem cells. And then

303
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,160
indeterminate potential is the key word

304
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,079
here. So these mutations do have an

305
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,200
effect on growth, but they're not

306
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,120
immediately causing cancer. their

307
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
potential for proliferation is

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,399
indeterminate.

309
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,079
Right? So we have blood stem cells. We

310
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,600
have a nice pool of blood stem cells to

311
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,399
regenerate all the blood cells that we

312
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,440
need for our body. As aging progresses,

313
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,000
we may have the formation of a chip

314
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,519
mutation shown in purple here, right? Or

315
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,560
a non-chip mutation shown in brown. And

316
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,360
then those cells with the chip mutation

317
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,360
will become a larger proportion of the

318
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
cells as time goes on. They have an

319
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,760
increased ability to proliferate. They

320
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,000
start to out compete. So this makes

321
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
sense in a theoretical context. But how

322
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,200
important is this, right? How many

323
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,399
people have chip? And it turns out it's

324
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,399
about 10% of the people over age 70 have

325
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
this in their blood. So this is

326
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,880
something that impacts a lot of people.

327
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,839
A lot of people have chip mutations

328
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,600
ready to go right now in their blood.

329
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,160
And the question is what happens?

330
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,160
So just to skip to the bottom right, the

331
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,320
first thing we think of is cancer. And

332
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,360
that does happen more frequently in

333
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,320
individuals with CHIP, but it's less

334
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,360
than 1% per year. That's not the main

335
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,920
outcome of people having chip mutations.

336
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,000
the more um important risk is in heart

337
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,600
failure, thrombosis and accelerated

338
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,920
atherosclerosis.

339
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,399
Individuals with CHIP have a 40%

340
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,959
increase in risk for diagnosis of

341
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,360
cardiovascular disease.

342
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,519
So how does that happen? Right? The

343
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
thinking is that if we have some kind of

344
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,800
mutagenic events leading to a clonal

345
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,600
expansion and a chip mutation that those

346
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,000
cells with the chip mutation, especially

347
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,720
when they form a larger clone, are more

348
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,959
likely to cause inflammation. And

349
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,120
inflammation can be bad for a lot of

350
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,800
different reasons, but especially for

351
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,000
the function of the heart and for

352
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,040
clogging of important arteries.

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,680
So if you look at individuals with chip

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,800
mutations, not just those with heart

355
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,639
failure, but those without any coronary

356
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,639
heart disease, we see that the

357
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,480
calcification

358
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,360
of coronary artery is worse in those

359
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,600
individuals with CHIP.

360
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,440
So yes, we have increased risk for

361
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,120
coronary heart disease, but we also have

362
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,360
increased

363
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
calcification of the coronary artery

364
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
even when it doesn't lead to coronary

365
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,760
heart disease.

366
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,839
So these cells with the chip mutation

367
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,040
are leading to some kind of process

368
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:25,839
that's increasing risk for heart disease

369
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,959
without necessarily causing a cancer.

370
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,959
So we're talking about a blood mutation.

371
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,600
Blood mutation impacting heart function

372
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,000
I guess makes some sense, right? But

373
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,800
could these mutations also have further

374
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
reaching effects? And our lab is very

375
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
interested in the brain as I brought up

376
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,199
before. So we wondered whether chip

377
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,120
mutations might be associated with a

378
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,800
neurological disease associated with

379
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,199
aging Alzheimer's disease.

380
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,279
So if we look in the brain and we

381
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,279
specifically look for chip mutations,

382
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,399
all of these genes here, oop sorry,

383
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,160
all of these mutations are chip genes.

384
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,199
We look at Alzheimer's disease

385
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,199
individuals and aged controls. We see

386
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,440
that they're more prevalent in

387
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,839
Alzheimer's disease.

388
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,399
Each one of these columns is an

389
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,120
individual and all these rows are

390
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,199
different genes with chip mutations. So

391
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,920
we see some Alzheimer's individuals have

392
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,320
multiple chip mutations detected. A lot

393
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,720
of them have at least one. And these

394
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,160
percentages when you compare across the

395
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,320
different rows, we show that there are

396
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,880
more mutations in those with Alzheimer's

397
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,040
disease than the controls. They're not

398
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,720
unique to Alzheimer's, but they're more

399
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,959
common in those who do have Alzheimer's.

400
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,519
So this is something that happens in the

401
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,360
blood associated with a neurological

402
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,120
condition. So how does that make any

403
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,639
sense? Isn't the brain supposed to be a

404
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,160
privileged space where they only have

405
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,880
their own cells and the blood doesn't

406
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,800
necessarily get there? Right? An

407
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,440
important thing to consider here is that

408
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,079
Alzheimer's disease is associated with

409
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,280
some infiltration of blood derived

410
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,600
macrofasages into the brain and also

411
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,600
there is a similar group of cells to

412
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,199
hematopoetic stem cells in terms of

413
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,199
microga in the brain itself. So there's

414
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,600
kind of two hypotheses we have for what

415
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,760
might be going on here.

416
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,520
In the normal brain, we have microg GA

417
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,720
that are the resident immune cells of

418
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,960
the brain. They can randomly mutate. We

419
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,280
don't have a chip mutations. This would

420
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,919
lead to normal aging. But if we do have

421
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,080
chip mutations, maybe as a result of

422
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,000
some inflammatory process, maybe some

423
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,760
towangles accumulating or we might have

424
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,720
infiltration of blood derived

425
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,520
macrofasages with chip mutations. Both

426
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,720
of those events could lead to a

427
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,520
population of cells in the brain with

428
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,080
chip mutations that could lead to

429
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,840
increased inflammation. So there's a

430
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,600
couple different possibilities for how

431
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,640
chip mutations, whether they're in the

432
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,080
blood or whether they're in the

433
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,160
microglea of the brain, could lead to

434
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
increased activity of microglea

435
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
inflammation and potentially

436
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,960
neurodeeneration.

437
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,360
Folks who study Alzheimer's disease know

438
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,120
a lot of those genes associated germline

439
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,280
mutations in terms of Alzheimer's

440
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,640
disease have to do with immune activity.

441
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,559
So this would be consistent with the

442
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,120
idea that Alzheimer's disease has to do

443
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,120
with immune function.

444
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,520
So,

445
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,840
we've talked about a couple of different

446
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,760
ways that sematic mutations can be

447
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,600
important. We've talked about ways that

448
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,760
germline mutations can be important,

449
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,039
too. So, now I'm going to start to

450
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
categorize these, and we're going to

451
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,679
talk about a third type of mutations and

452
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,080
how they can impact human health. So, in

453
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,000
a germline mutation, all of the cells of

454
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,840
the body have it. And for whatever

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,520
reason, it's more impactful on one part

456
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,240
of the body than another. We talked

457
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,200
about TM161B having this very important

458
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,440
impact on brain development. We also

459
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
talked about examples where the mutation

460
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,679
isn't present in every single cell. It

461
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,000
happens at some point during development

462
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,240
or maybe it happens after development.

463
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,919
But in any case, it's just a group of

464
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,080
cells that are related to each other

465
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,160
clonally that harbor the sematic

466
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,400
mutation. In this case, we see neurons

467
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,400
shown with the red sematic mutation and

468
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,559
intestinal cells shown with the green

469
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,679
sematic mutation.

470
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,919
But there's also another possibility.

471
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,679
Cells that are done proliferating,

472
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,000
they're terminally differentiated, such

473
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,520
as neurons in the brain, can still

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,840
accumulate sematic mutations, right?

475
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,160
These we would term private sematic

476
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,760
mutations. They're just in individual

477
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
cells.

478
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,960
But you know, there's like this this

479
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
phrase that people like to say, if a

480
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,280
tree falls in a forest and no one is

481
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,600
around to hear it, does it make a sound?

482
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Right? We could similarly ask if a cell

483
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,120
acquires a mutation that doesn't

484
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,679
increase its proliferation, does anybody

485
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,600
notice? Does anybody care? Right? How do

486
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,360
we detect that? It's an interesting

487
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
question, but how do we ultimately

488
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,440
detect it when all the mutations I've

489
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,440
described to you so far have an effect

490
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,679
on proliferation that allows us to

491
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,039
notice them?

492
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,200
So to address this, Alex Kagan, who now

493
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,039
has his own group, did something very

494
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,679
clever.

495
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:23,520
So these here on the left are H& stains

496
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,280
of the colarctal crypts. So all of these

497
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,280
here are like the villi that stick out

498
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,280
into the middle of the intestine and the

499
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,120
colon in order to pick up nutrients and

500
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,720
water. They're constantly being

501
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,520
regenerated and replaced because they

502
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,159
suffer a lot of damage. But shown here

503
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,039
outlined in these dotted lines are

504
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,240
individual crips. These are just the

505
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:47,280
individual pieces sticking out.

506
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,400
And the reason they're special is that

507
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,200
each of these crypts derives from just

508
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,440
one stem cell.

509
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,320
One stem cell out of many that live in

510
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,679
this pool here in the inner intestine is

511
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,159
going to give rise to one crypt.

512
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,720
So that means that if we sequence just

513
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,600
one crypt, we can get an idea for the

514
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,720
mutations that were in that original one

515
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,280
stem cell.

516
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,480
So this is going to allow Alex Kagan to

517
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,600
ask two important questions. The first

518
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,679
is do individual stem cells in the

519
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,120
intestine accumulate mutations over

520
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,320
time? Do older individuals have more

521
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,960
mutations in their stem cells than young

522
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,159
individuals? And the second which you

523
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,000
might be able to guess from the fact

524
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,280
that we have four different mammals

525
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,840
pictured here in terms of these

526
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,159
intestinal crypt examples is whether

527
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,640
this age related accumulation of sematic

528
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,559
mutations has to do with lifespan.

529
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,400
So in this study we're going to look at

530
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,559
mice which live 2 years and humans which

531
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,120
live 80 years.

532
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,919
If sematic mutations are just a function

533
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,760
of time, then the old humans are going

534
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,520
to have by far the most sematic

535
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,520
mutations in the study because the

536
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,080
humans live the longest, right? But if

537
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,799
instead sematic mutations accumulate as

538
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,559
a function of lifespan, then a 2year-old

539
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,720
mouse is going to have just as many

540
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,880
sematic mutations as an 80year-old

541
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
human, meaning that the yearly sematic

542
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
mutation accumulation rate is going to

543
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,120
be much, much higher.

544
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,440
And it turns out it's the second option.

545
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,120
So here we have on a log scale we have

546
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,760
uh mean mutation rate per year. We have

547
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,400
mouse here up at 800 per year because

548
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,039
they only live 2 years. And then humans

549
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,919
way down here at much less living about

550
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,000
80 years. And all of these different

551
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,440
mammals that were also tested that

552
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,760
follow the same idea. Increased lifespan

553
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,480
means decrease the maniput mutation rate

554
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,159
per year. And that's of course this is

555
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,480
all correlative, but it's awfully

556
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,640
suspicious. Why go to the effort to

557
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,919
increase your DNA repair capacity so

558
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,159
much for no reason? Perhaps it has

559
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,760
something to do with lifespan,

560
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:14,240
maintaining a relatively high integrity

561
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,440
genome in these intestinal stem cells.

562
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,679
So, one of the things that we can do now

563
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,760
when we have the mutational profile of

564
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,360
an individual cell, instead of just

565
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,600
talking about one really impactful

566
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,120
sematic mutation that increases growth,

567
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,960
we're talking about a whole lot of

568
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,039
mutations, hundreds of mutations, maybe

569
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,120
even thousands of mutations, which

570
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,280
allows us to think about where these

571
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,600
mutations are happening to give us a

572
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,360
sense for mutational processes that

573
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,000
might lead to the formation of these

574
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,600
mutations. Now that we have so many, we

575
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,080
can start to categorize them and look

576
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,799
for patterns. And one of the important

577
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,840
ways we look for patterns is we look at

578
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,559
how what how each base changes. So which

579
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,960
base is changing to which base and also

580
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,600
the genomic context

581
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,520
and the way we look at that is a 96

582
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,000
profile.

583
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,760
So what I've got here is the six

584
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,919
different types of mutations that can

585
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,240
happen. We have cytosine to adinine

586
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,880
mutation, cytosine to guanine, and so on

587
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,799
and so forth. You'll notice that I have

588
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,120
cytosine to adinine, but I don't have

589
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,120
guanine to thymine. The reason for that

590
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,200
is, at least for now, we're only

591
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,000
interested in double stranded mutations.

592
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,279
So every C to A mutation is also a GT

593
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
mutation and so on and so forth.

594
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,200
So plotted here is the mutation fraction

595
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
on the x-axis broken down within each of

596
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,279
these six groups is called the tri

597
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,720
nucleotide context. So it turns out that

598
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,880
a lot of the sematic mutational

599
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,000
processes that we know understand have

600
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,720
unique patterns that have to do not just

601
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,520
with the base change but with the

602
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,919
neighboring bases.

603
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,000
So we could see here that in this

604
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,760
mutational process, this was extracted

605
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,240
from the data in that intestinal crypt

606
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,840
study that I showed you earlier. We see

607
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,600
these four towers poking out above all

608
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,120
the rest of the mutations that are

609
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,120
possible.

610
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,440
And in case this is difficult to see,

611
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm going to give it away to you and say

612
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,520
that these are all at CPG sites. So

613
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,919
these aren't just C tot mutations in

614
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,360
general. There's C to C mutations when

615
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,360
that C is right next to a guani.

616
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,000
And folks who study methylation might

617
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,240
already know where I'm going with this.

618
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,840
It turns out that this is SPS1.

619
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,240
This is the result of a sematic

620
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,240
mutational process whereby spontaneous

621
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,480
damination of specifically

622
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,279
fivemethyctosine

623
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,240
leads to a misrecognition

624
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,640
during DNA replication where that

625
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,559
original fivemethyl cytosine looks like

626
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,720
a thymine and we get a mutation.

627
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,480
So a critical thing to note about this

628
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,919
somatic mutational process, this

629
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,880
signature SPS1 is that this accumulates

630
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,799
in fast proliferating cells because I

631
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,279
mentioned the process the spontaneous

632
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,159
damination and the misrecognition that

633
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,080
requires DNA replication. If a

634
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,400
spontaneous damination happens in a

635
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,400
non-replicative cell, this mutation

636
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,919
doesn't occur because you need the DNA

637
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,200
replication machinery to make the

638
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,679
mistake to even see it at all.

639
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,080
By contrast, I'm going to tell you about

640
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,159
just one other SPS signature called

641
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,159
SPS5.

642
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,840
So this signature, we see it's a little

643
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,760
bit more balanced across all the

644
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,600
different groups. This mutational

645
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,520
mechanism is not currently well

646
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,080
understood, but we see that it

647
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,279
accumulates even in cells that are done

648
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,840
dividing. So whatever is happening here,

649
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,760
it probably doesn't require DNA

650
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,039
replication because it accumulates in

651
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,120
cells that are terminally

652
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,320
differentiated.

653
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,520
So I'm just telling you about SPS1 and

654
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,760
SPS5 for now. But in this cosmic

655
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,080
database, this catalog of sematic

656
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,000
mutations and cancer database, there are

657
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,880
many dozens more of these sematic

658
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,440
mutation signatures.

659
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,159
So if we go back to our intestinal

660
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,799
crypts, one thing we can do with this

661
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,279
data now is we could extract signatures

662
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,760
and see which of these mutational

663
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,400
signatures is really driving this age

664
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,480
related accumulation of mutations. And

665
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,159
it turns out it's quite clear which is

666
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,240
doing most of the work. It's SPS1.

667
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,720
These other two signatures did not match

668
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,679
as well to specific SPS signatures and

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,880
were reported as just SPS and SPSC. but

670
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,039
one very clearly matched on to SPS1 and

671
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,440
that's the one doing a whole lot of the

672
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,559
work in terms of accumulating sematic

673
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,559
mutations and this makes sense right

674
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,080
because those intestinal stem cells have

675
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
to keep dividing they have to keep

676
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,039
making more and more of those crypts as

677
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,399
they're destroyed throughout their

678
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:01,960
function so lots of proliferation lots

679
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,960
of SPS1

680
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,399
so

681
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,960
what we can wonder now we've have

682
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,880
improved in technology. We don't need to

683
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,600
be as clever as Alex Kagan do this thing

684
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,480
with the crypts. Now we can study

685
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,960
individual cells and just amplify their

686
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,200
whole genome and do the same question.

687
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,360
Look at individual cells like postmotic

688
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,720
neurons and say are they also

689
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,399
accumulating some mutations with age and

690
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,559
as it turns out they are as well. So

691
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,320
these each one of these dots is a

692
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,120
singular neuron from the prefrontal

693
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,399
cortex of a pervison and we see that

694
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,320
there are more sematic mutations in aged

695
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,679
individuals

696
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,960
and these [clears throat] happen despite

697
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,640
being postic. All of this time here from

698
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,559
0 to 90 I guess is not time that the

699
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,200
neurons spend dividing but just time

700
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,399
they spend existing and nonetheless

701
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,399
accumulating sematic mutations.

702
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,840
We can also look at disease. In this

703
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,919
case, we have human samples. We could

704
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,799
think about what might impact sematic

705
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,960
mutation rates besides age. And here we

706
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,360
have two examples of DNA repair

707
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,840
deficiencies. This is cockine syndrome

708
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,840
and zerodmap pigmentotosum. And if we

709
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,399
normalize for age, even when we

710
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,360
normalize for age, the cockine syndrome

711
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,919
individuals, the XP individuals both

712
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,960
have more sematic mutations than the

713
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:32,000
neurotypical individuals.

714
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,440
So we see that DNA damage repair has

715
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
something to do with accumulation of

716
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,360
semantic mutations. We see that when we

717
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,440
have diseases where it's impacted that

718
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,840
also impacts sematic mutations.

719
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,440
And once again we can do our signature

720
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,159
analysis.

721
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,559
So we extract two signatures. This time

722
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,080
we find one signature A which is a lot

723
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,399
like SPS5 and signature B which is a lot

724
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,799
like SPS1.

725
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,520
And then we could do the same test.

726
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,360
Which of these processes is driving the

727
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
age related accumulation of sematic

728
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,240
mutations? And relative to the

729
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,760
intestinal crypts, we get the opposite

730
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,679
results. So signature A, which is a lot

731
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,960
like SPS5,

732
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,360
this one is doing a lot of the work. So

733
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,600
this is all making sense to us. The

734
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,159
sematic mutational signature associated

735
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,159
with post-motic cells accumulating

736
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,559
mutations is what's driving this age-

737
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,799
related accumulation in neurons. And

738
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,880
this is true in the prefrontal cortex.

739
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,039
It's true in the dentate gyrus. It's

740
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,039
true in our cocaine syndrome and zero

741
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,640
pigmentotosive individuals. We see this

742
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:44,640
across groups. This linear accumulation

743
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,919
by contrast SPS1 we don't see so much of

744
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,559
an accumulation over time.

745
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,320
There is evidence for SPS1 here because

746
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,880
while those neurons aren't dividing

747
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,039
during our lives, they do have a history

748
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,279
of cell division. So there is the

749
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,279
capacity for neurons to have SPS1

750
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,960
related sematic mutations, they're just

751
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,320
associated with developments and

752
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,080
presumably don't change over our lives.

753
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,320
It only goes up during our brains

754
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,799
development.

755
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,480
But you know, when we're looking at

756
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,240
disease, right, we kind of picked some

757
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,720
lowhanging fruit here, right? Right? We

758
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,840
looked at a DNA damage associated

759
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,480
disease, a mutation in the DNA damage

760
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,320
repair system. We saw more mutations.

761
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,799
That kind of makes sense, right? That's

762
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,799
not that surprising. So, we wanted to go

763
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:36,080
back again to Alzheimer's disease. And

764
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,840
here we saw a similar phenomenon. So,

765
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,320
here we have neurons from the prefrontal

766
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,200
cortex and the hippocampus in both

767
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,000
control and Alzheimer's disease. And we

768
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,000
see age related accumulation in both.

769
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,480
But in this red line, you can see that

770
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,480
the Alzheimer's diseases individuals

771
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,200
have more mutations than their

772
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,279
neurotypical counterparts. On the right

773
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,960
side, we can see that if you normalize

774
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,960
for age and just do a head-to-head

775
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,640
comparison, we see on average

776
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,159
Alzheimer's disease neurons have more

777
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,760
mutations.

778
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,320
And for those of you wondering what the

779
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,240
reduction in lifespan is in Alzheimer's

780
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,640
disease, typically it's there's a lot of

781
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,720
variability to this, but Alzheimer's

782
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,640
disease can be diagnosed an individual

783
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,159
lives somewhere between 3 and 12 years.

784
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,159
There's a reduction in lifespan of

785
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,320
somewhere in that range. And that's

786
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,799
roughly consistent with the increase in

787
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,039
sematic mutations that we see here in

788
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,000
Alzheimer's disease versus age matched

789
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,080
control. Once again giving us the idea

790
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,559
that the sematic mutation rate in

791
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,200
individual cells might have something to

792
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,279
do with our lifespan.

793
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,679
So we've done a couple of different

794
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,360
things now. We've looked at DNA damage

795
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,120
deficiency. We've looked at a

796
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,480
neurodeenerative disease in terms of

797
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,399
Alzheimer's. But Alzheimer's disease,

798
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,519
we're still not quite sure for a lot of

799
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,960
the cases what the cause is. What if we

800
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,360
could look at something where we know

801
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,840
the cause? a neurodeenerative disease

802
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,840
where we understand the cause underlying

803
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,080
the neurodeeneration.

804
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,240
So we looked at chronic traumatic

805
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,600
encphylopathy.

806
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,279
Some of you may have heard of this. It

807
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,960
gets some attention in the media. This

808
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,720
is often diagnosed in individuals who

809
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,600
participate in the military, individuals

810
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,559
who play contact sports such as American

811
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,080
football and boxing. Right? Chronic

812
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,679
traumatic encphylopathy is neuro

813
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,559
degeneration that happens after

814
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,720
repetitive head injury.

815
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,960
So this allows us to do a very

816
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,120
interesting experiment. We can look at

817
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,279
control individuals shown in the dark

818
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,679
blue and see a nice accumulation over

819
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,320
time of sematic mutations. We could look

820
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,559
at those individuals with CTE shown in

821
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,720
the red and see once again more sematic

822
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,320
mutations. But we can additionally look

823
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,399
at an RHI group. So this is those

824
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,799
individuals who have repetitive head

825
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:55,120
injury but were not diagnosed with CTE.

826
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,360
So it's not

827
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,640
just repetitive head injury that causes

828
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,720
sematic mutations. It have to have both.

829
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,679
You have to have the neurodeeneration

830
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,600
and the repetitive head injury to be at

831
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,240
a greater risk of accumulating sematic

832
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,000
mutations. Those RHI individuals have a

833
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,359
relatively normal amount of sematic

834
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,240
mutations. It's only those with CTE that

835
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,240
have more sematic mutations.

836
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,520
So now we're really getting through a

837
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,480
whole lot of different brain conditions

838
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,280
that have to do with neurodeeneration,

839
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,520
aging, DNA repair, right? And seeing

840
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,399
that private sematic mutations can be

841
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,040
important too.

842
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,760
So I've told you about a few different

843
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,520
sematic mutational processes now, right?

844
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,599
We started talking about germline

845
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,720
mutations when I told you about TMM

846
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,560
161B. I told you about how we discovered

847
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,560
this mutation by looking in the blood of

848
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,800
the individuals. Presumably all the

849
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,599
cells in the body have this mutation and

850
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,280
then for whatever reason this mutation

851
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,240
specifically impacts the brain. But we

852
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,640
can also have more targeted effects. We

853
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,680
talked about how in hemgalencily

854
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,839
it's a developmental sematic mutation

855
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,119
something that impacts only part of the

856
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,960
brain that leads to this disease. We

857
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,040
know that because the mutation is only

858
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,359
present in some parts of the brain. It's

859
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,680
not in the blood and the brain is what's

860
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,960
affected.

861
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,800
And finally, we talked about

862
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,280
accumulation of private sematic

863
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,280
mutations. So, we talked about how that

864
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,040
has to do with lifespan across lots of

865
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,119
different mammals. We talked about how

866
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,240
it has to do with disease as well as

867
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,920
aging in humans. And it's not just DNA

868
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,200
damage repair machinery that's

869
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,440
different. It's also other neurological

870
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,599
diseases that aren't directly associated

871
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,240
with DNA damage repair or sematic

872
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,560
mutational processes.

873
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,720
So, I've hope I've convinced you that

874
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,920
sematic mutations can have a big impact

875
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,240
on our health even if it's not cancer.

876
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,920
And I'm going to thank like my lab. This

877
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,599
is where I learned all of my the

878
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,119
semantic mutational stuff. This is all

879
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,400
of us celebrating all the postocs who

880
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,320
are moving on to bigger and better

881
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,200
things. Right? These are my funding

882
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,040
sources up here. And I got the I had the

883
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,720
pleasure of working with a lot of these

884
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,320
individuals. I haven't worked with all

885
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,480
of them, but they're all first authors

886
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,480
on the papers that I talked about today.

887
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,119
And I'd be really excited to answer any

888
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,119
questions that you have.

889
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,839
That was fantastic. Um, if you have a

890
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
question, please come up to the

891
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:38,800
microphones in the middle of the room.

892
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,839
Um okay I will start. Um I'm wondering

893
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,280
how much this impacts uh organs or

894
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,119
diseases that you didn't mention. For

895
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,640
example, I study kidneys.

896
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
>> Should I be interested in somatic

897
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,640
mutations or is it like does someone

898
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,680
look into this and there was nothing

899
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,720
there or is it unexplored space for

900
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,560
other organs?

901
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,079
>> That's a great question. So it kind of

902
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,440
feels like sometimes in the Walsh side

903
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,800
we just pick a random disease and

904
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,200
there's going to be sematic mutations

905
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,640
there, right? But there is a process we

906
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,640
have for thinking about what's more

907
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,560
likely to have a sematic mutational

908
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,640
process as the root. The brain is an

909
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,920
especially good candidate because all

910
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,359
those neurons are postmotic. So when we

911
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,119
have the development of the brain, if

912
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,480
there are sematic mutations that occur,

913
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,400
those sematic mutations persist forever

914
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,640
even if they don't cause a proliferative

915
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,000
advantage. Presumably in another system

916
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,400
where there's more turnover of the

917
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,079
cells, if there's a damaging sematic

918
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,800
mutation, that cell might just be

919
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,720
replaced by something else. So in

920
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,720
general, if we have some kind of, you

921
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,760
know, if we go back to like some of

922
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,240
these examples, hemaggalinsphily is in

923
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,440
hindsight a very good example of

924
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,119
something that might have a sematic

925
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,280
mutational process associated with it

926
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,000
because it has a defined region of the

927
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,880
organ that's affected and it's has it's

928
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,320
full of postmotic cells. So thinking

929
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,000
about other organ systems, there are

930
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,280
definitely other examples that exist. We

931
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,680
talked about proteus syndrome which is

932
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,440
theoretically happen anywhere, right?

933
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,440
But one of the things we look for to be

934
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,359
suspicious about sematic mutations is if

935
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,200
a defined region of the organ is more

936
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:12,000
affected than other parts of the organ.

937
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,040
Awesome.

938
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,200
>> This is Pam. Um I have a question. Well,

939
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,119
I have two questions. Um the first is

940
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,040
for people with like CTE for example or

941
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,359
some one of these other brain conditions

942
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,520
with more sematic varants. Um do you see

943
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:36,000
can you see a signature of that in the

944
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:40,400
blood at all or is it really specific

945
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,760
only to just wondering if if like um

946
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,920
yeah you probably wouldn't see in the

947
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,160
blood but I'm just asking. And then

948
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,480
another question is do you have an

949
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,119
understanding of what the mechanism is

950
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,480
of how like increased trauma would lead

951
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,400
to more sematic varants?

952
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,480
>> Yeah. Okay. That's these are fantastic

953
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,160
questions. The first question is about

954
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,599
whether there are also more sematic

955
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,760
mutations in the blood of individuals

956
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,520
with CTE. So the first thing I'm going

957
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,280
to say is no. We didn't check. So we

958
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,520
don't know. But we would hypothesize

959
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,680
that there wouldn't be because we're not

960
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,200
just looking generally at the brain when

961
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,200
we're looking at that sematic mutation

962
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,680
accumulation. We're looking specifically

963
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,119
at the neurons. So those neurons are

964
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,720
going to be somewhat special. They're

965
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,440
all postmotic. They live in the brain

966
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,040
forever. If we by contrast saw mutations

967
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,359
that we thought were happening in the ga

968
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,040
of the brain, that might be something

969
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,200
that we thought would also apply to

970
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,960
other parts of the body. But in this

971
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,480
case, we have an event that's specific

972
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
to the head terms of repetitive head

973
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,079
injury. we're specifically seeing this

974
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,640
mutational process in the neurons. So I

975
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,560
would guess there probably isn't a

976
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,480
increase in mutations in the blood but

977
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,160
we didn't check. The other thing is like

978
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,160
how do we think these mutations might be

979
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,960
happening. So there's various um

980
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,240
symptoms associated with CTE right you

981
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,079
look at the brains of the individuals

982
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,680
you look at the pathology we can see

983
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,240
that there are areas of the brain that

984
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,000
degenerate faster than others there's a

985
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,520
lot of impact that happens that could

986
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,040
affect the folds of the brain

987
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,880
specifically there some pathology that

988
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,280
suggests souls might be especially

989
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,000
affected for example ultimately it's

990
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,000
very difficult to tell um model organism

991
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,079
research on CTE is still just kind of

992
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,640
getting rolling it's very difficult to

993
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,119
do a lot this work because CTE can also

994
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,720
only be diagnosed at death. So unlike

995
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,320
Alzheimer's disease, we can't deal with

996
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,040
living individuals that have the

997
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,119
condition.

998
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,960
>> Thanks for the great talk. Um my

999
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,280
question was a little bit kind of the

1000
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,119
same as the last question there. Um uh

1001
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,079
asking about the mechanism that you

1002
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,720
suspect in CTE uh related to I guess

1003
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,320
some repair processes after injury. Um

1004
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,920
but I guess I could continue that and

1005
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,680
say does that uh sort of uh questions

1006
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,400
about the mechanism say something then

1007
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,920
about the mechanism of uh Alzheimer's

1008
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,359
disease of how you get these sematic

1009
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,640
mutations.

1010
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,880
>> Yeah. Yeah. So these are both

1011
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,720
neurodeenerative diseases, right? They

1012
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,040
both have increased sematic mutations in

1013
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,319
the neurons, right? I think that one of

1014
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,440
the things that we could say sort of

1015
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,920
putting both studies together is that we

1016
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,599
may have a commonality between them that

1017
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,480
neurodeenerative diseases may have

1018
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,839
something in common. We see some um

1019
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,599
sematic mutation signatures that are

1020
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,920
similar between the two. A lot of the

1021
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,280
baseline SPS5 SPS1 signatures are

1022
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,440
similar but there are other mutational

1023
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,119
signatures that are different. So I

1024
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,800
think putting them together I think

1025
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,160
there's still a lot more work that has

1026
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,240
to be done to get increasingly

1027
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,240
mechanistic. But I think that what I

1028
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,800
would surmise is that something that

1029
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,720
damages the DNA or the ability of a cell

1030
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,640
to repair its DNA more accurately is

1031
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,720
going to have long lasting consequences

1032
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,119
and potentially lead to some increased

1033
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,640
death of neurons that can't be replaced

1034
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,640
because those are the cells post my

1035
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,640
talk.

1036
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm wondering if you could briefly touch

1037
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,880
on the um like the computational

1038
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,000
challenges in studying somatic mutations

1039
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,160
especially when you're talking about the

1040
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,560
cells that aren't proliferating and they

1041
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,440
have like how many reads like how do you

1042
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,359
measure that?

1043
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,319
>> Yeah. No, that's I I decided not to

1044
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,440
touch on that at all in this

1045
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,480
presentation because that could be like

1046
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,000
a whole four-hour long talk. Um just

1047
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,920
touching on some of the challenges you

1048
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,839
have to deal with. I mentioned that, you

1049
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,920
know, Alex Kagan had the privilege of

1050
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,240
looking at a whole group of cells that

1051
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,079
presumably all harbor a mutation. That

1052
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,000
makes your life much easier. You have

1053
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,160
many, many copies presumably of the

1054
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,240
mutation that exist in that sample. So,

1055
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,160
you get a lot of cracks at it. By

1056
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,960
contrast, if you have to amplify the

1057
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,319
genome of just one cell, you have to be

1058
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,640
really, really confident that you're

1059
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,240
doing it right. So, there's two kind of

1060
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,079
broad strategies I can tell you about

1061
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,640
for how to do a single cell whole genome

1062
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,800
sequencing experiment. One of them

1063
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,960
involves getting the amplification to be

1064
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,560
very reliable. The other one involves

1065
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,240
tagging the two different strands

1066
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,760
separately. So you could check your

1067
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,280
work. If you find a mutation on one

1068
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,000
strand, you check the complimentary

1069
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,160
strand and see if you agree. So in the

1070
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
first strategy, you try to amplify the

1071
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,520
DNA in such a way that you're not

1072
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,680
propagating error. So you look at your

1073
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,599
template DNA, your original genomic DNA,

1074
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,480
and you set up your chemistry so that

1075
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,240
you only amplify off of that template

1076
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,000
rather than amplifying off of the

1077
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,200
amplification of the previous round of

1078
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,920
PCR. That helps a whole lot. And you can

1079
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,640
check your work by looking at known

1080
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,480
germline mutations. So you could see, am

1081
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,200
I detecting all the germline mutations I

1082
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,280
expect to detect? do the mutations I see

1083
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,119
next to the germline mutations match up

1084
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,640
in terms of what I expect in terms of

1085
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,720
hetererozygous snips and stuff like

1086
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,119
that. The other way you think about it

1087
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,119
is strand tagging. So strand tagging

1088
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,200
means that at that first step when you

1089
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,359
separate the strands of DNA you tag them

1090
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,359
with a primer so that when you call

1091
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,599
every single mutation you can then

1092
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,720
computationally check to see if on the

1093
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,960
opposite strand of DNA you agree. A lots

1094
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,640
of the mutations associated with library

1095
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,480
prep are going to be on single strands

1096
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,720
rather than both strands, especially if

1097
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,359
they're processed separately. So tagging

1098
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,359
the two different strands called duplex

1099
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,280
sequencing is going to give you a really

1100
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,920
big boost in your sensitivity and

1101
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:11,520
accuracy.

1102
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:14,160
>> Great. And then um we have one more. Um,

1103
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,680
I was uh we're wondering if the

1104
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,359
proliferation or turnover of the cells

1105
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,720
is going to impact how many summatic

1106
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,160
mutations it gets. I'm wondering if

1107
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,319
there's other characteristics of cells

1108
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,079
that make them more or less susceptible.

1109
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,640
Maybe variation in the DNA repair

1110
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,319
mechanisms and certain cell types.

1111
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,319
>> Yeah. Yeah, that's a fantastic question.

1112
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,680
So, it's definitely true that cells that

1113
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,359
proliferate faster are going to be more

1114
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,319
prone to accumulating sematic mutations.

1115
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,000
We see that across systems. We also see

1116
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,079
that different cell types accumulate

1117
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,040
sematic mutations at different rates. So

1118
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,960
the lowest rate of accumulation of

1119
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,040
sematic mutations in any human cell

1120
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,640
types have been tested so far is

1121
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,680
something you might expect. It's the

1122
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,520
germ cells. Sperm is the gold standard

1123
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,359
for the lowest accumulation of sematic

1124
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,560
mutations because those mutations are

1125
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,160
going to be passed on to the next

1126
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,480
generation. Right? We need to keep that

1127
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,400
DNA very very perfect if we can. Neurons

1128
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,880
have about half of the accumulation of

1129
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,599
sematic mutations over time as do

1130
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,280
intestinal crypt cells. So different

1131
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,839
cell types definitely have a different

1132
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,400
amount of prioritization in terms of DNA

1133
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,839
repair and keeping the DNA integrity

1134
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,440
high. And that's going to depend on

1135
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,200
their function, how long lived they are,

1136
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,800
and lots of other factors. And I think

1137
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,960
we're just getting started about like

1138
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,880
really rigorously profiling exactly

1139
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,440
which cells have what kind of capacity

1140
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,440
for DNA repair.

1141
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,040
questions in the room.

1142
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,839
All right, great. We'll thank our

1143
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,839
speaker one more time.
