1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,680
good afternoon and thanks uh for having

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,319
triangulate Labs here uh yeah as you

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,840
said I'm Bill Hall co-founder and CEO of

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,960
triangulate labs um I have three degrees

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,080
from MIT and served as a lecturer for a

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,719
few years so I'm excited to tell you

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,920
about our product Skin Map and to

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,199
explore how it might be useful um the

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,119
backstory of this I founded triangulate

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,640
Labs after I lost my little sister to a

11
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,760
rare cancer um that was not on the skin

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,640
um but that made me focus on cancer and

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
I realized there was a need to document

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,079
the skin in accurately for skin cancer

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,280
and it turns out for many other things

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,960
um so first I'll just say a quick bit

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,399
about skin cancer and then go on to some

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,760
of the other follow on someone dies from

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,399
skin cancer every four and a half

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,680
minutes and they don't really have to um

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,320
it's easy to cure when it's found early

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,559
and it's right here on our skin where we

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,480
should be able to find it early but we

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,480
don't um because to catch skin cancer in

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,600
110 million Americans at high risk and

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,920
many more around the world we need an

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,200
accurate test and people need to take

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,119
that test our best test is a total body

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,880
skin exam by a dermatologist which

30
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,600
hasn't been found sufficiently accurate

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,600
for screening by the US preventive

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,320
Services Task Force or many other bodies

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,880
around the world um but it has been

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,439
shown that if a dermatologist can see

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,560
how the skin is changing that they're

36
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,040
more accurate um there are some

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,479
approaches to doing this called total

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
body photography but the existing

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,079
systems uh for total body photography if

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,520
you're too cost prohibitive or slow for

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,000
the clinic so we built Skin Map which is

42
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,600
being used by dermatologists now they're

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,200
10 million dermatologists in the US uh

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,799
or 10 million patients who see

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,200
dermatologists uh in the US every year

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,000
but that's only about 10% of the at risk

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,240
population so for them we're developing

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,719
AI but let me just show you how the

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,280
basic skin documentation piece works

50
00:01:53,719 --> 00:02:00,039
this is what's in the clinics now you

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,680
use um currently it's an iOS device on

52
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,520
and it's an app that runs on an iOS

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,360
device with an AWS back end so you

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,879
capture images by just passing the

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,920
smartphone over the skin our patented

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,040
software then recognizes where each

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,519
pixel belongs in the body so that then

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,280
you can compare and look at how it how

59
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,000
uh the skin looks now compared to how it

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,599
was before the software can

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,239
automatically reproject the 3D

62
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,360
information it's capturing into the same

63
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,360
perspective that you're looking at so

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,239
for instance if if something's changed

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,720
it seems to Blink at you which is why we

66
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:40,599
call this a blink detector um so the

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,959
dermatologists who like this uh the the

68
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,800
thing that really makes it work for them

69
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,480
is that it's fast it takes us 60 seconds

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,159
to capture about 500 images in a scan um

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,280
and that works in the clinic they can

72
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,200
fit it in a typical dermatologist sees

73
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,840
seven or eight patients per hour um the

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,800
competition is usually a 10 or 15 minute

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,560
process and to take take that long they

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,599
would need three times as many exam

77
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,000
rooms and space in their in their

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,239
clinics um a second direction we're

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,720
looking is remote clinical studies and

80
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,000
General Skin

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,400
documentation uh you probably all

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,560
understand in-person studies are

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,159
expensive you it limits the enrollment

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,120
to the catchment area of the Imaging

85
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,840
Center and uh so we're beginning with

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,560
one consumer goods company to look at

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,360
product testing and enabling uh going

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,920
out to remote studies uh and and

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,000
allowing the the participants to capture

90
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,319
the information better uh it also

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,920
because we're capturing 3D we can

92
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,120
measure without the 2D effects of

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,640
traditional

94
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,640
photography um more broadly we see the

95
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,079
potential to extend this to other areas

96
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,200
uh such as diagnosing rare diseases with

97
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,079
cutaneous

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
presentation um so uh we're interested

99
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,560
in collaboration of pilots and any those

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,640
areas I've discussed so related to

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,799
catching skin cancer deployment to

102
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,760
dermatologists and other uh providers um

103
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,959
helping with research that would benefit

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,760
from the ability to build large skin

105
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,079
data sets uh for use in accurately

106
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,440
measuring skin Evolution uh such as

107
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,120
decentralized studies and um expanding

108
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,800
internationally we're currently in the

109
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,639
us and we're very interested in going

110
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,560
internationally where we see the bigger

111
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,520
market for us so thank you my contact

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,520
info is there and uh look forward to

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:39,199
talking to you Bill thank you so much um

114
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,600
talking about um that geographies um and

115
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,320
all that how um what's the timeline that

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,039
you could share and also what costs

117
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,400
could be associated with this for

118
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,680
companies to work with

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,960
you um so for geographies

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,560
going some of the we're we're we're

121
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,720
early in the stage and so understanding

122
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,800
the regulatory uh effects if it's being

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,560
deployed in healthcare um and uh so

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
looking for partners who who've gone

125
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,320
there um the costs to use our system are

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,600
really pretty minimal it's it's an app

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:22,840
it's a scalable the main costs are Cloud

128
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,080
type costs um so it's uh it's it's

129
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,319
pretty

130
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,520
reasonable and um I guess it is fit for

131
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,960
tele medicine but could you expand a

132
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,000
little more on that sure yeah that's

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,960
that's a great observation um tele

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,120
medicine in fact we've got a study

135
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,240
kicking off uh with a collaborating

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,720
group in in mayo uh In

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,440
Minnesota where we're evaluating the

138
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:56,319
ability of dermatologists to recognize

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:00,600
skin cancers uh from Skin Map scans so

140
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:03,520
you could technically um reach in the US

141
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,680
there are 50 million Americans that uh

142
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,800
who don't have a dermatologist in the

143
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,880
area and they're at Double a risk of

144
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,919
death from melanoma so we want to we

145
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,759
want to reach out to them and right now

146
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,800
there's no good way to do that uh we

147
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,800
think Skin Map is going to work for that
