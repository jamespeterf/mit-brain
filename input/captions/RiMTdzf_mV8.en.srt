1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,820
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,090
Thank you for joining
us today from all

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,970
around the world for what will
be a terrific conversation

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,670
with our special
guest, June Odongo,

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,750
on how opening up learning
can close knowledge gaps.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,220
My name is Chris Capozzola.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,630
And here at MIT, I'm our Senior
Associate Dean at Open Learning.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,840
And this is the first in
a new open conversation

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,470
series that focuses on the
experiences and impact of Open

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,990
Learning for empowering
people to improve

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,170
their lives, communities,
and the world.

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,050
And as we set out to craft this
new open conversation series,

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,940
one person we really wanted
to talk to is June Odongo.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,600
June is an innovative
entrepreneur, a founder, and now

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,010
the CEO of Senga Technologies, a
logistics software and services

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,600
company in Kenya, catering to
businesses that ship in Africa.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,170
Today, she'll share her insights
on learning, entrepreneurship,

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,440
and the role of open education
in upskilling and changing

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,590
our world.

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,600
So, June, thank you
so much for speaking

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,550
with me and our audience today.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,130
Your experience is
truly inspiring.

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,618
Thank you so much.

25
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:18,910
I didn't know I was your first.

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,410
Thank you.

27
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,860
It's an honor.

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,180
Yeah.

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,820
Yeah.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,710
No, it's been great to hear
and learn about the work

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,030
that you've been doing
over the last few years.

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,910
And I wanted to just
kick it off by asking

33
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,951
you to tell us about your
personal learning journey.

34
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,390
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,810
Well, let me tell a little
bit about my background, which

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,720
actually connects somehow with
OCW So in terms of my education,

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,710
I have a computer science
degree from UMass Lowell, which

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,010
is about 40 minutes
or so from MIT.

39
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,160
Many of my university
professors were actually

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,950
MIT Computer Science graduates.

41
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,140
And I also have an MBA from
the Harvard Business School.

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,970
In terms of how I'd summarize
my learning journey,

43
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,170
I mean, a combination of
formal education, as I've just

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,780
described, and then just
complementing my education

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,100
here and there.

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,950
I think because of
these lecturers that I

47
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,970
who had been at MIT and--

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,262
a lot of our coursework was
actually mimicking MIT classes.

49
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:33,470
So when it came to studying--

50
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,420
And, by the way, I went
to-- if I can date myself,

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,630
I was in undergrad--

52
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,070
I graduated in 2005, so a long
time-- quite a long time ago.

53
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,770
And that's actually how I came
upon Open Learning, effectively

54
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,120
to complement what I knew the
MIT students were studying

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,070
to help me perform better.

56
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,580
You started by taking some
courses on MIT OpenCourseWare,

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,100
but you certainly
didn't stop, right?

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,390
And so you've
definitely been engaged

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,550
in online learning,
continuous learning,

60
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,170
upskilling throughout
your career,

61
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,630
even after sort of two
really significant degrees.

62
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,770
So what motivates
you to keep learning?

63
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,570
You're a busy professional.

64
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,370
How do you make the time?

65
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,370
Why is it important to you?

66
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,490
I almost feel like
there's no choice.

67
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,723
I mean, like in our
company, for example,

68
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,390
I mean, we're trying
to apply technology

69
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,820
to some very complex computing
problems, I would say,

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,690
or mathematics
problems in logistics.

71
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,200
Also, by the way,
I should say this,

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,520
I happen to be one
of those people who

73
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,550
I apply so much
of what I learned

74
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,050
in uni, both in undergrad
and graduate school.

75
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,570
Oftentimes, people
say, oh, whatever

76
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,670
I learned I'm not using.

77
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,160
I am the exact opposite of that.

78
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,460
So building on that is context.

79
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,960
The way we think about--

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,150
I think the way I mentally
think about problem-solving is

81
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,110
the same, but the context
is constantly changing.

82
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,320
There's new ways of solving
some of the same problems.

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,649
Or if you're getting
to-- if you're

84
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,780
encountering a new
problem, you need a new way

85
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,730
to think about it.

86
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,330
And the solution can
either come from you,

87
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,340
or you can borrow
from other people.

88
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,410
And if you're borrowing
from other people,

89
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,430
it could be traditional.

90
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,360
It could be new.

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,230
And the way to get
that information

92
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,065
is to insert yourself into
materials, talking about how

93
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,940
other people are thinking
about these things,

94
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,230
or even enhancing
your own knowledge

95
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,355
if you're trying to come
up with your own solution.

96
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:51,410
So for me, I just think I
have absolutely no choice

97
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,950
but to continue learning.

98
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,160
And in our company, we have--

99
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,980
our team members
are quite young.

100
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,766
Oftentimes, they're recent
university graduates.

101
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:03,460

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,970
I do not write software anymore.

103
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,580
I used to.

104
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,117
[LAUGHS] I just don't.

105
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,700
It was one of the
things, for example,

106
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,930
I'm trying to do is we're
using languages that I didn't

107
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,920
use when I was a student.

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,400
I think we used C or
something in computer science.

109
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,640
They're using Ruby.

110
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,920
I need to learn how
to use Ruby on Rails.

111
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,680
But more importantly,
we're also trying

112
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,450
to apply technologies that
have advanced significantly

113
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,370
in the two decades since
I've been outside of school,

114
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,740
whether it's things
around machine learning,

115
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,100
artificial
intelligence, and so on.

116
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,650
So some of the work I have
to do in terms of learning

117
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,180
is relearning what
I learned in school.

118
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,310
So I actually go through
some of my old curricula,

119
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,970
and then introducing new
concepts on top of that.

120
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,560
So it's just embedded in--

121
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,570
I think learning
has to be embedded

122
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,910
in what we're trying to do and
what I'm trying to accomplish.

123
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,170
Yeah, that's a fantastic story.

124
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,050
I think it reminds us
that the education that we

125
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,570
get with our degrees,
for those of us who

126
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,430
have had the
opportunity to study,

127
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,210
is sometimes a set
of concrete skills,

128
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,500
but it's really just an
investment in our future.

129
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,360
If you don't keep
investing, right,

130
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,610
if you don't keep
watering the plant,

131
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,200
it won't continue to grow.

132
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,430
That's really neat.

133
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,580
So you've talked a
little bit about some

134
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,300
of the work that
your company does,

135
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:45,380
Senga Technologies, and the ways
that technology and software

136
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,710
and software solutions
to logistics problems

137
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,250
are part of the work that
everyone in your company does.

138
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,320
But you've also, in other
discussions that we've had,

139
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,930
sort of reflected that
it's been difficult to come

140
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,820
by software developers--

141
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,210
to hire, recruit,
train, retain them.

142
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,900
And so tell us a little
bit more about how

143
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,490
you've managed not only to
continue your own education,

144
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,300
but to build this up
for all the people

145
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,550
who are part of your team.

146
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,370
So it's less an issue of
finding software developers

147
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,280
because there are actually
plenty of them here, but more

148
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,370
about finding software
developers we can afford

149
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,090
in an era where
software engineers are

150
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,390
such a hot commodity.

151
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,310
And you bring them up, and
Google or Microsoft or whatever

152
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,170
comes and snaps them.

153
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,820
So for us, it was
actually more--

154
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,517
the issue was more a
resource constraint.

155
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:47,100
When I started this
company initially,

156
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,770
I was bootstrapping
it using my savings.

157
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,970
And then when we
got initial funding,

158
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,140
it wasn't a super
substantial amount.

159
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,770
So we've had to run a
really, really lean company.

160
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,560
And that meant we couldn't
afford senior developers and so

161
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,110
on.

162
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,950
And then even if we
could, there's a--

163
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,330
because of how hot the
market was for engineers,

164
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,880
they likely wouldn't have
lasted because there's always

165
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,590
somebody who can pay them more.

166
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,740
So the approach I took was to
hire very high-potential younger

167
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,730
people--

168
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,370
so fresh computer
science graduates,

169
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,130
folks who've been-- who
are just graduating or have

170
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,390
been out of school for
no more than three years.

171
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,090
Yeah.

172
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,730
So that was the
fundamental problem.

173
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:44,540
And then the way OCW actually
came into the Senga story--

174
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,060
it was not intentional at all.

175
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,480
So what happened was
there was a candidate

176
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,560
who had been recommended
by one of our engineers.

177
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,910
She was an electrical engineer,
and she was very, very green.

178
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,610
And we initially
rejected her application.

179
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,220
So her name is Cynthia.

180
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,000
And the person who had
recommended Cynthia

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
is called Warren.

182
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,880
So I go back to--

183
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,210
so I reject her, and she
doesn't say anything,

184
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,830
much like how I used to
be when I was a candidate.

185
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,720
I don't take
rejection very well.

186
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,450
[LAUGHS] Maybe--

187
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,080
I don't-- maybe
she was nonchalant.

188
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Who knows?

189
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,853
But, in any case, I
get back to Warren,

190
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,270
and I'm like, hey, so this is
the feedback on your friend.

191
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,460
She's just too green.

192
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,960
And he says, she's
really high potential.

193
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,680
You need to just think
about that again.

194
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,060
So we go back, and
I talk to Cynthia.

195
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,310
And she was working--

196
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,100
she was designing some kind
of hardware board somewhere.

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,280
And I was like, OK, that's
pretty cool for someone

198
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,500
who's barely out of school.

199
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,720
And I just-- and I thought,
OK, she was very, very bright.

200
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,480
What she didn't have was
a computer science degree,

201
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,350
which for us is very, very
critical in our company

202
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,610
because we are
applying algorithms--

203
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,140
complicated algorithms
and complicated math.

204
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,660
And I just thought, well,
when I was a student,

205
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,750
there was this
resource called OCW

206
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,667
that I used where
you could learn

207
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,500
some of these things
that were complementary

208
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,510
to these textbooks.

209
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,430
So I just suggested
to her, hey, you

210
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,070
could join Senga if you're
willing to quit your job

211
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,210
and do this for six months.

212
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,920
And I created a
curriculum for her

213
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,090
which actually mimicked the
last two years of the computer

214
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,290
science program.

215
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,340
And she said, yes.

216
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,870
And then we ended
up finding this path

217
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:41,870
of bringing on board otherwise
talented individuals who,

218
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,770
for one reason or another, do
not have the education we need.

219
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,920
So as of today, we've
got-- so Cynthia,

220
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,910
she did that program in 2020--

221
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,770
was it last year?

222
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,150
Maybe a little bit--

223
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,290
I think she started end of 2022.

224
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,870
No, no- end of 2023 because
this is her first full year,

225
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,630
actually, as an
engineer at Senga.

226
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,820
And then we've since put
two other individuals

227
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,590
through that program.

228
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,190
The second person we
put through is actually

229
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,720
not a full university graduate.

230
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,300
He's someone who comes from
an under-resourced background

231
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,040
but had the desire
to be an engineer,

232
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,780
had gone to a coding boot camp.

233
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,250
Coding bootcamps, for
us, do not give our folks

234
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,910
what they need, at least for
what works in our company.

235
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,910
We put him through that.

236
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,368
And then we've
since put in someone

237
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:38,610
else who has sort of
like a similar skill set.

238
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,730
So we've been able to
complement our team.

239
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,790
So half our team is
from this program.

240
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,300
Wow.

241
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,500
Yeah.

243
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,740
So that's really interesting.

244
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,710
And that's exactly
the kind of story

245
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,410
that makes us excited
at Open Learning.

246
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,690
It's the kind of thing that
motivates the staff who

247
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,970
work here, and certainly,
the faculty at MIT who

248
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,600
share these materials.

249
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,460
They don't have to do that.

250
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,980
They don't get paid to do that.

251
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,430
They sort of sharing
these materials in order

252
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,440
for other people to use them.

253
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,290
Now, it sounds like
the special sauce

254
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,010
that comes from Senga
Technologies from June Odongo,

255
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,300
is that--

256
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,560
is your work in identifying from
this big curriculum of materials

257
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,450
exactly what's valuable for you
and your firm and your team.

258
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,690
So that's some
really amazing work.

259
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,000
It does raise for
me another question.

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,210
I've taken courses,
watched videos

261
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,330
and lectures from
OpenCourseWare, and some of them

262
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,490
are really hard.

263
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,890
And some of those
problem sets that we

264
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,650
share with the world
are really difficult.

265
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,610
So I'm curious, the
staff who you've

266
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,210
kind of shared this
curriculum with,

267
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,310
do they think it's too hard?

268
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,000
Do they think it's hard and fun?

269
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,125
What's been their reaction.

270
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,170

271
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,670
It's hard.

272
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,490
[LAUGHS] I mean, they're
very complex courses.

273
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,490
I mean, you know, networking
theory, algorithms.

274
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,370
I don't know if they
consider it fun.

275
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,860
No one's told me
they find it fun.

276
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,650
But one thing that's
universal amongst

277
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:26,270
them is that the amount
of learning they get

278
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:33,356
is so, so, so significant
just in a span of six months.

279
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:36,410
So I think they feel
better about themselves,

280
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,900
in terms of what they're
capable, even from a learning

281
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,150
perspective, [INAUDIBLE].

282
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,920
There must be a moment in their
work, or even in your own,

283
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,300
where that light
bulb goes off, where

284
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,790
you're just dealing with some
really tricky work problem.

285
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,570
And then suddenly, you realize
that you have the tools because

286
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,000
of a course that you took
through OpenCourseWare

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,060
or something else, right?

288
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Mm-hmm.

289
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,240
You've reminded me of something.

290
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,370
So the team member who
recommended Cynthia

291
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,040
was also mentoring her
during that process.

292
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,220
And one of the courses is
something called automata--

293
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,950
I forgot the full
name of the course.

294
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,500
And whatever problem he
was working on at the time,

295
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,670
he was like, oh, goodness.

296
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,440
There something in
the automata class

297
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,560
that he was helping Cynthia
with that he recognized

298
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,730
could help him solve a problem
that he was working on.

299
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,360
Yeah.

300
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,890
So it's almost like--

301
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,890
yeah, it's almost like this
extended hook in the learning.

302
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,930
It's not just for the person
who's going through it.

303
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,100
Because what we
also do is we want

304
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,760
them to present to us something
at the end of the coursework

305
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,790
on some topic.

306
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,240
So in Cynthia's case, for
example, it was graph theory.

307
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,860
Could you tell us what you
learned in graph theory?

308
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,450
So what happens is there's a
re-learning also for someone

309
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,510
like me.

310
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,880
And then I remember
there's some algorithm--

311
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,270
I forget which
algorithm she presented.

312
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,510
And I was like, oh, my God.

313
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,180
This is an insight I had in
terms of these kinds of nodes

314
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,600
I was thinking
about in the network

315
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,020
design for the logistics.

316
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,008
And I couldn't remember
that I had been taught this.

317
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:40,550
I don't even know
if I was taught it.

318
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,500
But I was like--

319
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,940
it was very validating for
me because I'm like, oh, wow.

320
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,250
I recognize something by
myself that isn't a textbook.

321
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,270
[LAUGHS]

322
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,770
Yeah.

323
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,270
No.

324
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,215
It feels pretty great.

325
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,260
[LAUGHS]

326
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,650
I love it.

327
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,052
I love it.

328
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:59,020
Ans that's a part of the joy
of teaching and learning.

329
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,860
And some of that happens
in the classroom,

330
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,970
but it happens our whole lives.

331
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,880
So let me turn now and ask
sort of a bigger question.

332
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,120
I've shared a
little bit about why

333
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,190
MIT does this-- the
big so-what question.

334
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,010
And I want to hear
from you a little bit

335
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,860
about the kind of impact
that you try to have.

336
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,560
I mean, you have not
just developed a company.

337
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,050
You've also-- you've been
involved in and starting

338
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,170
nonprofits.

339
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,240
You've been trying to make
an impact in the world.

340
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,960
And I wonder what advice you
would give to other people,

341
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,420
to the younger
version of yourself,

342
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,200
or someone who's out there
today, for how they could--

343
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,790
how they can make a difference.

344
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,290
Hmm.

345
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,902
I think the impact
question is big.

346
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:46,860
I don't know what I would
tell my younger self.

347
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,310
But I think I can
think of what to tell

348
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:58,920
other folks, which is for me,
there are certain kinds of--

349
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:06,072
the ideas or problems that
latch on to me so viscerally,

350
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:09,290
that I feel I have
no choice but to get

351
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,000
involved in solving the problem
or addressing the problem.

352
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,960
And when I have that emotion,
I just pursue the emotion.

353
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,339
I think that's
behind the nonprofit.

354
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,370
So the nonprofit we have is
called ZOO Memorial Foundation.

355
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,970
And what we do is we equip
community centers and schools

356
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,760
in very rural underserved places
with computers and computing

357
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,020
education.

358
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,340
And that is linked to my dad.

359
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,910
So my dad was an
electrical engineer.

360
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,280
Unfortunately, he died
when I was quite young,

361
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,800
more than 20 years ago.

362
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,575
But I would hear
stories of folks saying,

363
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:54,720
oh, he showed me
my first computer.

364
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,630
Or the first time I touched
a computer was with your dad.

365
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,110
Or he taught me
this or whatever.

366
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:07,440
And I wanted to do something
to continue, let's call it,

367
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,230
his work.

368
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,970
And that's how--

369
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,020
And a little tiny story.

370
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,700
I worked for this
company called EMC

371
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,100
in Hopkinton, a data
storage company that's

372
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,390
now acquired by Dell.

373
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,500
And it was Earth Day, and
they were recycling computers.

374
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,330
Like, there was some email where
computers were being recycled.

375
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,310
And can I just say, I
was crying at my desk.

376
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,710
I'd broken up with some person.

377
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,890
And I see this email.

378
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,820
I'm like, wait.

379
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,570
I stopped crying.

380
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,560
And I'm like, I know what we
could do with those computers.

381
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,110
And those computers end up--

382
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,810
long story short, we
end up kicking off

383
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,320
the nonprofit that way by
refurbishing these things.

384
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,150
With the company,
in terms of how

385
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,420
I got interested in logistics,
I just was so frustrated.

386
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,020
I was moving quite a
bit in a short period,

387
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,283
and just moving was so
awful And I was like,

388
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,200
people have been moving
since time immemorial.

389
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,120
Why does moving suck so much?

390
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,920
And I just got sucked
into logistics.

391
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,380
Not that I had necessarily
a passion for logistics,

392
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,010
but it was a nagging problem.

393
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,930
And then I'm also very big
on not regretting things.

394
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,130
I'm very big on the
regret minimization thing.

395
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,200
So I tend to just ask
myself at any given point,

396
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,520
if life ended
today, would this--

397
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,980
would I feel OK about
where my life has reached?

398
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,370
And sometimes the answer is yes,
and sometimes the answer is no.

399
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,610
And I find it's yes
when I feel I've

400
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,620
done something that
was meaningful to me

401
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,890
and seen it through completion
or a good outcome or something

402
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,970
that could continue.

403
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,470
And I find that it's no when
I'm in the middle of something.

404
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,262
I'm like, oh, wait.

405
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:39,910
I have this thing to do.

406
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,520
Yeah.

407
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:48,570
So for me, I just move with what
grips me, I think, I would say.

408
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,070
Yeah.

409
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,890
No, that's a fantastic story.

410
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,850
I appreciate that-- those
kind of personal connections

411
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,290
that whether it's with a
family, with just a moment that

412
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,990
hits you, that we
feel things, and then

413
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,690
we reach out and act on them
and build either as individuals

414
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,120
or with others.

415
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,870
Is there a role
for open education

416
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,870
in moving from that visceral
feeling to the doing?

417
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,170
I mean, for sure.

418
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,930
But I would just
add just one point

419
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,738
to my earlier one is to
also just go for it, even

420
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,530
if you don't know how
it's going to end up.

421
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,160
So in the story of the
nonprofit, what I did was I

422
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,790
just wrote the company
back and I said,

423
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,550
could you give me
those computers?

424
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,590
And then before I knew it, they
were interested in the idea.

425
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,660
Then me and my colleagues were
refurbishing the computers,

426
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,590
and then they were
donating money.

427
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,885
I just never foresaw that.

428
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:48,260
I was like, give
me the computer.

429
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,070
So folks should just start.

430
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,430
And then in terms of
with Open Learning.

431
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,160
So after I-- at some point,
I think earlier in the year,

432
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,530
late last year, maybe
a year ago, I posted--

433
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,730
I did a LinkedIn post
about the coursework.

434
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:16,610
And the response was pretty
good in that folks said,

435
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,470
we didn't know we
could learn this way.

436
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:25,640
Or can you show me where
I could complement this--

437
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,985
where I could mine
courses for my company?

438
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:30,360
So a friend of
mine, for example,

439
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,440
runs a rose farm in Kenya.

440
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,190
And she's in agriculture, so
her problems are different.

441
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,180
And she asked if I could help
figure out how they could also

442
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,860
use Open Learning.

443
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,310
And in her case, it's a company
of 800 people, many of them

444
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,630
are farm workers.

445
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:56,510
So how one would think about
what kinds of lessons one

446
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,790
could glean from something
such as Open Learning

447
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,820
is very different.

448
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,630
It's a very, very wide scope.

449
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,760
So for me, I think it's pretty
applicable in just about every

450
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,130
scenario-- the classes
on how to think--

451
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,510
making decisions, for example.

452
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,900
For me, I have
this deep interest

453
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,120
in behavioral economics, just
how one thinks about when you're

454
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,950
building technology,
but the behavior

455
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,590
of folks, which is
always not how we

456
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,933
think about things rationally.

457
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,350
Like, how do you
think about this?

458
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,160
So for me, in almost
every setting,

459
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,760
I think somebody
can find something

460
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,140
in Open Learning that's going
to complement that thinking,

461
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,330
whether it's
something pretty basic

462
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,300
or something pretty advanced.

463
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,180
All right.

464
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,750
OK.

465
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,860
No, that's inspiring, and I'll
borrow that line-- just start.

466
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,620
We'll sort of-- I
think a lot of people

467
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,790
will take that away
from our conversation.

468
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,780
And speaking of all those other
people, it's time now, I think,

469
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,298
to pivot.

470
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,340
And now I think it would
be a great chance for us

471
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,048
to take some questions
from the audience.

472
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:07,950

473
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,680
All right.

474
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,930
So, June, I wanted to just start
with one question that came in

475
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,900
from the audience from
one of our-- online

476
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,830
from Mary, who was
listening in and hearing

477
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,080
about the ways in which
you've talked about how you've

478
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,780
upskilled your workers and
yourself on the technical front.

479
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,760
But one thing that
Mary is asking

480
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,910
is how or what
recommendations you

481
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,310
would have for
helping people develop

482
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,230
their social skills
in communication,

483
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,760
in leadership, in networking?

484
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,373
Have you found
resources to do that?

485
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:45,040
And have you done
that in your own work?

486
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,280
And how have you helped
people in Senga Technologies

487
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,760
do that as well?

488
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,600
Hmm.

489
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,100
OK.

490
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,780
So I think-- hi, Mary.

491
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,610
First, thank you
for your question.

492
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,400
So for communication I think--

493
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,370
many of my colleagues
used to do Toastmasters,

494
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,590
and that worked for them.

495
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,220
So if Toastmasters is
around you somewhere,

496
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,990
I would recommend
that because I think

497
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:17,020
many people can write well or
communicate through writing.

498
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,455
And it sort of--

499
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:24,010
communicating verbally or in
public spaces or in meetings,

500
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,880
that tends to be difficult,
maybe because of confidence

501
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,780
or that kind of a thing.

502
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,270
So I would recommend something
as simple as Toastmasters.

503
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:40,350
Something that was useful
to me was learning tips

504
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,670
on something called
executive presence.

505
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,920
I remember looking at
executive presence tips

506
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:54,105
very early in my career, things
like sit up when you're talking,

507
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,560
how you should stand
and things like that.

508
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,040
For me, I found those to be
super, super, super valuable,

509
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,750
especially in the
early days when

510
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,410
trying to establish my career.

511
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:13,360
For my team, I think the current
generation is facing, I think,

512
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,910
a different set of
communication problems, I think,

513
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,860
than that we used to face.

514
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,590
For us, it used to be a
lot about public speaking.

515
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,070
But I think because of
a lot of social media

516
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:31,920
and so on, what I see commonly
is writing challenges, or being

517
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,870
very curt in writing--

518
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,090
very, very brief.

519
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,730
So for our team, the thing
that I'm usually pushing on

520
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,836
is just written communication.

521
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:44,380

522
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,790
I don't like to see slides
or that sort of a thing.

523
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,000
I want someone to
express their idea

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,520
in writing and with the correct
spelling and things like that.

525
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,450
And I will send it
back if it is not--

526
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,470
if it doesn't meet
that standard.

527
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah.

528
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,220
So I think it just
depends on where

529
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,180
someone is in their career, what
their background is and so on.

530
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,950
And just also observing.

531
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:12,460
If there's someone who one
admires, who speaks well,

532
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,790
I think there's nothing
wrong in emulating that.

533
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,510
Yeah.

534
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,240
Yeah.

535
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,520
No, I think that,
among other things,

536
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,530
one of our most popular videos
on MIT OpenCourseWare is from

537
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:28,150
the late Professor Patrick
Winston entitled "How to Speak."

538
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,810
And it's been picked up millions
of times, millions of views.

539
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,220
And I think it's just an
indication of the importance not

540
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,598
only of mastering technical
content or business

541
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,140
content or other
things, but actually

542
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,550
being able to express
it and to share it.

543
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,160
I'll look for it now.

544
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,130
[LAUGHS]

545
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,010
You had mentioned,
actually, the importance

546
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,180
of emulating a
public speaker as one

547
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,910
path toward developing someone's
personal public speaking skills.

548
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,590
And that brings me
to another question.

549
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:05,140
This came in from Rodrigo, who
has also a joined us an online

550
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,720
and sent this via
email, who asks,

551
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,200
who was your most
influential professor?

552
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,650
So who most influenced
you as you were learning

553
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,040
and whether that was in
the classroom or outside?

554
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,110

555
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,690
Hi, Rodrigo.

556
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,220
Oh, that is a
difficult question.

557
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,570
I got along so well
with my professors.

558
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,980
[LAUGHS] And even
professors in my school

559
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,430
who were not
teaching me directly.

560
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,630
One of the people I think
who was most impactful to me

561
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,870
was this guy called
Professor Moloney

562
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,510
who worked at EMC, which
I ended up joining.

563
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,420
He was not my professor,
but we got along.

564
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,970
And then, I got an internship at
EMC that I ended up not taking.

565
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,590
And then I got a
full-time position.

566
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,530
And I don't think I would
have gotten that without him

567
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,100
because I had not imagined
working for a company like that

568
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,540
or an industry like that.

569
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,040
Yeah.

570
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,560
I think Fred Martin is
someone who stands out to me.

571
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,690
Oh, my goodness.

572
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,660
He was an MIT Grad, actually.

573
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,760
I think now he is--

574
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,910
he might be dean of the CS
Department of University

575
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,360
of Texas at Austin.

576
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,860
Yeah.

577
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,540
So I didn't really enjoy very
much my hardware courses.

578
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,660
[LAUGHS] But he was my
professor, and he made

579
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,020
it fun, and I did well.

580
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,280
And I think I purely did
well because he was great.

581
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,780
Yeah.

582
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,958
So yeah.

583
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:33,500
I don't know.

584
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,010
I love academia.

585
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,790
I love many people.

586
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,700
So I really cannot
pick just one person.

587
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,920
I cannot.

588
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,130
No, that's a great point.

589
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,550
In many ways, part of
the joy of learning

590
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,430
is learning from different
people in different ways.

591
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,510
And so sometimes there is one
individual teacher or professor

592
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,480
who makes that huge
difference, but sometimes it's

593
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,640
the range of them that makes
all the difference in the world

594
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,660
and why we need to keep learning
and keep finding new voices,

595
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,680
new mentors as we move in
different parts in our lives.

596
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,300

597
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,590
Nice.

598
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,230
And so one thing--

599
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,060
another question
that has come in,

600
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,320
and I think this is really
important for a valuable-- sort

601
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,900
of insight that might be
valuable to other people who

602
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,490
are looking to use MIT'S open
resources in training employees

603
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,360
in their organization, which
is the question of assessing

604
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,950
the impact and the learning.

605
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,280
So a lot of our
course offerings,

606
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,280
particularly on MIT
OpenCourseWare, they're open.

607
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,987
They're self-paced.

608
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,320
There's no sort of necessarily
metrics of whether you've

609
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,410
passed or failed.

610
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,200
Our MITx courses do
have assessments.

611
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,820
They do have certificates
for people who complete them.

612
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:57,380
But for you, as a manager and
as the CEO, how did you know?

613
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,030
How did you measure, or did you,
your employees when they were

614
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:07,010
using MIT's open resources,
were mastering the material,

615
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,510
that they were
learning to apply it,

616
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,020
and they actually
really were making

617
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,776
a difference in their work.

618
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:12,276
Mm-hmm.

619
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,240

620
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,440
Well, in our case, I
would say the measure--

621
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,560
there were three kinds of
measures, though I think one--

622
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,505
well, one is not--

623
00:30:24,505 --> 00:30:27,740
[LAUGHS] I don't know
how useful it was,

624
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,510
which was do the
exercises in the course.

625
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,110
Don't just listen
to the classes.

626
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,450
Do the exercises,
and then report.

627
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,020
It was self-reporting, which
is why I don't know how--

628
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,520
I don't know what we
can say about that.

629
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,910
But self-report on
how you performed.

630
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,570
Because at some point,
answers are given,

631
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,770
and you can see whether
you got something correct.

632
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,710
So that was one.

633
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:56,945
And then the second measure was
actually the pace of learning.

634
00:30:56,945 --> 00:31:02,680
One can tell how one is doing
based on whether somebody

635
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,290
is taking too long or
something like that,

636
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,310
just like what's going on.

637
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,330
And then also asking
questions because we're

638
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,760
familiar with the material
because we are technologists.

639
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,890
And then also, asking
the team member

640
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,860
who's going through it
to present on a key topic

641
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,230
at the end of it.

642
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,390
So to present well, you
need to at least master

643
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,420
at a theoretical level what
it is you're going to present.

644
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,170
Because we-- all of
us gather together,

645
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,300
and you need to make a case.

646
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,910
And we're learning and
answering-- asking questions

647
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,940
that we want answers from.

648
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,320
So those were some of
the ways to measure.

649
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,400
And then the last one, I would
say, is just application.

650
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,910
Because our ultimate intention
is that the way of thinking

651
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,150
about a problem is reshaped.

652
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,950
So then the proof
of the learning

653
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,930
is in the pudding, which
is your actual output

654
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,840
once you start solving
problems within the team.

655
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,680
Yeah.

656
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,280
No, I think--

657
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,560
And I just want to
add something on this.

658
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,410
So one of my very
close friends is a--

659
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,430
I was about to say
he's a CTO, but he's

660
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,730
now a CEO at this
financial technology firm

661
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,750
here that's doing really well.

662
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,710
And he has helped recruit
just about every engineer

663
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,970
in our company.

664
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,650
And we've been talking
about recruitment

665
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:42,160
a lot because of these GPTs that
help people answer questions.

666
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,210
Once upon a time, you
could give a coding exam

667
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:52,020
and you watch somebody do it And
now, somebody can do it online.

668
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,930
And then credentials,
like I've mentioned

669
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,880
before, I think even
earlier in this chat,

670
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,390
that having a computer science
degree is very important to us.

671
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,470
He challenged me on that,
actually, quite a bit.

672
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,120
And he is someone who also
holds like a master's and--

673
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,540
a bachelor's and master's
in computer science.

674
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:18,900
We're changing the way we
hire to test problem-solving.

675
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,657
And yeah.

676
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:22,490
So it's actually no
longer about credentials

677
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,115
because we have had experience,
and I think many employers have

678
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:27,680
had this, where folks can have
the most amazing credentials,

679
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,055
and they still
can't do the work.

680
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,565

681
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:33,580
And what I'm finding
also is folks

682
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,180
who are self-directed and
have a lot of deep interest--

683
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,500
and I this was true, too,
when I was an engineer myself.

684
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,350
The best engineers
ended up being

685
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,100
folks who just, for whatever
reason, they chose that career,

686
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,750
and they didn't
actually necessarily go

687
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,890
through a machine
like me for learning.

688
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,560
For whatever reason, they
just had this deep passion,

689
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,550
and they opted in.

690
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:03,620
And I think that's where some
things, such as Open Learning,

691
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,060
becomes very powerful.

692
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,960
And actually, someone
added me on LinkedIn.

693
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,770
And when I looked
at his profile,

694
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,330
he had switched his career
to finance or something

695
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,870
just from Open Learning.

696
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,739
I literally just looked
at his profile yesterday--

697
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,859
complete switch of a career.

698
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:25,260

699
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,840
People see good work.

700
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,969
People see good work.

701
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,449
The world is changing.

702
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,480
It's hard to argue with
folks who work hard.

703
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,370
Yeah.

704
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:34,931
Yeah.

705
00:34:34,931 --> 00:34:36,389
No, I think those
are great points.

706
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,179
And I think the proof is
in the pudding, as you say.

707
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,510
And I would also pull
out the importance

708
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,000
of knowing that
someone has learned it

709
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,690
by having them present on it.

710
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,929
They always say the best way to
learn something is to teach it

711
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,770
and to be able to
teach it to others.

712
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:01,640
And also, that sort of
self-pacing, self-ownership.

713
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,300
So, in some ways you're
opening learning opportunities

714
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,710
to people in your firm,
but it's really up to them

715
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,830
to track their
progress, to apply it.

716
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,238
And that that's the best
way for them to learn it.

717
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,780
But I think the number one thing
I'll take from what you just

718
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,830
said is that phrase "opt in,"
of just opting in to learning,

719
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,570
to curiosity is really key to
what it means to be an agile

720
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,770
worker in the 21st century.

721
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:33,220
These technologies are
changing so rapidly.

722
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,830
And that even the best degrees
won't last anyone for a lifetime

723
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,365
anymore, if they ever did.

724
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:42,370

725
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,483
So let's-- I want to switch
now to a little bit--

726
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:47,400
some of the questions
that have been coming in

727
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,670
are really about and your
work and your journey.

728
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,290
So I'm going to turn some
of those to you right now.

729
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,370
And so one of the things that
comes from Mark along the way,

730
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:04,230
is a question about what's the
most valuable lesson that you've

731
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,660
learned as an entrepreneur?

732
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,570
You've reflected a little
bit in our conversation

733
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,100
about being an entrepreneur.

734
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,778
What's one that you
would share with Mark?

735
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:19,620
Oh, Mark.

736
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,150
Hi.

737
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,365
That is a tough,
tough, tough question.

738
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:30,570

739
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:38,305
Most valuable-- so first, I
think entrepreneurship is more--

740
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:41,800

741
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,685
for me, it's a
career of the heart.

742
00:36:45,685 --> 00:36:51,650
[LAUGHS] Because it's just so
difficult to be an entrepreneur.

743
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,930
Everyone's read about
the roller coaster

744
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:01,060
emotions and the
difficulty and maybe

745
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,180
getting financing and
product-market fit

746
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,590
and all these things.

747
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:11,820
I mean, the reality is
much, much, much tougher

748
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,200
than one will ever
read anywhere.

749
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,710
Or even if you have friends
who are entrepreneurs,

750
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,440
and you are observing them--

751
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,530
it's just one of those things
where you can't actually

752
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,980
explain what it's like
to be an entrepreneur.

753
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,860
You just have to experience it.

754
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,910
And that's why I think-- like,
my mom is a businesswoman.

755
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:39,360
And the times she
told me the way--

756
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,340
the things she's
pursued, it's when

757
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,060
she can't sleep over something.

758
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,500
And it's persistent, and she
just cannot run away from

759
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,390
an idea.

760
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:55,230
And I think entrepreneurship
is, or should

761
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,440
be-- should be driven
by that kind of thing,

762
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,860
a kind of obsession
because there's

763
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,040
so many things that are
happening to make you

764
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,060
want to quit.

765
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,620
And just to give you an idea.

766
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,360
I know very many entrepreneurs.

767
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,060
I know entrepreneurs who
do not have resources,

768
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,370
who have a lot of resources.

769
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,300
But all of them sort
of suffer the same--

770
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,070
the kinds of emotions
they suffer are universal.

771
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,730
So I think if it's not
driven by something internal,

772
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,150
it can be very challenging.

773
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,050
I mean, of course,
there are people

774
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,300
who are just super
rational about it,

775
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,660
and they have a time plan.

776
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
And in three years, they're out.

777
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,740
And they've sold their
company and whatever.

778
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,890
They know how to do it
like an assembly line.

779
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,640
But yeah, I would say- yeah.

780
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,580
I think the heart piece
is probably-- for me,

781
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,080
it's the thing
that's kept me going.

782
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,676
And therefore, I would
say that's the lesson.

783
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:52,870
No, that's fantastic.

784
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,340
That sticking to it
is really important.

785
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,590
And that's-- so that's also
a question that comes in from

786
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,830
YouTube from
Christopher who asks,

787
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,660
how do you stick to
your learning goals?

788
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,610
So in some ways, it's
that related question.

789
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,390
Is the answer there the same?

790
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,480

791
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,210
Hi, Chris.

792
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,070

793
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,370
I think let me talk a little
bit about my primary learning

794
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:34,300
right now, which is reading a
lot of biographies from founders

795
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,580
and founder podcast.

796
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:42,370
I love, love, love this podcast
called Founders, which is--

797
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,760
and in the definition,
founder is not

798
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,570
just someone who
started an enterprise,

799
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,050
but historical people who've
just done enormous things.

800
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,450
So it's anyone from a
Rockefeller to Oprah--

801
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,510
just standouts.

802
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,030
And so I'm a bit
obsessed with that.

803
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,010
And so basically this guy
called David Senra just

804
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,420
summarizes these books.

805
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,420
So I end up buying
some of those books.

806
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,310
And then subscribing
to something

807
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,800
called Founders Notes, which
is a summary of the books.

808
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,650
And I literally have five
of those up on my screen

809
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,130
all the time just to refer to.

810
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,360
I'm not measuring my
learning right now

811
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,190
as something around breath.

812
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,220
So it's not-- I don't
need to have a wide scope.

813
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,260
For me, it's like the
depth of something.

814
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,930
And sometimes it's
just a singular concept

815
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,900
that I'm sticking on.

816
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,720
And then that concept is
changing because sometimes it's

817
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,820
something about what
makes a great team.

818
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,800
But sometimes it's how do
you apply technology, like

819
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,450
in our case, even
internally, not just

820
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,990
externally for our customers.

821
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,330
And then I'd
mentioned-- for example,

822
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,190
I like something like
behavioral economics.

823
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,370
So I have Richard Taylor's book.

824
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,140
And then-- there's
just a set of books

825
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,270
that I just keep in front of
me, even if I haven't read them.

826
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,570
Sometimes I'll just pick
and try to go and see

827
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,180
if it's referring to something.

828
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,920
So I don't have a specific goal.

829
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,820
I would say for me,
it's a moving target.

830
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,100
And then I just find
that at any time

831
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,470
when I'm struggling with
a particular concept,

832
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:23,390
for whatever reason, if
something pulls me to it.

833
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:28,100
We're building some kind
of a document reader using

834
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,530
something called Clover.AI.

835
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,960
I think I saw someone
post on LinkedIn

836
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,290
this paper by these students.

837
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,040
And I was like, oh,
let me just read this.

838
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,260
And then it ends up
being this thing that's

839
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,583
now a very, very
key part of what

840
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,750
we're offering as a company.

841
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,950
So yeah.

842
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,370
So sometimes-- it's
just clicking now.

843
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,090
I don't have a calendar.

844
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,400
I don't have a list of
things I have to learn.

845
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,890
Yeah.

846
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,867
That's good to know.

847
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:53,700
That's good to know.

848
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,190
Because I think for someone
who's hearing your story

849
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,810
imagines that it's all
very disciplined, all very

850
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,630
by the book.

851
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,400
So it's very heartening
to know that sometimes you

852
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,000
just fall down a rabbit
hole and just discover.

853
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,960
And that's good
because that's actually

854
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,310
one of the questions that
came in on YouTube from Agay

855
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:25,040
was asking about whether it's
better to be more systematic

856
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,150
or to go down these
numerous rabbit holes?

857
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,930
And I think I'll take a stab
at answering that question,

858
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,940
that I think it's important
to do a little bit of both,

859
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,150
that sometimes there is a
need-- if you know that there's

860
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,260
a particular skill that
you need to master to try

861
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,430
to find a path to doing that.

862
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,520
And here are on Open
Learning, we're developing

863
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,470
and we'll be rolling
out new tools

864
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:58,950
for people who come to our
website to actually find

865
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,740
guided pathways
through our learning--

866
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,760
through their own
learning journeys.

867
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,340
So if they say, I want to
understand this corner of data

868
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,680
science, or I really
need for my work

869
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,998
to be able to understand
how vaccines work.

870
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:17,290
And that'll be coming over
the course of the next year.

871
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,580
So I encourage people to
come back early and often

872
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,860
over the next few months as
we roll those things out.

873
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,250
But there's also--

874
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:31,680
I think what our YouTube viewer
described as a rabbit hole,

875
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,680
another term for
that is serendipity,

876
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,977
which is never quite know.

877
00:43:36,977 --> 00:43:38,310
And you gave an example of that.

878
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,160
You stumbled across
a post on LinkedIn.

879
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,150
You followed the links, and
it led you in a new direction.

880
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,110
And so I wish--

881
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,660
for my answer to that question
to our friend on YouTube,

882
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:57,080
is I wish I knew which
things were serendipitous,

883
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,680
door-opening, transformative
experiences, which are just

884
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,300
rabbit holes.

885
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,030
And I'm not sure you
know it until you see it.

886
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,620
Is that your experience?

887
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,585
Serendipity is my favorite word.

888
00:44:09,585 --> 00:44:12,076
Oh, great.

889
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:12,576
Yeah.

890
00:44:12,576 --> 00:44:13,076
Yeah.

891
00:44:13,076 --> 00:44:19,530
It's my-- I feel that that's
what guides me personally.

892
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,110
And so when do you turn from
serendipity to structure?

893
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,990
That's probably what
people who are--

894
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,220
the difference between
a creative person

895
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,250
with entrepreneurial
ambitions and an entrepreneur

896
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,310
like yourself.

897
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,080
So how do you turn from
serendipity to structure?

898
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,900

899
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,600
I don't even know how to answer
that question because I feel

900
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,490
these things go hand in hand.

901
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,040
You've heard those
sayings around--

902
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,900
like, opportunity
comes when you're ready

903
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,590
and things like that.

904
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,400
So I see it very much like that.

905
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,210
I mean, day-to-day as
a company, for example,

906
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:08,800
we have a plan that
needs to be structured.

907
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,460
But I also typically say that we
have an emergent strategy, which

908
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,520
is, yes, we have this plan,
and we're supposed to--

909
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,500
what we think we should
do is go down this path.

910
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,430
But at the same time,
we're taking in information

911
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,280
to see if there's new data
that says maybe there's

912
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,768
something we can change.

913
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,030
Sometimes the thing that
makes you change that strategy

914
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,930
is what we can call serendipity
because you something

915
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:37,530
catches you.

916
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,810
And then it brings
together this other thing

917
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,430
that you had learned,
but it allows

918
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,830
you to see it in a new way.

919
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,670
Or it opens up a path for you
to go further that you wouldn't

920
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,770
even have foreseen yourself.

921
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,320
So I don't think
it's about turning

922
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,800
from structure to serendipity.

923
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,583
I mean, I think
these things coexist.

924
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:58,083
Right.

925
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,030
Oh, fantastic.

926
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,500
That's great advice.

927
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,720
So another-- this is
related, in some ways,

928
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,970
to a question that
came in from Nima.

929
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,020
And so Nima is asking,
in today's world,

930
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:17,160
sort of fast-moving, high-tech
world, how can someone best

931
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,320
learn quickly?

932
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,110
And then maybe I'd
also ask you to reflect

933
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,840
on what are the things
that you think people

934
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,380
need to be learning right now?

935
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,987

936
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:32,945
That's a good question.

937
00:46:32,945 --> 00:46:33,650
Hi, Nima.

938
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,760
Yeah, and I think
that kind of related.

939
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,123
So how do you learn quickly?

940
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:42,160

941
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,770
I think you learn quickly
by training yourself

942
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,720
to learn in the first place.

943
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,380
Yeah.

944
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,890
Yeah.

945
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,910
Like, I just noticed
something this week.

946
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,160
I was in a.

947
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,130
board meeting, and I hadn't
read the board pack on time.

948
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:01,720
And I felt very, very guilty
because that's a very bad thing.

949
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,990
And I open up-- it
was like 46 pages.

950
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:10,030
And I was able to go through
all the pages in a relatively

951
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,090
short time, and I ended up
asking the most questions

952
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,100
in that particular meeting.

953
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,615
And I was actually
surprised by myself.

954
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:20,240
And I realized, oh, once upon a
time when I was in grad school,

955
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,320
I was reading 100 pages a night.

956
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,760
And because I used to
read 100 pages a night,

957
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,070
now I can go through half of
that in a very quick period.

958
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,850
So I think learning fast is--
just training yourself to learn

959
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:41,727
and creating maybe environments
of focus while you're learning,

960
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,560
so that you can absorb
what you're learning.

961
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,340
Because then you're
going to feel better,

962
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,340
and you're going to notice
that you're learning.

963
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,423
And then it's just going
to get easier and easier.

964
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:54,190
I think it's-- learning is just
a muscle like anything else.

965
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,040
That's what I would say.

966
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,250
Absolutely.

967
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:57,750
Yeah.

968
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,000
And you also need, of course,
things like a clear mind

969
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,530
and that sort of thing.

970
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,260
So understanding the
kinds of environments

971
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,700
that allow you to learn better.

972
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,330
Because, for example,
if you've slept well,

973
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,890
you're going to learn
quicker, things like that.

974
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,140
Or maybe if you've had coffee.

975
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,150
I don't know.

976
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:19,170
And then-- [LAUGHS] I
drink a lot of coffee.

977
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,700
And then so the
other question was,

978
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,350
what should people learn now?

979
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,200
I have two reactions to that,
and I think even something

980
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,340
on the previous question.

981
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,630
So I'm not one of these people
who is a fan of learning fads.

982
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,350
I am anti them.

983
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,870
Like in this last decade
when folks are just like,

984
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,500
everyone should
learn how to code--

985
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,970
the last 10 to 15 years.

986
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,435
I'm like, come on.

987
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,560
We need people who are creative.

988
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,910
We need people who can market.

989
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:55,440
We need people who understand
philosophy and psychology and so

990
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,940
on.

991
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,540
They're very, very
important, even

992
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,380
in very, very technical areas.

993
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,980
So when I say that, I
think it's difficult for me

994
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,900
to pick what
someone should learn

995
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,030
because I think people
should learn the things

996
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,490
that they enjoy.

997
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,080
Otherwise, it's not--

998
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,370
I mean, you can know a lot
and do nothing with it.

999
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:26,460
But then if I had to pick
something to learn right now,

1000
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,720
I really, really
dislike this buzz of AI,

1001
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,050
especially as a CS person.

1002
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,670
The term is misused and
that sort of a thing.

1003
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:42,180
But we cannot deny the
super fast pace of things.

1004
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,840
We just cannot deny it.

1005
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,300
So if there's anything I would
say somebody needs to learn now

1006
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,690
is about the technologies
that are completely

1007
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,260
reshaping our landscape
because they're affecting us

1008
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,650
and will affect us,
whether we like it or not.

1009
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,420
And we just have to
get on board with them,

1010
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,610
and it's as simple as that.

1011
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,110
Yeah.

1012
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,650
No, I think you're right.

1013
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,610
And I think those are going
to transform every workplace.

1014
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:13,160
At the same time,
I couldn't agree

1015
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,830
more, the importance
that you've identified

1016
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,320
of people learning in
all different directions

1017
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,768
and following their passions,
whether they're in psychology

1018
00:50:23,768 --> 00:50:26,060
and economics and marketing--
all those fields that you

1019
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,960
mentioned.

1020
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,790
So this brings us, I think,
to the final question,

1021
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,130
which is directed at you.

1022
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,240
What will you be looking
to learn the next time you

1023
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,630
visit MIT OpenCourseWare?

1024
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,075
Well, outside of how to speak?

1025
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:44,940
[LAUGHS] That's the immediate
thing I'm going to look for.

1026
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,620
Great.

1027
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,950
That's fantastic.

1028
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1029
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,930
So that's a major thing
I'm going to look for.

1030
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,540
But outside of that,
still very interested

1031
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:58,370
in the sort of
behavior of things.

1032
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,150
And then I need
to use statistics.

1033
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,590
And I did not like
statistics once upon a time.

1034
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,750
I need to brush up.

1035
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,440
So just brushing up
on previous knowledge

1036
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,013
still, just because
of my day-to-day work.

1037
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:14,513
Right.

1038
00:51:14,513 --> 00:51:15,380
OK.

1039
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,700
Well, that's fantastic.

1040
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,930
And I hope you have some good
experiences the next time

1041
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:22,510
you visit MIT OpenCourseWare.

1042
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,010
Always.

1043
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,330
[LAUGHS] Always.

1044
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:31,140
So this was a wonderful
conversation with you, June.

1045
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,590
And I just want to
thank all of you who've

1046
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,950
joined online or elsewhere
for joining this conversation,

1047
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:43,400
sharing your experiences
either now or in other formats.

1048
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,790
And I think we all
share the enthusiasm

1049
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:51,470
that June brings to
learning, her creativity

1050
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,710
that she brings to her work.

1051
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,168
And I'm really glad
that we've been

1052
00:51:54,168 --> 00:51:57,200
able to share this
with the world.

1053
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,350
And I welcome you, on behalf
of all of Open Learning,

1054
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,180
to stay in touch
and to keep learning

1055
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,440
with MIT OpenCourseWare and all
of our Open Learning offerings,

1056
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,910
and encourage you to consider
supporting our work by sharing

1057
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,420
the resources that you encounter
with your friends and family

1058
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,750
and colleagues by sharing
your own experiences

1059
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,980
and your story directly
with us and the ways

1060
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,920
that MIT's Open Learning
resources have transformed

1061
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,830
your personal journey to
learning and to career

1062
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,060
transformation.

1063
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,180
And finally, for those of you
who are in a position to do so,

1064
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,430
we encourage and
invite you to consider

1065
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,090
making a donation that
would support our efforts

1066
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,120
and help us bring these
to the rest of the world

1067
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,670
as effectively as
we possibly can.

1068
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,890
So, for now, I'm
going to just say

1069
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,440
a final thank you to June
Odongo and to everyone

1070
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,240
who joined us online.

1071
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,130
Until our next
conversation, keep learning.

1072
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,270
Thanks very much.

1073
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,000
