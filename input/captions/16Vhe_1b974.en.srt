1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,199
in this video we'll look at a beautiful

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,160
result that provides us with the

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,000
existence of graphs with high girth and

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,000
high chromatic number and it's a very

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,519
nice demonstration of the power of the

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,599
probabilistic

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:32,040
method we'll recall some definitions

8
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,280
given a graph G its chromatic number is

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,520
the minimum number of colors we need to

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,239
color the vertices of the graph G so

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,600
that no Edge has both end points

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,840
receiving the same

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,640
color the girth of a graph G is the

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,360
length of the shortest cycle for example

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,360
the following

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
graph has scur

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,320
four because the shortest cycle in this

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,280
graph has length form and there are a

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,680
couple of

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,680
them another

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,799
example is this graph

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,040
here there are many cycles but the

23
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,720
shortest one has length three it is this

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,600
triangle up here so the girth is

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,600
three if the graph is a

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,759
tree then he has no cycles in which case

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,759
we say that its girth is infinite

28
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:38,159
okay so what can we say about girth and

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:44,600
chromatic number

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:48,240
well suppose your graph contains a

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,240
click on K

32
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:57,640
vertices then just to color this click

33
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,399
we need at least K different colors so

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,399
then the chromatic number

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,600
is at least

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,879
K can we say something in the reverse

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,840
Direction suppose we have a graph with

38
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,840
high chromatic

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,840
number would it be possible to deduce

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,840
some local information

41
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,480
about the graph for example would it be

42
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,560
possible to say that if we have very

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,920
high chromatic number then there must be

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,800
a triangle somewhere in the graph or

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,080
there's some fairly dense structure

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,360
that's very local in this

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,319
graph so the main theorem that we'll

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,840
present in this video gives a definitive

49
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,840
no to this question

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,640
and it is a classic result due to Paul

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
erish from the

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,000
50s and the statement of theorem is the

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,000
following for

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,400
any positive integers K and

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,400
L there exists

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,959
a

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,200
graph there exists a

58
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:52,239
graph with

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,239
girth

60
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,239
L girth bigger than L and chromatic

61
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,239
number

62
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,879
bigger than

63
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,040
K okay so let's pause for a moment and

64
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,319
think about what this theorem is saying

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,160
so given any K&L no matter how large we

66
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,000
can find a graph there exists a graph

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,440
for which there are no short Cycles no

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,880
cycles of length and most L and

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,479
furthermore to properly color the

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,880
vertices of the graph you need at least

71
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,440
you need strictly more than K colors

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,800
so even though this graph has very high

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,720
chromatic number around every vertex if

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,680
you only look not too far away then the

75
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,039
graph locally looks like a tree because

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,520
there are no short

77
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,720
Cycles so in particular having high

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,759
chromatic number does not give you local

79
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,960
information and eror shows that there

80
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,360
always

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,520
exists counter examples to such a

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,360
statement if we want some local

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:06,199
information from High chromatic

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,880
number okay so the rest of this video

85
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:12,759
will concern the proof of ERS

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,840
theorem it's quite a miraculous result

87
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,360
and certainly before ERS proved this

88
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,919
result there were other resulting graph

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:25,680
theory that constructed very explicit

90
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:28,960
graphs that have some large chromatic

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,759
number and girth but not for all values

92
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,440
of K and those constructions are in some

93
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,759
sense very Hands-On it tells you how

94
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,160
exactly how to construct these graphs

95
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,840
but they were not able to get

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,000
arbitrarily large girth and chromatic

97
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,000
number A's Insight is to use Randomness

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,280
use the probabilistic method and show

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,360
that by appropriately modifying a random

100
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:59,280
graph one can achieve the desired

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,280
outcome so let's see how this works

102
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:12,000
we'll Begin by taking an random graph

103
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,000
GNP so this is the a

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,919
r random

105
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,160
graph

106
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,160
and there nend vertices

107
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,319
and um The Edge probability is

108
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:43,960
p meaning that we flip a probability P

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,680
coin for each possible Edge and put down

110
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,440
an edge

111
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,800
independently with probability P between

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,800
every pair of

113
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
vertices

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:03,520
right so let G be drawn from this

115
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,520
distribution so G is this random

116
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,919
graph now

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,919
let's take a specific choice of

118
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:22,800
P being log n^ s Over N turns out other

119
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,720
choices of P work as long as P Falls in

120
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,199
some range but for concreteness we'll

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,120
take this very specific choice of P so

122
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,919
this is a random graph and let's

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,919
construct the random variable

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,879
X defined to be the number of

125
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,879
cycles of

126
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,680
length at most

127
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,560
l in G okay so these are short Cycles in

128
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,520
G and these are the cycles that we want

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,240
to avoid because we want to construct a

130
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,960
graph with girth strictly larger than l

131
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,240
so we really do not like these

132
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,599
Cycles it will be nice if there were not

133
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,199
too many such Cycles so let's compute

134
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:08,199
the expected value of

135
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,000
x for this computation we use linearity

136
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,720
of

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
expectations and look over all possible

138
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:21,759
cycle lengths from 3 to

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,400
L right so I is the target cycle length

140
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,240
and for cycles of length

141
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,319
I there are n choose I different choices

142
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,240
of

143
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,719
which I vertices the Cycles can

144
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:42,360
involve and once you specify those

145
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:44,640
vertices there are IUS one factorial

146
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,480
different permutations circular

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,640
permutations of these vertices and we

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,720
divide it by two

149
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,120
because a cycle could be counted in two

150
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,839
different directions and they will

151
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,120
correspond to the same

152
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:06,240
cycle so

153
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:09,079
so this quantity here is the number of

154
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:14,000
cycles of

155
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:17,000
length I in the complete graph on N

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,040
vertices with all edges

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,040
present for each such possible cycle the

158
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,200
probability that the cycle appears in G

159
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,600
is p to the I so the second term

160
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,440
here is probability

161
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,839
that

162
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,839
this

163
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,839
cycle

164
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,360
appears in

165
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,560
GMP okay this is some expression it's a

166
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,399
little complicated but we can simplify

167
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,519
it and do some approximations to Upper

168
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,880
bound this

169
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,160
quantity so you see that the

170
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,519
um n choose I if you expand it in terms

171
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,880
of

172
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:11,640
factorials one can upper bound this

173
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,200
quantity by n to the I so incorporating

174
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,640
the um the first two

175
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,640
factors and then leaving P to the I

176
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,640
factor

177
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:28,279
intact

178
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:32,959
okay we chose P so that P * n equals to

179
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,959
log s of M and

180
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,040
so we can rewrite this quantity

181
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,920
here like

182
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,160
this okay uh there are L terms here so

183
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
let

184
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,399
me furthermore upper bound this

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:05,760
expression by L Times log n to

186
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:08,800
the 2 L here L is a constant so this

187
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,720
quantity here is some growth and the

188
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,560
rate of some power of a log and

189
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,000
certainly

190
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,680
much slower growing compared to the

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,480
function n so it's little o of n okay

192
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,639
it's a fairly crude approximation but

193
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,360
will be sufficient for our

194
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,760
purposes so this is a calculation

195
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,519
conclusion can be read as the expected

196
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,560
number of short Cycles is fairly

197
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,399
small well if there are few short Cycles

198
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,320
we

199
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,399
can get rid of all of them to get a

200
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,760
graph without short Cycles so this is

201
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,920
the basic idea of the alteration method

202
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,480
in the probabilistic method okay so

203
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,600
start with this GMP this random

204
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,120
graph it's not going to get us what we

205
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,360
want right away but we're going to do

206
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,440
something to fix the defects in this

207
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,560
graph in this case get rid of short

208
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,560
Cycles to that end that is known that by

209
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,399
markov's

210
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,160
inequality the

211
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,199
probability that the number of short

212
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,519
Cycles here short means length and most

213
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:23,240
L the probability that the number of of

214
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:27,199
short Cycles X is at least n / two is

215
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:31,040
upper bounded by the expectation of x

216
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:34,959
divided by n /2

217
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,279
and because expectation of X is little o

218
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:43,519
of n this final quantity is little o of

219
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,519
one is the case to zero as n goes to

220
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,079
Infinity okay

221
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,560
so this is a good sign right so means

222
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,399
that typically the graph does not have

223
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,519
very many short Cycles has fewer than n

224
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,680
/ two and then eventually we'll be able

225
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,199
to get rid of one Edge from each cycle

226
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,560
to get us a graph with still fairly

227
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:10,560
large number of vertices but there are

228
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,680
no short Cycles left in this after the

229
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,440
alteration now let's think about

230
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,760
chromatic number so we want to ensure

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,160
that the graph that we end up having has

232
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,440
high chromatic

233
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,199
number to that

234
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,480
end we'll recall the following

235
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:33,839
fact if we give you a graph

236
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:38,480
G then the chromatic number of G so this

237
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,480
is Kai of G so that's the chromatic

238
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,560
number well the chromatic number is the

239
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,639
minimum number of colors that one need

240
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,240
to color the vertices of the graph so

241
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,160
that no Edge has the same color on both

242
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,839
sides in particular every color class

243
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,519
right so if you look at a single color

244
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,120
like red and look at the vertices

245
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,720
colored by that

246
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,680
color these vertices have no edges

247
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,120
directly between them and so they form

248
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,120
an independent set so each color class

249
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,000
is an independent set and so the number

250
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,480
of color classes you

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,680
need then should be at least the number

252
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,079
of vertices divided by the independence

253
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,399
number this is the size of the largest

254
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,399
independent set so this Alpha of the

255
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,839
independence number is the

256
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,600
size of the

257
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
largest independent

258
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,839
set indeed each color class is

259
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,120
independent set and each independent set

260
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,040
has size at most Alpha of G and

261
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,959
therefore the number of colors you need

262
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,120
should be at least the number of

263
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:01,040
vertices divided by the independence

264
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,040
number

265
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,680
okay now for

266
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,440
every

267
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,279
H the probability that the independence

268
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,920
number so after here see that it makes

269
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,120
sense to think about the independence

270
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,519
number the probability that Independence

271
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,160
number is bigger than

272
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,880
H

273
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,319
is and most the following so here we'll

274
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,399
use Union

275
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:36,000
sound for

276
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:40,399
each H vertex subset of which there are

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,360
n choose H such H vertex subsets the

278
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,920
probability that those H vertices from

279
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,440
an independent

280
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,120
set is the probability that there are no

281
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,319
edges appearing among these H vertices

282
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,319
and that's 1 minus P raised to the power

283
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,199
H choose

284
00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:00,800
two okay so this is some expression and

285
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,680
we can do some manipulations to simplify

286
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,240
this

287
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,600
expression yielding an upper bound of n

288
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,480
to the H times so the latter expression

289
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,440
we can simplify it as so upper bounded

290
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:23,000
by e to the minus

291
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:24,600
p h h -1 / 2 right so 1 minus

292
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,920
p

293
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,920
is less than e to the minus p

294
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,240
okay simplifying further we see that

295
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,240
this expression can be

296
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,040
Rewritten this

297
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:54,759
way and now let's make a choice for what

298
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:57,839
H I want to set so let's set H to be the

299
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,759
quantity which for now seems a little

300
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,800
mysterious but it turns out to be a

301
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,640
natural thing to set after we see what

302
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,439
the calculation looks like so we set H

303
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,400
to be this quantity three * log n over p

304
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,480
and knowing what P was from earlier uh

305
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,720
this quantity is 3 n

306
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,720
over log

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:27,600
n if we set H to be this quantity here

308
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:32,600
then you see that here in this

309
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:36,280
expression the numerator here um can be

310
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,280
simplified and the

311
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,720
result is that this expression de

312
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,640
case According to some rate which is n

313
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,919
to something that is a minus

314
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,919
constant something on a constant word in

315
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,159
particular it goes to zero as n goes to

316
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,320
infinity and that's really the only

317
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,080
thing that we need for uh that we need

318
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,840
out of this

319
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,320
calculation so if we set H to be of an

320
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,320
appropriate quantity then typically one

321
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,960
does not have independent sets of size

322
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,640
at least H in the

323
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,240
graph

324
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,280
okay so let's regroup so we proved a

325
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,840
couple of

326
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,240
things first we show that typically so

327
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,880
when I say typically I mean with

328
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,080
probability approaching one as Ang goes

329
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,159
to Infinity so typically this graph does

330
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,440
not

331
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:39,400
have short Cycles meaning cycles of

332
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,200
length and most L and also typically

333
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,400
this graph does not have large

334
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,280
independent

335
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,960
sets okay now let us put everything

336
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,120
together

337
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,120
so by

338
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,720
choosing and sufficiently large

339
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,080
we can

340
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,080
simultaneously ensure that the

341
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:20,840
probability that X the number of short

342
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,159
Cycles exceeds n /2 is strictly less

343
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,600
than

344
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:29,480
half and the probability that the

345
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,880
independence number

346
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,960
exceeds H is also strictly less than

347
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,080
half okay so both of these are quantity

348
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,480
quantities that decay to zero as n goes

349
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,320
to Infinity so by choosing sufficiently

350
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,240
r n we can make sure both probabilities

351
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,440
are strictly less than 1/2 and therefore

352
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,200
there is some possibility that lie

353
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,200
outside both

354
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,240
events thus there

355
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,480
exists a graph

356
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,360
G

357
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,840
with

358
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,720
fewer

359
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,799
than n / two

360
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:24,280
cycles of

361
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,280
length at most

362
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,000
L

363
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,480
and furthermore its independent number

364
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
the size of the largest independent set

365
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,880
is at

366
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,960
most H which we said earlier to be 3n

367
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,120
over log

368
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,520
n okay so we have such a graph G that

369
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,559
has these nice

370
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,280
properties well we're looking for a

371
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,840
graph with high girth well here G has

372
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,799
not too many short Cycles so we can get

373
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:04,240
rid of one vertex from each short

374
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,720
cycle to remove all the short Cycles so

375
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
remove a

376
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:15,679
Vertex from each short cycle the each

377
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,440
cycle of

378
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,440
length at

379
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,440
most

380
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,279
l so remove one vertex from each such

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,000
cycle and

382
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:36,200
doing so results in a subgraph g

383
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,320
Prime and then we know that the girth of

384
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,320
G

385
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,799
Prime is strictly larger than L because

386
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,320
we got rid of all the short

387
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:50,480
cycles and furthermore the chromatic

388
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,880
number of G

389
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,440
Prime is by what we saw earlier at least

390
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,240
the number of vertices of G Prime

391
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:04,039
divided by its independ

392
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,039
number well the number of vertices is at

393
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:11,240
least n / two because we removed at most

394
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:14,799
n /2 vertices from G to obtain G

395
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,799
Prime the independence number of G Prime

396
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,520
well the independence number of G

397
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:22,840
Prime is at most the independence number

398
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,760
of G because any independent set in G

399
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,159
Prime is automatically independent set

400
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,480
in G and here we saw that

401
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:36,120
the independent number of G Prime is at

402
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,640
most H which is three log n over 3 n

403
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,640
over log

404
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:47,960
n so we have in the denominator 3n

405
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
over

406
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,320
login

407
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,760
and whole expression simplifies to log n

408
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,720
/ 6

409
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,760
which is bigger than the constant that

410
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:09,480
we were given K as

411
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,480
long as n is sufficiently

412
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,080
large

413
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,080
and thus G Prime

414
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,080
satisfies the desired

415
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,799
requirements okay this finishes the

416
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,919
proof of this theorem of airush that

417
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,400
there exists graphs with arbitrarily

418
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,720
large girth and arbitrarily large

419
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,960
chromatic

420
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,840
number to review some of the key ideas

421
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,679
in this proof we use the probabilistic

422
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,559
method with alterations to construct

423
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,159
first a random

424
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:54,080
graph with various parameters so that

425
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,240
this random graph typically has very few

426
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,679
short

427
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,360
Cycles so that we can then remove one

428
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,600
vertex from each short

429
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,520
cycle and get rid of all the short

430
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:11,039
cycles and this is a way to ensure large

431
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:16,720
growth to obtain High chromatic number

432
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:20,279
we note that this graph typically

433
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,760
has typically does not have large

434
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,279
independent

435
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,039
sets and so its independence number is

436
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,960
typically small and therefore the

437
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,240
independence number of the subgraph must

438
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,360
be typically small as well and having

439
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,600
small Independence number implies High

440
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,760
chromatic

441
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,960
number okay so it's a beautiful

442
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,120
illustration of the probabilistic method

443
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,279
with alterations that allows us to

444
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,240
deduce this highly counterintuitive

445
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:50,919
result

446
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,960
which was U quite surprising because in

447
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,600
previously various researchers have

448
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,520
tried to construct such examples of

449
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,120
graphs by hand explicitly but

450
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,039
successfully and ERS brought this

451
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,240
beautiful Insight that introducing

452
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,919
Randomness by looking at random graphs

453
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,279
one can indeed prove the existence of

454
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,279
graphs with highly counterintuitive

455
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,279
properties
