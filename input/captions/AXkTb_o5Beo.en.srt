I'm so happy to be here um I so I think

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,199
the short story is I'm originally from

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
Texas I will always them Texas but I've

15
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,840
lived many places so those of you who

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,320
are coming um um from not the East Coast

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm happy to share that perspective as

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,480
well uh right before Sloan I was in the

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,280
greater New York area um so that's kind

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,840
of where um I ended up moving from when

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,960
I got to Massachusetts uh I uh was a

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,600
part of the stone fellows class of 2023

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
um I graduated last year and I'm happy

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,960
to talk a little bit about what that

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
Journey for me was like um as one of I

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,239
guess well the only executive um program

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,839
representation here but um my Pivot had

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,760
a lot to do with focusing on operations

29
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,680
infrastructure on the real estate side

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,920
wanting to switch Industries into the

31
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,200
automotive sector and focus on that

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,600
infrastructure side um and then kind of

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,400
shift out of the mode that I had been in

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,960
kind of starting up operations teams to

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,400
scaling up operations so that was um

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,759
kind of my focus while I was on campus

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,640

74
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,680
first question I have for our panelist

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,159
us a you know a a glimpse into your

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,640
thought process of why you chose Sloan

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,040
as your particular uh degree option for

79
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,599
the lgo program SLO fellows and our MBA

80
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,879

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,280

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,879
order yeah you can go ahead you can kick

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,239
us off Morgan okay happy to so um very

84
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,080
very very long journey um about four

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,159
years after undergrad um you know I'd

86
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,920
been in the workforce I was thinking

87
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:31,439
kind of what did I want to do next and

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,920
um it was clear to me because I was

89
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,959
already working in kind of the gr space

90
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,080
of starting up an operations team in

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,080
healthcare um that I wanted to have the

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,519
training um of that comes with the

93
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,080
business degree and as soon as I knew

94
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,879
that uh I knew that I wanted to go to

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,799
saloan or not go to business school at

96
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:55,720
all um I was very focused on Sloan I

97
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,560
mean in a kind of weird way um I visited

98
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,879
probably over four times I applied to

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,560
the diversity uh weekend and ended up

100
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,079
staying uh with a with a host um I knew

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
nearly everybody in the admissions

102
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,640
office um and it kind of was me checking

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
in every year and they were like are you

104
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,920
gonna apply and I'm like oh I don't

105
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,079
think I'm ready yet I don't think I'm

106
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,120
ready yet and um you know fast forward

107
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,440
about four and a half rolls later um I

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,000
think covid happened and I kind of sat

109
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,440
with this you know this was M this is a

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,759
dream um am I still serious about this

111
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,440
dream um you know I I and I I decided

112
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,440
yes right that MIT was the place for me

113
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,600
and so I just wanted to see if they felt

114
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,039
the same way and so I applied um and and

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,720
then ended up matriculating um just

116
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,600
after I I'll say the core covid season

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,639
so um starting in the fall of of

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,280
2022 um is when I entered um I guess

119
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,440
I'll just say two things on the on the

120
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,360
why slan um

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,320
I I felt very strongly about the way

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,320
that Sloan trains

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,840
its students and probably equally as

124
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,080
strong about like the type of student

125
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,360
that is at MIT at large right and so um

126
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,160
I think if you haven't heard it already

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
it

128
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,360
is very much true that this is a place

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,919
of kind of Silent doers and I felt like

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,919
that was in line with who I am um I love

131
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,039
tackling kind of the messy problems uh

132
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,880
with very talented people and have um

133
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,440
just so much excitement when when I'm

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,680
with those kinds of people and so I

135
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,400
think to find people that are kind of in

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,880
their own Lanes just achieving really

137
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,000
phenomenal things and wanting to

138
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,919
collaborate with them and feeling like

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,880
it could not only be true in my cohort

140
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,160
um across Sloan but also across MIT um

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,400
felt

142
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,560
like how could I how could I not take

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,360
advantage of this opportunity right so

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,520
as soon as I was admitted um I knew it

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,160
was a go um I think the other thing that

146
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,479
came became apparent for for me over

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,919
time is obviously when I was first

148
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,639
considering this path um four years out

149
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:11,479
of undergrad looks very different from

150
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,280
14 years later right so um I think it

151
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,240
ended up working out perfectly for me I

152
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,960
think I knew much more about where I

153
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,039
wanted to go uh professionally I was

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,520
much more assure of myself and I think

155
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,319
business school then was more of like a

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,599
gut check that you know because I had

157
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,560
never had the formal

158
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:32,000
training was I where where did I line up

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,800
right like is this kind of a self

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,240
assessment to come and back to school

161
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,560
and and see like you know where do I

162
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,400
need to kind of fine-tune things what

163
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,720
are my strengths where do I lean in um

164
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,080
and and so the slow fellow MBA ended up

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
being perfect for that right because

166
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,759
it's kind of the NBA but it's

167
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,440
fast-tracked it's with um it's it's like

168
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
without like the internship summer right

169
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,160
you're basically taking a very similar

170
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,199
um set of courses and um the

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,520
conversation for me was at the perfect

172
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,680
level right so like people who you know

173
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,400
may be coming from a non-finance

174
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,960
backgrounds got to take Finance with

175
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,720
people that are CFOs right or PE as as

176
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,960
myself an operator like like I got to

177
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,479
help people that are highly technical

178
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,000
right in thinking about how do you do

179
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,639
ops management and so um loved that the

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
conversation was at that level and I

181
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,720
also am very partial to The Faculty um

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
that we had uh leading us guiding us and

183
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,800
and happy to talk more about that

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,840
because that was actually um my greatest

185
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,879
networking tool was The Faculty

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,240
so thank you for sharing Morgan so Kai I

187
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,680
want to pass it over to you because I

188
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,800
know LG was a very Niche program given

189
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,479
the fact that it's a doal degree with

190
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,840
our School of Engineering so could you

191
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,720
give our audience a glimpse into your

192
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,400
thought process of you know why you felt

193
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,159
that LGL was a great fit for you

194
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,479
definitely so as a software engineer I

195
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,280
think I was a little bit intimidated by

196
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,039
MBA programs to be honest I because I

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,800
didn't have that business background and

198
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,400
so when I was looking into programs I

199
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,280
only really looked at dual degree

200
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,520
programs program that combined

201
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,599
engineering and business because I felt

202
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,360
like that was more of a comfort zone for

203
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,400
me because I had that technical

204
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,639
background I think when I looked at

205
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,360
different programs the reason why the

206
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,759
lgo program stood out to me so much was

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,280
because MIT was the first institution to

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,000
have a program like this to have a

209
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,759
business Master's and Engineering master

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,560
program combined and because of that it

211
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:32,039
has the kind of most uh you know large

212
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,200
Alumni network of these type of folks

213
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,399
and so for me I think that was one of

214
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,839
the most important thing that wherever I

215
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,719
went had a robust Alumni network and

216
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,600
Alumni network that was not only robust

217
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,560
but that was actively kind of engaged

218
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,080
and wanted to still like talk to

219
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,160
students help students give back and I

220
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,440
saw that in the in the ljo program that

221
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,399
there was a lot of willingness to um

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,600
still be engaged uh with the program and

223
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,760
still be engaged with students and help

224
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,160
and and that to me I think was a

225
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,399
differentiator and why I was interested

226
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,600
in in joining

227
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,079
LGL thank you K and and Nam could you

228
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,360
wrap us up as it pertains to your

229
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,399
experience you know within the pre-mba

230
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,720
phase and you know what stuck out to you

231
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,160
about SM of course um so first off I

232
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,560
mentioned that I have an engineering

233
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:28,279
background and what engineer

234
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,959
does um but um all jokes aside though

235
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:33,320
what the main thing for that stuck out

236
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:37,640
to me was um I mentioned I am Nigerian

237
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,519
and so mits work in Africa and also um

238
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,800
just the alums uh the Alumni network and

239
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,480
the reach of uh MIT was what really

240
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,160
pulled me in and then um once I started

241
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,120
to get to know the school door and get

242
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,720
to know like people who went there and

243
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,720
uh familiarized myself with the program

244
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,680
uh the one thing that also stuck out to

245
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,040
me was um the teamwork so MIT focuses

246
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,079
heavily on teamwork so you will hardly

247
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,040
ever do anything by yourself you're most

248
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,480
likely going to be in a team working on

249
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,160
different projects different uh problems

250
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,680
very very tough creative problems and so

251
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I think Morgan mentioned this earlier

252
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,760
just meeting very low Eco people who are

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,720
incredibly smart and just coming

254
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,600
together to work on things together that

255
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,399
was a huge um uh draw for me so the

256
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,839
culture of MIT the reach of MIT uh the

257
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,680
work they do in Africa was what really

258
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,640
uh pulled and also the Alumni network as

259
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,399
well so as I got to talking as I got to

260
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,160
start meeting and talking to different

261
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,800
people who went to MIT I got to know of

262
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,320
the phrase that was um a SL never lets

263
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,440
another SL fail and MIT folks take this

264
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,680
very seriously so I'd reach out to

265
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,600
people who were in you know different

266
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,000
levels of um leadership positions in

267
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,040
different organizations that I was

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
interested in uh while I was recruiting

269
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,839
and they went to MIT as as soon as they

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,120
saw the uh mit.edu I usually would get a

271
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,920
response um because once again it's like

272
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,519
hey you know this person went to slow

273
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,360
how can I help what can I do so just all

274
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,720
those factors were very instrumental in

275
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,000
drawing me in and ultimately uh making

276
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,600
me um choose to attend

277
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,839
MIT thank you all for sharing I know one

278
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,920
common thing that we've heard within

279
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,079
these particular responses is the

280
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,600
community at loan and how big that's um

281
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
that how big that is here at our

282
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,519
particular institution um so could you

283
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,200
kind of dive into uh the community at

284
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,760
Stone and you know talk about the things

285
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,200
that you were involved in as a student

286
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,360
and how you you know have uh inclusivity

287
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,519
as it pertains to the black business

288
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,079
Student Association or the Africa

289
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,079
Business Club and anybody can take that

290
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,480
one okay so I could start off uh so I so

291
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,200
I was a member of both

292
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,600
organizations um and so

293
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,399
essentially both organizations to me are

294
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,200
kind of intertwined in the sense that um

295
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,959
you know we have the Africa Business

296
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,800
Club but a lot of the members are also

297
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:10,399
part of the uh of bbsa and so um we had

298
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,240
you know just different meetings but Mo

299
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,120
most importantly I think what I got out

300
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,760
of it was really the community so

301
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,279
meeting people from you know um uh

302
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,480
different backgrounds like technical

303
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,839
backgrounds but then you share the same

304
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,199
you know um life experiences and things

305
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,880
like that and then you guys all come

306
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,560
together as a community and like really

307
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,120
helping each other it could be anything

308
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,079
it could be in recruiting it could be um

309
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,000
assignments what classes to take um from

310
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,639
the people another resource that I found

311
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,199
where from the second years when I was

312
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,639
the first year um what classes did you

313
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,680
guys take you know what what do old

314
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,560
exams look like you know can you help me

315
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,160
with this you know how how did you know

316
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,920
um um like pass questions I'm I'm

317
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,120
struggling in this class I need some

318
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,519
help can you tutor me can you help me

319
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,279
and they were usually very very helpful

320
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,480
like instrument telling me like you know

321
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,720
passing classes well and I I mentioned I

322
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,240
was a career switcher so leaning heavily

323
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,959
on people who had um Finance experience

324
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,279
to talk about like the experiences in

325
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,079
recruiting um what do I need to know

326
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,800
things like that so those were very very

327
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,600
instrumental and helpful in me

328
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,680
ultimately achieving my goals and then

329
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,240
once I became a second year I was also

330
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,600
able to try to help out with the first

331
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,040
years as well so really the culture of

332
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,440
giving back is also um something that is

333
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,120
very strong in the MIT community in the

334
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,120
MIT black black or diverse

335
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,720
Community yeah to just to follow up um

336
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,320
to what n was saying I was um on the

337
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,079
exec Board of the

338
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,880
bbsa um and so I think being a part of

339
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,480
that that Community especially from a

340
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,920
leadership position I think it was

341
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,920
really special to be with the other exec

342
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,160
board members and to try to figure out

343
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,839
like how we could create events and

344
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,839
opportunities and things for the

345
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,759
community um and just figuring out like

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,000
what the community needs how we can

347
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,120
especially I think like you were saying

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,360
that first year second year relationship

349
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,240
is really important and so like okay how

350
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,639
can we you know once you become second

351
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,680
year it happens so fast but you're like

352
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,440
okay how can I get back and support the

353
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,199
first year what resources that can we

354
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,560
you know put together to make sure that

355
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,880
they're well supported and so I really I

356
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,240
thought it was a really special

357
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,199
experience for me and I think um being a

358
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,480
part even as an lgo I never felt like I

359
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,000
you know I wasn't a part of the the MBA

360
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,920
Community I was you know just a member

361
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,120
as as anyone else even though you know I

362
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,120
had my engineering experience as well so

363
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
it was it was a great uh experience

364
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,240
being a part of the executive board and

365
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,279
be able to have that leadership and be

366
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,839
able to kind of pass the torch of

367
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,360
building Community for for the students

368
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,040
that were coming

369
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,639
in yeah and I'll Echo that you know I

370
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,720
think because I didn't have two years

371
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,800
right um I was I think Hy hper focused

372
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,680
on the um number of people that I wanted

373
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,519
to meet right and so one of the ways

374
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,639
that that was kind of extended outside

375
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,360
of my particular program was to join

376
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,519
right so I was I was also in the black

377
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,279
business Student Association um I was a

378
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,240
member of swim um and then I was also

379
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,120
very focused right on this pivot so um

380
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,639
basically every Mobility Club you can

381
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,199
imagine I was on the leadership um team

382
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,480
for um the space Club um and and the

383
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,839
automotive club and

384
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,920
um yeah I think I think those are all

385
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,000
the groups

386
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,519
yeah thank you off for Sharon there's a

387
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,959
a wide range of options for students to

388
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,160
be involved in while they're on campus

389
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,639
so there's over 80 plus clubs at Sloan

390
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,120
there are some affinity and identity

391
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,279
groups that we mentioned before with our

392
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,480
Africa Business Club our SLO women in

393
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,440
management or bbsa but also there's some

394
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,279
IND specific clubs as well so if you

395
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,079
have a specific area of interest there

396
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,160
are there is a club here for you and if

397
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,800
we don't have it you can go to Our Salon

398
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Center to be able to create a club here

399
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,000
as well so there's a lot of uh community

400
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,480
in within our particular program to

401
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,279
ensure that students have support as

402
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,720
they're navigating the social aspects of

403
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,279
school um versus the academic so that's

404
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,720
a great pivot for our next uh question

405
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,360
that I have so more so focusing on the

406
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,279
curriculum So within these three

407
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,079
different programs the curriculum looks

408
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,560
uh extremely different so can you all

409
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,279
talk about you know the curriculum at

410
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,600
loan and how it was built for you and

411
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,560
talk about the flexibility that it

412
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,120
offered as it pertains to the the the

413
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,959
MBA program and SL fellows I know K the

414
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,959
lgo program wasn't as flexible because

415
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,519
given that you have to have two degrees

416
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,959
but can you just kind of talk about ways

417
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,440
that you've the classes that you've

418
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,560
taken and how you were able to kind of

419
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,319
explore why you

420
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,800
ATL okay so I could us off again um so

421
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,680
for me uh the curriculum was the the MIT

422
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,680
curriculum was something that you know I

423
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,519
found attractive because essentially

424
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,079
it's you have your first semester you

425
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,120
have your four classes that you take

426
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,959
your first semester and after that the

427
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,440
world is your oyster so you build your

428
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,720
own experience and so for me um coming

429
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,480
from an engineering background um a lot

430
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,439
of the um the classes I took were all

431
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,839
like brand new to me like taking like

432
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,240
econ Finance but I was hyperfocused on I

433
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,720
knew I wanted to um do a career switch

434
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,079
into finance and so a lot of the classes

435
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,079
I took were Finance um Rel related

436
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,959
classes and what I really liked about

437
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,480
the MIT

438
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:28,559
curriculum dmit curriculum and classes

439
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,600
um was compared to like um other schools

440
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,039
um other business schools a lot of the

441
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,880
MIT folks were people who were like me

442
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,640
like where were all career switchers so

443
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,280
a lot of the classes like these are

444
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,600
Finance professors who are like world

445
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,600
renowned um Finance professors but they

446
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,960
more than happy to break it down for you

447
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,360
where there's no question literally no

448
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,640
question is a dumb question and and even

449
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
if you feel like it's a dumb question

450
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,880
and you ask it once again the people at

451
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,799
MIT are so low ego hump like no one is

452
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,720
is judging you no one is like oh my God

453
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,480
that was such a you know stupid question

454
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,120
or anything like that so that was very I

455
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,400
was able to get very comfortable in

456
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,039
classes where I was so um I built my own

457
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,440
um my my build my own experience was

458
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,559
focused mainly on taking um heavy

459
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,280
Finance classes however MIT is also a

460
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:25,520
huge huge huge um entrepreneurship Hub

461
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,480
and the entrepreneurial spirit is very

462
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,840
very uh big at MIT so there are lots of

463
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,440
class classes and labs and things that

464
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,200
you can take as well um to be able to

465
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,880
like you know grow in that area so I

466
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,480
took some as well also um where where um

467
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,559
for one of the classes that I took um

468
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,640
you have a real life like real world

469
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:50,080
problem so um one of the the classes I

470
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,600
took was um we had a project where we

471
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,960
had to work with uh ab and Bev which is

472
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,240
one of the biggest like uh beverage

473
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,080
manufacturers in the world and we had a

474
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,559
real project where they had a real

475
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,080
business problem in um the for their um

476
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,880
South America operations and so we

477
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,200
worked on it during the semester and

478
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
then during our break we actually got to

479
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,760
travel to Mexico City and spend three

480
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,960
weeks in Mexico City where we were

481
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,080
working on real life like problems

482
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,960
meeting with um their senior leadership

483
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,240
in in South America learning what their

484
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,880
issues were like um and coming up with

485
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,480
solutions for the for the issues that

486
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,679
they were having so these are like real

487
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,200
world challenges or real world problems

488
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,240
that we got to um work on and solve um

489
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,120
uh through through classes at MIT so

490
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,640
that that to me was um something that

491
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,440
was very attractive when I was going

492
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,400
through the application process as

493
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,640
well thank you for sharing I know

494
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
experience your learning is really big

495
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,280
here at Sloan especially the the action

496
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,679
learning Labs that we have but also the

497
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,120
the the opportunity to kind of get in

498
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,960
the the weeds and be able to actually

499
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,480
experience it um in real time um so

500
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,120
Morgan or KY did you all want to share

501
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,760
about the curriculum that you all

502
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,240
experienced um sure um so I think uh a l

503
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,400
many similarities but some differences

504
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,120
right so um when you know it says that

505
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,360
the program is a year it is literally SE

506
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,799
65 days I mean people were coming and

507
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,720
right it's just as International so

508
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,480
people were coming you know just before

509
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,000
Memorial Day weekend that's the last

510
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,960
weekend in May for those of you not

511
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,799
familiar um probably still finishing

512
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,960
their jobs through June 15th right so it

513
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:31,159
was very very tight and um

514
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,760
another I think unique part of the

515
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,240
program is that um it is it is skewing

516
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,200
differently now but it has historically

517
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,400
been the case that for many of the

518
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,400
executive programs um the students are

519
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,480
sponsored which means that while we do

520
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,039
have a lot of flexibility the people

521
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,280
that are really going back to their

522
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,120
employers probably not in the same roles

523
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,000
but at least going back to their

524
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,360
employers um there's an expectation that

525
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,720
they have a certain type of training

526
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,880
right um I was not in that camp so I had

527
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,240
a lot of freedom um and what that meant

528
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,480
then was our core our so summer we're

529
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,840
basically by ourselves although we

530
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,960
started to notice that there were lgs's

531
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,559
in the hall um and so it's very quiet um

532
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,080
and then you kind of Hit the rest of the

533
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,880
campus uh return in the fall right so

534
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:16,240
that's uh a major core we're going

535
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,320
through um kind of two terms in the span

536
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,760
right because we have basically if if

537
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,600
you think of it as a quarter system we

538
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
split our summer in half so it is very

539
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,520
intense that for summer is our core we

540
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,120
have eight classes that we're taking and

541
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,760
then um come fall and spring there are

542
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,240
really only two requirements where we're

543
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,279
all together and otherwise you have your

544
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,960
your pick um I uh you know because I was

545
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,559
kind of pivoting right so unique in that

546
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,240
I was not sponsored and unique in that I

547
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:47,720
was trying to Pivot in 365 days um it

548
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,360
kind of made life a nightmare um but it

549
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,080
was worth it right so um you know

550
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,039
usually you would do that right by not

551
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,640
just taking the classes but starting to

552
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,640
have some of the experiential learning

553
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,840
maybe even an internship to kind of get

554
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,200
get some experience on your resume to

555
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,559
prepare you for those conversations with

556
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,159
employers um I didn't have that luxury

557
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,159
of time but um Sloan offers kind of the

558
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,159
ability to do independent studies and so

559
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,000
it was Visa that that I negotiated an

560
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,400
internship or Consulting it was really

561
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,799
um with Mercedes which again came

562
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,279
through faculty and allowed me to get

563
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,440
some like real experience to say like

564
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,000
okay these are this is how I'm thinking

565
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,000
about these problems I'm starting to

566
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,360
understand the industry I have the

567
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,600
experience now and so I was I was in a

568
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,080
better position right when it came um

569
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,840
time for recruiting to talk about that

570
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,320
and so that was that was critical right

571
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,320
for me to have that independent study um

572
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,880
many of the kind of transportation and

573
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,240
Mobility related courses were outside of

574
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,640
Sloan um so I loved that I had enough

575
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,840
time and flexibility to venture into

576
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,559
some of the other departments and um and

577
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,840
then I and then I again I was there for

578
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,279
a year I was very committed to meeting

579
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,600
as many people as possible and getting

580
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,159
as much um you know of a of a spectrum

581
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,760
of of training as possible POS so I also

582
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,240
took classes at Harvard um and and that

583
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,720
come that kind of rounded out kind of

584
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,520
what I couldn't find at Sloan or or

585
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,080
elsewhere at MIT I was able to take at

586
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,159
Harvard and so happy to talk about that

587
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,039
from you um it's an interesting one in

588
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,919
the winter uh but it it was worth it

589
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,559
yeah and I can uh share a bit I think

590
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,120
the slone fellows um and lgo program has

591
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:22,480
some s similarities in terms of that

592
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,520
schedule so we start in summer as well

593
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,279
and so we we had eight courses over that

594
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,640
summer and so we kind of had like two

595
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,600
course semesters one course semester

596
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,440
during the summer where we're doing

597
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,600
engineering and um some some business

598
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,400
courses but it's more like a engineering

599
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,840
kind of core during that summer um and

600
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
then during the fall of course we have

601
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,080
the core with the rest of the mbas which

602
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,760
is focused on those main business

603
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,679
experiences I think to with the lgo

604
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,360
program there is still flexibility

605
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,679
although like you have to take your

606
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,039
engineering courses simultaneously with

607
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,600
your MBA courses so it it is a mix but

608
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,799
you still have the freedom to decide

609
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,600
like what your elective are and so I was

610
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,080
able to actually do the sustainability

611
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,559
certificate um during my time and so I

612
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,919
did the sustainability business lab

613
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,320
which is the action learning lab which

614
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,279
is a great experience got to work with

615
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,080
um a company there on a sustainability

616
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,880
project and so you still in the lgo

617
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,960
program get the freedom same freedom and

618
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,240
flexibility to take any electives that

619
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,240
you're truly really interested

620
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,760
in thank you all for sharing and

621
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,919
something that we get um in the

622
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,559
admissions office From perspective

623
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,480
students is the fact that there are

624
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,360
certificate programs affiliated with the

625
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,559
MBA and the LG program as well as some

626
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,880
fellows uh have you all had did you all

627
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,640
have any experience with the certificate

628
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,720
programs while you were here and if so

629
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,200
could you all share which program you

630
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,600
participated

631
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,159
in yeah I can uh start there so the

632
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,600
sustainability certificate is um what I

633
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,159
chose to pursue and that's through the

634
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,600
MIT uh slow sustainability initiative

635
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,600
and uh that was a great experience for

636
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,159
me I think sustainability is something

637
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,440
I've always been really interested in

638
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159
and um one of the reasons why I also

639
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,360
decided to go to grad school was to kind

640
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,399
of learn more about that space and so

641
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,440
through the sustainability initiative

642
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,279
they really kind of just give you a

643
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,799
really well-rounded training of

644
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,640
understanding sustainability from a

645
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,120
business perspective from a societal

646
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,240
perspective um and also just how you can

647
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,559
solve real problems um in the space

648
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,279
through the business lens and you do

649
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,559
this through coursework um you are

650
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,559
required to do action learning learning

651
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,520
lab as well so you get that actual

652
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,720
practical experience of doing a

653
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,360
sustainability project with um with a

654
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,240
company but then you also get the

655
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,159
community aspect so the other folks who

656
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,200
are doing the sustainability certificate

657
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,320
you build community with them as well

658
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,200
and that for me was a big part of it

659
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,760
because you learn from each other

660
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,880
everyone's coming from different angles

661
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,960
there are folks who are interested in

662
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
energy there are folks who are

663
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,159
interested in food there's folks who are

664
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,640
interested in cpg and like across this

665
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,559
just across every kind of sustainability

666
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,840
angle you can think of and so it's just

667
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,279
a great melding of Mind of folks who are

668
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,880
passionate about something and so I

669
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,840
think that's what's cool about their

670
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,559
certificate programs and you're you have

671
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,159
a a group of people who are interested

672
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,399
or passionate about a topic but they're

673
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,640
all coming from it at different angles

674
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:16,640
um so I really appreciate

675
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,159
that so I will actually add something so

676
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,720
while I I personally did not get a

677
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,640
certificate what I do know about MIT is

678
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,279
MIT is one of the only programs that

679
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:34,000
like I think has the um the

680
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:36,320
sustainability certificate and the MIT

681
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,679
sustainability certificate is one of the

682
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,600
only certificates that is actually uh

683
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,200
recognized like industrywide like no

684
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,399
matter what industry you're going into

685
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,159
if you mentioned um you have a

686
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:48,760
sustainability certificate a lot of

687
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,159
different um organizations have their

688
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,080
own sustainability like uh tracks so

689
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,320
like say I don't know if you worked at

690
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,279
GE for example they have like some

691
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,640
sustainability training that they you

692
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:04,679
can do um at GE however if you get an

693
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,159
MIT one it's usually industry um it's

694
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,159
recognized industry F just wanted to add

695
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,279
that awesome so we we've talked about

696
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,279
the curriculum we've talked about your

697
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,600
your paths to MIT Sloan so now we're

698
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,720
going to talk about ways that you can

699
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,520
leverage the alumni community so could

700
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,760
you all share what your experience has

701
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,640
been like as an Alum but also while you

702
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,520
in the program what ways did you

703
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,360
leverage the alumni community maybe as

704
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,159
it pertains to internships or maybe as

705
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,039
it pertains to just you know just

706
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,039
brainstorm sessions the ways that you

707
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,600
were able to have postgraduation uh

708
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,840
success so just kind of talk about the

709
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,840
ways that you Leverage The Alumni

710
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,399
network yeah I can start um wow okay so

711
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,720
I mean from the

712
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,799
moment uh so our orientation is in April

713
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,360
before we start um from that moment we

714
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,880
are meant to be recruiting and

715
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,480
developing a career plan right so um

716
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,000
it's really from that moment we already

717
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,919
meet kind of the outgoing cohort um and

718
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,559
whoever stays in the area because many

719
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,120
people end up staying right in Cambridge

720
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,679
or or the Greater Boston area um so

721
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,679
already I felt like I was walking

722
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:23,360
into like a network that was much larger

723
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,000
than my class um and that didn't stop

724
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,720
right so you know as I spent more time

725
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,640
and um you know spent time with the

726
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,919
career advisor spent time with people on

727
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,000
campus um was like always connected with

728
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,799
you know classes further and further out

729
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,480
um so that was a constant I mean I I

730
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,240
think there probably other than the

731
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,519
holidays there wasn't a week where I

732
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,360
wasn't talking to some Alum to

733
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:51,039
understand how why what right did you do

734
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,080
to like turn this experience into

735
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,399
something that worked for you um so I

736
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,440
think that was just that was just a very

737
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:00,159
much a part of the the the ethos right I

738
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,840
think it's and and I think that's

739
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:07,240
important actually I think you know

740
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,960
while it was MIT or nothing for me um

741
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,559
because I also understand that like

742
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,440
business works because of the network I

743
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:19,320
was worried about the size of MIT um

744
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,760
that being said the the size is an

745
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,919
active size right so it's almost more

746
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,320
meaningful because I think the way that

747
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,320
people show up the you know what what is

748
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,440
the SLO there's a actual slogan that's I

749
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,760
think

750
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,559
um you about no well for us though like

751
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,120
no fellow Left Behind is what it's is

752
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,600
what our slan is and and that is that

753
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,519
that's it's it rings true through and

754
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,519
through um and so you know from a just

755
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,960
feeling like people had my back in terms

756
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,159
of like how I should spend my time at

757
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,440
Sloan how I should start thinking about

758
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,000
what I'm going to do after Sloan um it

759
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,039
was it was probable right so I was not

760
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,440
walking only into a an immediate

761
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,760
Community right of 115 people I was

762
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,679
already walking out into the world with

763
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,720
like MIT at my side um and a very very

764
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,320
real example of this is um so when I

765
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,200
took this current role um I ended up

766
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:17,279
moving to a new place um I am now in

767
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Michigan and I knew no one um you know I

768
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,120
so I was like okay I know my colleague I

769
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,880
mean there's obviously there's a big

770
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,679
Ford presence um many of the Fords also

771
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,279
went to Sloan uh right so there were

772
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,159
lots of connections there already but um

773
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:34,880
it was the the PE how I ended up finding

774
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,519
a home how I ended up finding like all

775
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:42,360
of my like Health Care needs and social

776
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:45,080
needs and um just like even where to you

777
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:49,880
know where's my local post office uh was

778
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:53,200
because I was literally hosted by a a

779
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,000
Sloan fellow who who did not know me um

780
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,360
off of a connection right so immediately

781
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,080
just opened his home to me um allowed me

782
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,320
to spend weekends there as I was like

783
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,480
commuting back and forth between New

784
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,080
York and Michigan trying to make this

785
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,240
move real um I I knew nothing of this

786
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,320
person before um an email um interaction

787
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,480
and like just I mean felt safe felt like

788
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,519
we had known each other forever um but I

789
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,760
and and and now you know the the the

790
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,320
kind of passing it down is like I am

791
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,320
meant to recruit more people to Detroit

792
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,360
so um you know I think it really it is

793
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,639
not you know just words it really is

794
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,399
action um it's really the mind and hand

795
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:31,279
thing that it might um brings to life

796
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,679
and and I can tell you it's it's it's

797
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,679
it's real in so many

798
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,960
ways yeah I can try in in terms of the

799
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:47,480
alumni I think um for me I pursued

800
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,639
Consulting um after graduating Sloan and

801
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,120
definitely relied on Alum there as well

802
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:55,559
so like hearing what their experience

803
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,159
was doing practice case interviews um

804
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,679
and really you know folks are are will

805
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,080
to to take their time um out of their

806
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:06,120
busy busy schedules to to do a case

807
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,399
interview um and so that I I really

808
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,000
appreciate it and I think oftentimes

809
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,880
folks are just willing to take time for

810
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,080
a conversation and I think a lot of us

811
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,840
are talking about career switching and

812
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,559
so like that was a career switch for me

813
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,720
and so people are always willing to just

814
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,440
chat with you about kind of what their

815
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,159
what their career currently is and give

816
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,440
you perspective of like you know how you

817
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,039
could potentially break in and so I just

818
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,000
think that uh a um are very approachable

819
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:35,399
um for Sloan and I I can't speak to

820
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,600
obviously any other programs but I I

821
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,559
really appreciated that and and I felt

822
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,039
that I never really felt like I couldn't

823
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,679
just reach out to someone and say like

824
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,600
hey like I'm you know I'm at Sloan as

825
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,720
well and see that you graduated even if

826
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,159
they graduated 10 years ago or something

827
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,480
you know folks are are willing to to

828
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,960
connect with

829
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:58,399
you uh rounding off uh Echo everything

830
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,000
Morgan and K have said um for me I

831
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,639
really leverag the Alum Network during

832
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,840
my recruiting um Journey so it was

833
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,760
really like finding like I would find

834
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,120
the company that I was interested in and

835
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,679
I'd find an alarm in the company and I

836
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,159
just reach out just be like hey you know

837
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,399
I'm trying to make this switch from

838
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,559
engineering into this I noticed you're

839
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:24,080
at this company can you spend 15 minutes

840
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,600
of your time and usually response like

841
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,919
once again once you they see the at

842
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,440
mit.edu it's like what can I do for you

843
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,080
like how can I help so it's like you

844
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,720
know I'm trying to do this I'm trying

845
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,240
okay well I mean my company's not

846
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,360
hireing right now but I know someone

847
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,799
else who is and then you just kind of

848
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,760
you just start to to Branch out and your

849
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,600
network just continues to grow and grow

850
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,840
from there so I can't um speak highly

851
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,360
enough of the MIT uh Alumni network and

852
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,440
just their willingness to help and so

853
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,720
once you then become an Alum you're also

854
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,399
willing to because you know what the

855
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,440
expectation is now and you know what the

856
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:00,039
people who went before you have done and

857
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,679
so now there's that expectation on you

858
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,559
as well so for me personally once I once

859
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,600
again see at mit.edu always happy to

860
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,440
help my phone line is always open

861
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,200
willing to always take 15 minutes of my

862
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,119
time to help out another

863
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,520
SL awesome this great and I know with uh

864
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,280
paying it forward nature here at Sloan

865
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,159
um could you all kind of share some

866
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,119
additional information as it pertains to

867
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,760
like generating more representation of

868
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,240
the black and African-American Community

869
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,359
Ed loan and how it extends not just

870
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,000
within the NBA program but out to all of

871
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,919
our programs so just talk about ways

872
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,679
that we're you know advocating for more

873
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,320
representation within our program could

874
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,119
you highlight any mentorship programs

875
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,000
that we have in um in an in an active

876
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,000
State here at

877
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,560
SLO so I could I could start since I

878
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:56,760
left off last time um so uh so while I

879
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,480
was while I was um at MIT and even now

880
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,880
to a certain extent

881
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:08,480
um what as a member of both uh bbsa and

882
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,240
um and uh ABC both organizations had uh

883
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,160
buddy programs and Buddy systems so what

884
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,880
that means is um for folks who are

885
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,040
applying to um to the programs they

886
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:26,560
could reach out to the leadership of the

887
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,599
of the of both um uh uh of both clubs

888
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,200
and say Hey you know I'm very interested

889
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,320
in learning about this you know can I be

890
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,160
connected to someone who's like you know

891
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,200
a current student um who is willing to

892
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,440
like listen to my story um help me with

893
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,520
like interviews help me with my um

894
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:49,040
application things like that and so that

895
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,359
was very helpful for me coming in like

896
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,160
because when I was coming in um I didn't

897
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,079
know about this uh but once I got in I

898
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,640
iMed it like okay hey this is something

899
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,400
we have to do because we need to

900
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,800
increase our representation so usually

901
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,599
like there would be different rounds

902
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,960
obviously like you have you know round

903
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,280
one round two round three and so every

904
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,359
round um or in each round you know take

905
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,200
a few uh prospective uh candidates and

906
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,560
just kind of you know talk them through

907
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,599
my experience listen to their story help

908
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,119
them refine their story things like that

909
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,119
and I wasn't the only one doing it like

910
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,000
there were multiple like I think all of

911
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,599
the um all of and it wasn't just even

912
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,280
the the black community all the

913
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,319
communities of color you know um the

914
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,079
latinx community um the South Asian

915
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:37,240
Community everybody had something

916
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,760
similar and so um once again but it just

917
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,280
goes back to the um Spirit of SL of

918
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,520
giving back so that was a thing like so

919
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,480
just mentorship of like prospective um

920
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,960
candidates and as a second year also

921
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,800
giving back to the first years as well

922
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,599
making sure you know everyone is good no

923
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,680
one is struggling in classes what do you

924
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,680
need things like

925
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,640
that we going to K El you wanted to add

926
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,640
to

927
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,920
that I I think that the Buddy program

928
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,400
definitely was probably the first thing

929
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,400
that came to mind there um I think that

930
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,280
there's also oftentimes informal members

931
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,520
uh mentorship that happens um a lot so

932
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,560
it doesn't always have to be do formal

933
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,440
programs um but for the LGL program

934
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,240
specifically there is a mentor program

935
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:27,000
where you get matched um with and Alum

936
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,920
and they did really try to emphasize for

937
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,960
the uh women and diverse like students

938
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,920
who are part of the lgo program trying

939
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,000
to match with lgo alum in that same area

940
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,000
and so and there is that as

941
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,520
well awesome awesome so uh I see we're

942
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,079
about at 7:45 eastern time so I want to

943
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,720
give us an opportunity to be able to

944
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,880
Pivot to you know some questions from

945
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,680
our audience that came in in the Q&A so

946
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,160
we do have a few that came in um one

947
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,200
that I want to highlight is specifically

948
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,800
about the uh the black experience and

949
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,520
the Boston area so all could you all

950
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,200
kind of share like what your experience

951
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,760
was like on and off campus as somebody

952
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,280
um that may have migrated to the Boston

953
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
area whether it's for for graduate

954
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,359
school or somebody that was just for

955
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,440
that was there maybe for undergrad can

956
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:14,280
you all talk about the experience for a

957
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,480
black person within the Greater Boston

958
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,760
area and ways that you found community

959
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,760
at Sloan but also outside of

960
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,680
Sloan I I can speak to that um so G

961
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,280
given that I'm from New York I think New

962
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:34,359
York and and right have their rival and

963
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,200
so I didn't know much about Boston and I

964
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:39,480
had heard similar things in terms of it

965
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,359
being potentially unwelcoming but um for

966
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,160
fortunately that that was not my

967
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,599
experience I think Boston is much more

968
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:50,640
diverse than people um give give credit

969
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:52,640
um to it and so I think exploring the

970
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,920
different communities kind of outside of

971
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,920
Cambridge going to Roxberry Dorchester

972
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,760
you know having some Haitian food food

973
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,520
and um just getting outside of the kind

974
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,640
of Cambridge bubble is really important

975
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,160
and I think you'd be surprised at at how

976
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:12,040
diverse it actually is um much more than

977
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,040
I think people people give it credit

978
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,800
for oh sorry Morgan CUO not much more to

979
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,560
add I mean I think honestly it's what

980
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,760
you make it right I I just you know if

981
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,760
you if you haven't moved a lot it will

982
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,680
always be a shock I think if you if

983
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,079
you've moved a lot I think you know the

984
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,920
Pains of like what does it take to like

985
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,200
find your Necessities what does it take

986
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,720
to find a broader Community I you know I

987
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,640
think to the point of the bubble like it

988
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,640
works for and against you I think you

989
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,680
don't have to experience great Boston if

990
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,200
you don't want to um in some ways you

991
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,960
are protected as a student um but if you

992
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,760
are interested in it I think there's a

993
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,599
lot to learn and it has a lot to offer

994
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,119
right it is one of the major US cities

995
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,960
um you know I I kept like my gym

996
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,480
membership that I had at home so like

997
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,839
then I had like a whole gym crew that I

998
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,040
was meeting in Somerville it's a place

999
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,400
of like this is probably not even right

1000
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,599
anymore but when I was in underg like

1001
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,440
had at least 27

1002
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,560
universities just near city center right

1003
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:19,800
and so you know in terms of just like

1004
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:23,040
the the population of people that are

1005
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,480
you know are probably around your age

1006
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,960
um certainly intellectual in nature um

1007
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,960
um and and probably also transient so

1008
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,119
like are trying to figure out like how

1009
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,760
do I navigate this like you're not alone

1010
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:40,000
in that right so both within MIT and I

1011
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:43,400
think at large there's just a a broader

1012
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
um student and professional population

1013
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,200
um of color and not right that's

1014
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,520
accessible to you um uh if you if you

1015
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,280
love sports I mean it's again if it's as

1016
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
a major city it has things that will

1017
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,800
bring people together like sports like

1018
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,119
music right like like the Arts um um I

1019
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,440
definitely recommend going to the museum

1020
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,280
they have like an after dark thing you

1021
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,200
know once a month which is like akin to

1022
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,359
like the New York like culture that I

1023
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,920
loved so like I sought those things um I

1024
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,280
was also partial to New York so like you

1025
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:17,000
know the food is the food but it's it's

1026
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,000
survivable you're there for a period of

1027
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,319
time uh rounding us off so um for me I

1028
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,920
spent most of my time in Cambridge

1029
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:26,359
because I mean school was in Cambridge

1030
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,319
and there's a lot of stuff to do in

1031
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:32,280
Cambridge um but post uh uh business

1032
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,280
school I've stayed in the Boston area

1033
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,240
and like I think K mentioned this

1034
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,720
earlier like everyone has like you know

1035
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,280
prior to moving here I'd always heard of

1036
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,240
Boston not being as welcoming as you

1037
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,560
know as it can be um first of like

1038
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,960
Cambridge is the total like opposite of

1039
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,280
what I was expecting like just once I

1040
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,000
got there just the number that the

1041
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,560
diversity in Cambridge ising you meet

1042
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,720
people from every background you can

1043
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,680
think of and I think Morgan also

1044
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:05,680
mentioned this where um there are so

1045
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,680
many schools in the Boston area where um

1046
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,000
even expanding out of Cambridge you're

1047
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,319
still meeting a lot of like younger um

1048
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,319
like-minded individuals who are here you

1049
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:17,839
know to get an education or early in

1050
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,079
their career and so it's easy to network

1051
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,480
and really build a network uh from that

1052
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,640
so I I will say that about the Boston

1053
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,640
there great and as somebody that

1054
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,000
migrated here from this

1055
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,000
uh coming here from Florida about 2 and

1056
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,680
a half years ago um it was a coaching

1057
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,599
shop for me but being able to come here

1058
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,280
with a significant other was a huge help

1059
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,839
for me I know everybody doesn't have

1060
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,040
that luxury but also being uh a part of

1061
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,440
you know uh a fraternity um that also

1062
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,880
was a big help being able to kind of

1063
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,240
Leverage that a particular community so

1064
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,920
there's a lot of ways that students can

1065
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,200
get connected if they have things that

1066
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,760
they're affiliated with also one thing

1067
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,000
about Boston I think that's you know

1068
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,000
relatively unknown is the fact that the

1069
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,400
the there is a very a very large Melting

1070
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Pot here as it pertains to different you

1071
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,440
know cultures so when I was

1072
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,599
transitioning here I didn't know that we

1073
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,839
had such a large Haitian population or a

1074
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,359
large K Verdian population being able to

1075
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,160
find those particular communities within

1076
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:12,079
Boston like K mentioned in terms of you

1077
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,640
know Roxberry and Dorchester being able

1078
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,800
to have these different Pockets where

1079
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,640
you can kind of find a sense of home or

1080
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,200
a sense of comfort also Boston has a

1081
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,240
very rich black history uh here as well

1082
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,520
so being able to you know to tap into

1083
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,559
you know where Martin Luther King went

1084
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,559
the school or being able to you know

1085
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,240
have the black her is within the area

1086
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,599
but there's a lot of black history here

1087
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,319
that I don't think people really know

1088
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,440
about and the the the country was you

1089
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,240
know technically built on the backs of

1090
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,520
black people so we have a strong DNA

1091
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,319
within the city of Boston so I want to

1092
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,000
be able to have students tap into that

1093
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,839
versus looking at it from you know a

1094
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,760
hesitation perspective or maybe from a

1095
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,960
deficit perspective so there's a lot

1096
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,040
that Boston has to offer and we also

1097
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,760
mentioned ways that we have integrated

1098
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,559
um uh culture within the the program so

1099
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,760
one thing that we do um within the Sloan

1100
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,200
program is have course 15 dinners where

1101
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,760
students are actually going out in the

1102
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,200
community and having dinners not just

1103
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,440
with Sloan students but students from

1104
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,599
all across MIT so able to kind of build

1105
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,000
those networks so the the the best way

1106
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:12,119
to kind of have those conversations is

1107
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,800
over a good meal of food and our our

1108
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,839
Student Life office does a great job of

1109
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,480
being able to kind of find um hidden

1110
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,559
gyms within the Boston area that people

1111
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,119
find uh really comforting and being able

1112
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,200
to have that Community Support so um I

1113
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,079
want people to you know feel empowered

1114
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,160
to you know consider SL as an option and

1115
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,160
don't you know at Boston as almost a

1116
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,359
negative aspect being able to say okay

1117
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,640
what is Boston doing to be able to

1118
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:35,079
attract me within the program and I

1119
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,720
think having those small pockets of

1120
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:38,319
communities will be helpful and I think

1121
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,319
we need to do a better job of amplifying

1122
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,280
those voices within the Greater Boston

1123
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,800
area so I you know no we're getting

1124
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,240
close to time but I want to be able to

1125
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,000
transition to our um next process so I

1126
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,440
want to give a action item for our

1127
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,520
panelists something to think about as we

1128
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,160
go through these next slides so if you

1129
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,599
all were to give a a piece of advice to

1130
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,839
prospective students as they going

1131
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,079
through this process uh just you know

1132
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,400
you just kind of think about that for

1133
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,920
now but I'll come back to you all to

1134
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,800

00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,119
good awesome so I want to um highlight

1136
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,400

1168
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,119
great uh sense of confirmation for a lot

1169
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,160
of people that you know see Salone as

1170
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,760
option but sitting on the class does uh

1171
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,240
uh hit different in a way being able to

1172
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,680
kind of say okay I can see myself here

1173
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,319
as somebody that may be from a technical

1174
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,920
background or from a non-traditional

1175
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,319
background we want to be able to have

1176
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,520
that opportunity for students to be able

1177
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:31,920
to have that sense of uh comfort and

1178
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,640
then the last thing I want to talk about

1179
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,400
is ways that you can learn more about

1180
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,119
diversity and inclusion here at Mi sloom

1181
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,319
and our black business student Community

1183
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,040

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,839
from tonight's session about the the the

1185
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,960
uh the leadership so feel free to reach

1186
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,839
out to them I know we mentioned tonight

1187
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,960
the Buddy program so that's a great

1188
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,359
resource for students that are going

1189
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,359
through the perspective application

1190
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:55,880
Phase to be able to reach out to our

1191
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:57,760
first year and second year students to

1192
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,280
talk about ways that they can make a

1193
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,040
more competitive application as they're

1194
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,520
going through the particular process so

1195
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,000
I want to come back to our panelist to

1196
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,520
wrap up for tonight's session so just

1197
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,559
you know just share a piece of advice

1198
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,960
that you would give to a prospective

1199
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,599
black applicant as they're going through

1200
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:16,240
this particular

1201
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:18,000
process I can start I think the number

1202
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,920
one thing that's important in the

1203
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,440
application process is to really bring

1204
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,160
your whole self um to your application

1205
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,359
and I really mean that I think that

1206
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,400
that's something that

1207
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:34,400
slown missions really uh takes into

1208
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,520
consideration and they put a lot of work

1209
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,240
into building a really unique and

1210
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,359
diverse class and the experience of

1211
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,760
going to Sloan like I've met people from

1212
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,480
just so many different walks of life

1213
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,119
that I never experienced before even

1214
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,200
being from New York where you know I've

1215
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,880
met so many people from different places

1216
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,680
it wasn't until Sloan where I think I

1217
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,480
just learn so much just because of how

1218
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,079
much effort they put into really

1219
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,160
building a unique um in diverse class

1220
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,599
and the only way they can do that if is

1221
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,040
if they know like the true personality

1222
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,480
and experience of the people applying

1223
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,160
and so I would say really bring your

1224
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,960
whole self especially that video

1225
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,079
component bring your whole true self you

1226
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,559
know your personality to that and and

1227
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,800
don't be afraid to to bring yourself in

1228
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,800
that

1229
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:31,520
application okay I could jump in um my

1230
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:35,319
advice is apply because I know a lot of

1231
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,319
different people who they you know it's

1232
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:38,880
it's MIT you know you're very

1233
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:40,920
intimidated by the name you're

1234
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,240
intimidated and then you look at like

1235
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,359
you know all the different scores you

1236
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,040
look at you know the GPA requirements

1237
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,599
you look at all these things and it's

1238
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,400
very easy to get in your own head and

1239
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,599
Rule yourself out before anybody has a

1240
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,359
chance to rule you out so the if you

1241
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,240
don't apply or if you decide to rule

1242
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:02,400
yourself out you're never even going to

1243
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,319
give the admissions uh panel a chance to

1244
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,920
even review your application um and so

1245
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:11,359
my piece of advice is put your best foot

1246
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,799
forward um lean in strongly lean in

1247
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:17,799
heavily on like the the different um

1248
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:20,119
budy programs and the and these type of

1249
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:21,599
um events where you get to hear from

1250
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:23,720
different people lean into those

1251
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,799
experiences so that way you can get to

1252
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,599
know like um have some connection with

1253
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:29,920
uh the institution and when you're

1254
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:32,200
applying you're able to put your best

1255
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,200
foood

1256
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,680
forward so I think my advice is is

1257
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,440
probably a a a combination of the two

1258
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,839
but I think it's to know what you want

1259
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,280
to get out of the program um and maybe

1260
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,680
that's true of any business school but I

1261
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:50,240
think I think the I think having that

1262
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,040
Focus means that you will be very clear

1263
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,400
about

1264
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:57,520
then what at Sloan is available to help

1265
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,520
you achieve that um and what experience

1266
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,400
you bear that tells that story right and

1267
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:06,520
I think once you package that that

1268
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,880
becomes just your compass right through

1269
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,559
the admissions process and even through

1270
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,520
the program I mean even if you're here

1271
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:14,000
for the the the longest program I mean

1272
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,040
really being at Sloan is like being a

1273
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
kid in a candy store you time time could

1274
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,160
fly by and you could not do anything

1275
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,040
right and so I think it's just so

1276
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,839
important that you get out of this

1277
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,040
experience not only that you get in

1278
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:29,079
right but that you get out of this

1279
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,079
experience what you are so um strongly

1280
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:32,799
seeking right now and that can only be

1281
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,920
true the clearer you are and I'm not

1282
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:36,839
saying you need to know your next title

1283
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,799
or your next role or your next company

1284
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:40,400
but I am saying you need to be very

1285
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:42,720
clear about what it is you want out of

1286
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,319
this right what it is for yourself or

1287
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,440
what it is for your community what it is

1288
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,040
for your career what it right like what

1289
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,960
if it's a skill set based thing whatever

1290
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:54,000
it is let that be your right your guide

1291
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,480
tell your story around that figure out

1292
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,680
what at Sloan complements that and what

1293
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,280
you you can do to again contribute to

1294
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,559
that community and and Achieve that at

1295
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,559
the same time
