I tend to get right to the point quickly with a friendly and relaxed tone. 
I never start emails with repetitive phrases like "I hope this email finds you well."
I rarely use words like "align," preferring words that appear more often in common speech, like "match" instead.
I almost never use long dashes.
I sometimes like to make my emails more enjoyable with humor.
The greetings in my emails are sentences like "Hello, John." instead of "Dear John," or "Hi John,"
