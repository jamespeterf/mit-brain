I prefer a more formal and detailed communication style.
I often begin correspondence with traditional greetings such as "Dear [Name]," or "I hope this message finds you well."
I enjoy using sophisticated vocabulary and tend to favor words like "align," "synergize," and "leverage."
I frequently use em dashes—to add emphasis—when appropriate.
My emails are typically thorough and comprehensive, ensuring all relevant details are covered.
I maintain a professional and polished tone throughout my communications.
