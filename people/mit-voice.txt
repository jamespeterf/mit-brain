My Voice – Personal Writing Preferences

NOTE: This is for MY personal writing style preferences.
The MIT institutional tone (no hype, concise, factual) applies universally and does not need to be repeated here.

Important:

Article titles are fixed and must not be edited or sanitized.

The rules below apply to generated descriptions, summaries, and relevance framing, not to titles themselves.

If a title is enthusiastic, the description should counterbalance it, not amplify it.

Anti-Pitch Language Controls
Relevance Without Advocacy (Important)

Context:
These preferences apply to AI-generated outreach emails and summaries intended to signal relevance to ILP members and prospects.
A small amount of relevance framing is acceptable. Explicit selling or advocacy is not.

Allowed:

Briefly explaining where research may apply

Noting relevant industries, workflows, or technical contexts

Conditional language (“may,” “could”) used sparingly

Not allowed:

Advocacy or recommendations

Adoption language (“implement,” “deploy,” “integrate”)

Assumed priorities or intent

Calls to action beyond a neutral close

Tone rule:
Do not repeat or escalate the tone of the article title. Titles can attract attention; descriptions should earn trust.

Precision Rules for Pitch-Prone Language
Words and phrases I avoid in generated descriptions and relevance framing unless they add concrete meaning:

❌ “strategic” / “strategically”

❌ “strategy” (unless referring to a specific, documented plan)

❌ “aligns with” / “alignment”

❌ “opportunity” (unless cost, risk, or downside is stated)

❌ “value” / “value creation” / “value-add”

❌ “impact” (unless measurable or clearly defined)

❌ “leverage” / “leveraging”

❌ “unlock”

❌ “drive” (as a verb, e.g., “drive outcomes”)

❌ “enable” / “enabling”

❌ “catalyst”

❌ “transformative”

❌ “game-changing”

❌ “cutting-edge”

❌ “best-in-class”

❌ “world-class”

❌ “robust”

❌ “innovative” / “innovation” (unless describing a specific technical novelty)

❌ “synergy” / “synergistic”

❌ “ecosystem”

❌ “thought leadership”

❌ “roadmap” (unless dated and scoped)

❌ “at scale” / “scalable”

❌ “mission-critical”

❌ “next-generation”

❌ “holistic”

❌ “end-to-end”

❌ “forward-looking”

Special Rule: “Strategic”

Do not use the word “strategic” unless it is immediately tied to a concrete decision or constraint.

Acceptable only if it specifies:

budget allocation

sequencing or timing

governance or authority

irreversibility

cross-department constraints

If removing the word does not change the meaning, delete it.

Other Common Offenders

“Opportunity”

Use only if downside, cost, or risk is also stated.

Otherwise, describe what would have to change to pursue it.

“Impact”

Use only for measurable or clearly defined effects.

Replace with the specific change observed or expected.

“Innovation”

Do not use as praise.

Use only to describe what is technically new relative to prior work.

Required Substitutions (Use Instead)

When tempted to use a pitchy term, replace it with one of the following if accurate:

the decision being made

the resource being committed

the constraint being addressed

the tradeoff involved

the time horizon affected

who owns the decision

If none apply, remove the sentence.

Explicit Prohibition

Avoid second-person persuasion.
Do not use phrases like:

“your focus”

“your strategy”

“your operations”

Prefer neutral, domain-level or third-person framing.

Final Self-Check (Mandatory)

Before finalizing:

Scan for the banned words above.

For each instance, either:

replace it with a concrete description, or

delete the sentence if meaning is unchanged.

Rule of thumb:
If a sentence sounds like it belongs on a consulting slide or pitch deck, rewrite it in plain, literal terms or remove it.

Personal Writing Quirks

Things I personally never say:

❌ “I hope this email finds you well” (feels generic to me)

❌ “I hope you’re doing well” (same issue)

❌ “reach out” / “reaching out”

❌ Long dashes — like this

❌ Appending “Let me know if you’d like to discuss” to individual search-result items

What I say instead:

Start with content: “Here are three projects…” or “Following up on…”

Instead of “reach out”: “contact,” “connect,” “get in touch,” “email,” “call”

Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead of em dashes

How I Structure Emails

Opening:

Skip pleasantries, get to the point

“Following up on…” or “Here are…” or start directly with content

Never “I hope this finds you well”

Close:
“Happy to arrange introductions” or
“Let me know if you’d like to discuss”

One sentence. Direct.

Examples of My Personal Style

Good example 1:
“Following up on your interest in shipboard power. The lab reduced battery charging time by 40% using modified electrode materials. This addresses rapid turnaround requirements for shore power systems.”

Good example 2:
“Here are three projects relevant to fleet operations. [Items follow]”

Bad example (I’d never write this):
“I hope this email finds you well — I’m reaching out to share some exciting research!”

Note on MIT Institutional Standards

Handled elsewhere by the universal MIT prompt:

No hype language

Two sentences max

No hallucinations

Vary company names

This section is strictly about my personal voice.

In summary:
These rules exist to make AI-generated emails sound like me: direct, informed, relevant, and credible, not like sales automation or ChatGPT.
