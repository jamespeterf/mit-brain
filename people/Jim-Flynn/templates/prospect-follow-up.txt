Hi, {{PocFirstName}}.

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Based on our conversation. I believe {{Member}} is a strong fit for the MIT Industrial Liaison Program (ILP). 

As discussed, I've attached a one-pager on the ILP and a sample of our Letter of Agfreement (LOA).

Additionally, I did a quick scan and found some information that may be relevant to your interests, such as: 

**__EVENTS:__**

{{events}}

**__NEWS STORIES:__**

{{articles}}

**__VIDEOS:__**

{{videos}}

**__ACADEMIC PAPERS / ARTICLES:__**

{{papers}}

**__MIT-Connected Startups:__**

{{startups}}

This information should give you a reasonable idea of the types of people and groups in the MIT community that we connect ILP members to.

I'll follow up in a few weeks. In the meantime, please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or requests.

I look forward to continuing our conversation. 

Best regards,
Jim
